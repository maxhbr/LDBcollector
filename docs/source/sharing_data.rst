Data structure
===================================

Hermine's work relies on two types of data sets.


Sharable Data
-----------------------------------------

Hermine is a Free Open Source Software which promotes sharing of data that might be useful to other users. Thus, your are able to import and export data that will facilitate the work with Hermine. Nonetheless, you should consider that while part of this data is the result of **objective** deductions, another part is the outcome of an interpretation, and in this way is a **subjective** data. Including subjective data from a third party in your analysis is something that might save you time (especially the interpretation of licenses) but that might be inconsistent with your actual legal policy. Here is a list of data fields qualified as objective or subjective.


Non-Sharable Data
-----------------------------------------

Some data is produced by your work, depending on your projects and their dependencies. This mainly includes everything that is related to the BOM (Bill of Materials). This is the kind of data that is only relevant relatively to your project and that is not worth sharing with people that are not part of your project. This way, Hermine will not allow you to share this data.
