The maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the official version of Vim. What the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have to be sent again. [...]\r\n\r\nd) Wen you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the changes if the following three conditions are met: \r\n- You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them available to him. [...]\r\n\r\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org>",
