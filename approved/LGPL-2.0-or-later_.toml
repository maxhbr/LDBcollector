A GPL or LGPL licensed package that lacks any statement of what version that
it's licensed under in the source code/program output/accompanying docs is
technically licensed under *any* version of the GPL or LGPL, not just the
version in whatever COPYING file they include. Note that this is LGPLv2+, not
LGPL+, because version 2 was the first version of LGPL. Note that this license
was originally referred to as the GNU Library General Public License v2, but all
current versions (v2.1 or newer) of the license are correctly known as the GNU
Lesser General Public License.  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-
