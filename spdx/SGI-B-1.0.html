8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient&#39;s use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

                 Recipient may distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under
                 (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
                 necessary in order to clarify Recipient&amp;apos;s role as licensor of Modifications, without
                 derogation of any of SGI&amp;apos;s rights; and/or (3) a license of Recipient&amp;apos;s choosing, containing
                 terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and
                 Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
                 terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License,
                 Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License
                 are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI.
            &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
             Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
             sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
             License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature,
             must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;

             name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for
             purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior
             written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which
             shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted
             under this License are reserved.

             control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries.
             Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or
             contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other
             intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any
             representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law,
             it might be deemed to have been subject.

          Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any disposition of
             Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party&amp;apos;s intellectual
             property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
             time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a

             License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this

    8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
    9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
