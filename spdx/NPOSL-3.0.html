This Non-Profit Open Software License (&quot;Non-Profit OSL&quot;) version 3.0 (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

     Licensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;

     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work;

     c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d);

     d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

     e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or &quot;fair dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys&#39; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the &quot;Open Software License&quot; or &quot;OSL&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (&quot;OSL 3.0&quot;) is &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:

     (a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.

     (b) The first sentence of Section 7 [&quot;Warranty of Provenance&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

     (c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [&quot;Limitation of Liability&quot;] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes &quot;direct&quot; damages.

     (d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License&quot; rather than the &quot;Open Software License&quot;. You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.

     (e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference &quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0&quot; in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public,

            to display the Original Work publicly.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2)&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
             sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are
             embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
             to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative
             Works.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3)&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Source Code License. The term &amp;quot;Source Code&amp;quot; means the preferred form of the
             Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to
             modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
             Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
             Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of
             the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
             convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
             Work.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4)&lt;/var&gt;
          Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors
             to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
             promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the
             Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
             Licensor&amp;apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
             property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or
             import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
             No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the
             Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
             licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
             would have a right to license.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5)&lt;/var&gt;
          External Deployment. The term &amp;quot;External Deployment&amp;quot; means the use, distribution, or
             communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work
             or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed
             or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a
             network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
             External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under
             section 1(c).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6)&lt;/var&gt;
          Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
             all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well
             as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
             &amp;quot;Attribution Notice.&amp;quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that
             You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients
             that You have modified the Original Work.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7)&lt;/var&gt;
          Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this
             License on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
             including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
             for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
             This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the
             Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8)&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort
             (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages
             for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
             commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent
             applicable law prohibits such limitation.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9)&lt;/var&gt;
          Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent
             indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
             conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the
             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by
             copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
             copyright exceptions and limitations (including &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair
             dealing&amp;quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of
             the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
             1(c).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10)&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
             exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
             action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
             that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
             action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
             or hardware.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11)&lt;/var&gt;
          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought
             only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
             conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
             the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside
             the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
             penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall
             survive the termination of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12)&lt;/var&gt;
          Attorneys&amp;apos; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages
             relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
             including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and costs incurred in
             connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive
             the termination of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13)&lt;/var&gt;
          Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
             be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14)&lt;/var&gt;
          Definition of &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; in This License. &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; throughout this License, whether
             in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and
             complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; includes
             any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes
             of this definition, &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
             direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
             fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
             entity.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15)&lt;/var&gt;
          Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned
             by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for
             such uses by You.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16)&lt;/var&gt;
          Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is
             granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
             License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative
             Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate
             your modified version (the &amp;quot;Modified License&amp;quot;) and apply it to other original works
             of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that
             your Modified License is the &amp;quot;Open Software License&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;OSL&amp;quot; and you may
             not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice
             specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &amp;quot;Licensed under &amp;lt;insert your
             license name here&amp;gt;&amp;quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to
             the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
             source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI)
             and You comply with its license review and certification process.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 17)&lt;/var&gt;
          Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (&amp;quot;OSL
             3.0&amp;quot;) is &amp;quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0&amp;quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license
             has been amended as follows:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no
               revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof,
               or from support or services relating thereto.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
            The first sentence of Section 7 [&amp;quot;Warranty of Provenance&amp;quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been
               stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO
               WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
            In the first sentence of Section 8 [&amp;quot;Limitation of Liability&amp;quot;] of this Non-Profit
               OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes
               &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; damages.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (d)&lt;/var&gt;
            The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this &amp;quot;Non-Profit Open Software
               License&amp;quot; rather than the &amp;quot;Open Software License&amp;quot;. You may distribute or
               communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0
               license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this
               Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative
               Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices
               so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to
               distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under
               the original OSL 3.0 license.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Original Works licensed under this license shall reference &amp;quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0&amp;quot; in
               licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0
               license.

This Non-Profit Open Software License (&quot;Non-Profit OSL&quot;) version 3.0 (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.

Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or &quot;fair dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

   8) Limitation of Liability.

This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

   10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

   11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.

             Licensor&amp;apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
             property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or
             import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
             No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the
             Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
             licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
             would have a right to license.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5)&lt;/var&gt;
          External Deployment. The term &amp;quot;External Deployment&amp;quot; means the use, distribution, or
             communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work
             or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed
             or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a
             network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
             External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under
             section 1(c).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6)&lt;/var&gt;
          Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
             all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well
             as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
             &amp;quot;Attribution Notice.&amp;quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that
             You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients
             that You have modified the Original Work.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7)&lt;/var&gt;
          Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this
             License on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
             including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
             for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
             This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the
             Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8)&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort
             (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages
             for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
             commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent
             applicable law prohibits such limitation.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9)&lt;/var&gt;
          Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent
             indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
             conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the
             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by
             copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
             copyright exceptions and limitations (including &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair
             dealing&amp;quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of
             the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
             1(c).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10)&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
             exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
             action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
             that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
             action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
             or hardware.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11)&lt;/var&gt;
          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought
             only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
             conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
             the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside
             the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
             penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall
             survive the termination of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12)&lt;/var&gt;
          Attorneys&amp;apos; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages
             relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
             including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and costs incurred in
             connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive
             the termination of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13)&lt;/var&gt;
          Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
             be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14)&lt;/var&gt;
          Definition of &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; in This License. &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; throughout this License, whether
             in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and
             complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; includes
             any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes
             of this definition, &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
             direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
             fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
             entity.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15)&lt;/var&gt;
          Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned
             by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for
             such uses by You.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16)&lt;/var&gt;
          Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is
             granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
             License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative
             Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate
             your modified version (the &amp;quot;Modified License&amp;quot;) and apply it to other original works
             of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that
             your Modified License is the &amp;quot;Open Software License&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;OSL&amp;quot; and you may
             not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice
             specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &amp;quot;Licensed under &amp;lt;insert your
             license name here&amp;gt;&amp;quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to
             the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
             source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI)
             and You comply with its license review and certification process.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 17)&lt;/var&gt;
          Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (&amp;quot;OSL
             3.0&amp;quot;) is &amp;quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0&amp;quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license
             has been amended as follows:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no
               revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof,
               or from support or services relating thereto.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
            The first sentence of Section 7 [&amp;quot;Warranty of Provenance&amp;quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been
               stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO
               WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
            In the first sentence of Section 8 [&amp;quot;Limitation of Liability&amp;quot;] of this Non-Profit
               OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes
               &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; damages.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (d)&lt;/var&gt;
            The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this &amp;quot;Non-Profit Open Software
               License&amp;quot; rather than the &amp;quot;Open Software License&amp;quot;. You may distribute or
               communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0
               license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this
               Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative
               Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices
               so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to
               distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under
               the original OSL 3.0 license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Original Works licensed under this license shall reference &amp;quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0&amp;quot; in
               licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0
               license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;\n\n     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\&quot;Derivative Works\&quot;) based upon the Original Work;\n\n     c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d);\n\n     d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\n     e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \&quot;Source Code\&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor.

No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n5) External Deployment. The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n6) Attribution Rights.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \&quot;fair use\&quot; or \&quot;fair dealing\&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys&#39; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License. \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \&quot;You\&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \&quot;Modified License\&quot;) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \&quot;Open Software License\&quot; or \&quot;OSL\&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \&quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;\&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.\n\n17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (\&quot;OSL 3.0\&quot;) is \&quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:\n\n     (a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.\n\n     (b) The first sentence of Section 7 [\&quot;Warranty of Provenance\&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.\n\n     (c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [\&quot;Limitation of Liability\&quot;] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes \&quot;direct\&quot; damages.\n\n     (d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this \&quot;Non-Profit Open Software License\&quot; rather than the \&quot;Open Software License\&quot;. You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.\n\n     (e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference \&quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0\&quot; in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.\n&quot;,

Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source\n             Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\n             Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of\n             the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and\n             convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original\n             Work.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Exclusions From License Grant.

Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to\n             Licensor&amp;apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual\n             property.

Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from\n             licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise\n             would have a right to license.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5)&lt;/var&gt;\n          External Deployment.

If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent\n             indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and\n             conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,\n             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of\n             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the\n             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the\n             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by\n             copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect\n             copyright exceptions and limitations (including &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair\n             dealing&amp;quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of\n             the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section\n             1(c).\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\n             exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an\n             action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging\n             that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\n             action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software\n             or hardware.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought\n             only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor\n             conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its\n             conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n             the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside\n             the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and\n             penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall\n             survive the termination of this License.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Attorneys&amp;apos; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages\n             relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,\n             including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and costs incurred in\n             connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive\n             the termination of this License.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall\n             be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definition of &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; in This License. &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; throughout this License, whether\n             in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and\n             complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; includes\n             any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes\n             of this definition, &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n             direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of\n             fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\n             entity.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned\n             by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for\n             such uses by You.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 16)&lt;/var&gt;\n          Modification of This License.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\n\nThis Non-Profit Open Software License (\&quot;Non-Profit OSL\&quot;) version 3.0 (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the \&quot;Original Work\&quot;) whose owner (the \&quot;Licensor\&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:\n\n     Licensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0\n\n1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;\n\n     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\&quot;Derivative Works\&quot;) based upon the Original Work;\n\n     c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d);\n\n     d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\n     e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \&quot;Source Code\&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n5) External Deployment. The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \&quot;Attribution Notice.\&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \&quot;fair use\&quot; or \&quot;fair dealing\&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys&#39; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License. \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \&quot;You\&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \&quot;Modified License\&quot;) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \&quot;Open Software License\&quot; or \&quot;OSL\&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \&quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;\&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.\n\n17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (\&quot;OSL 3.0\&quot;) is \&quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:\n\n     (a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.\n\n     (b) The first sentence of Section 7 [\&quot;Warranty of Provenance\&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.\n\n     (c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [\&quot;Limitation of Liability\&quot;] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes \&quot;direct\&quot; damages.\n\n     (d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this \&quot;Non-Profit Open Software License\&quot; rather than the \&quot;Open Software License\&quot;. You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.\n\n     (e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference \&quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0\&quot; in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.\n&quot;,

If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,\n             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of\n             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the\n             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the\n             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by\n             copyright law and international treaty.

This Non-Profit Open Software License (&quot;Non-Profit OSL&quot;) version 3.0 (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;

b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work;

c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d);

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or &quot;fair dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys&#39; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the &quot;Open Software License&quot; or &quot;OSL&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (&quot;OSL 3.0&quot;) is &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:

(a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.

(b) The first sentence of Section 7 [&quot;Warranty of Provenance&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

(c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [&quot;Limitation of Liability&quot;] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes &quot;direct&quot; damages.

(d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License&quot; rather than the &quot;Open Software License&quot;. You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.

(e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference &quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0&quot; in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (\&quot;OSL 3.0\&quot;) is \&quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:\n\n(a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.\n\n(b) The first sentence of Section 7 [\&quot;Warranty of Provenance\&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken.

You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating.

For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

   16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the &quot;Open Software License&quot; or &quot;OSL&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

   17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (&quot;OSL 3.0&quot;) is &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0&quot;. The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:

      (a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.

      (b) The first sentence of Section 7 [&quot;Warranty of Provenance&quot;] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

      (c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [&quot;Limitation of Liability&quot;] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes &quot;direct&quot; damages.

      (d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License&quot; rather than the &quot;Open Software License&quot;. You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.

      (e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference &quot;Non-Profit OSL 3.0&quot; in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\n\nThis Non-Profit Open Software License (\&quot;Non-Profit OSL\&quot;) version 3.0 (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the \&quot;Original Work\&quot;) whose owner (the \&quot;Licensor\&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:\n\nLicensed under the Non-Profit Open Software License version 3.0\n\n   1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n      a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;\n\n      b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\&quot;Derivative Works\&quot;) based upon the Original Work;\n\n      c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d);\n\n      d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\n      e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n   2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n   3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \&quot;Source Code\&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n   4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n   5) External Deployment. The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n   6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \&quot;Attribution Notice.\&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n   7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n   8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n   9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \&quot;fair use\&quot; or \&quot;fair dealing\&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n   10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n   11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n   12) Attorneys&#39; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n   13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n   14) Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License. \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
