                 exceed the total costs of postage, storage medium and handling fees:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;
              It is required to also Redistribute means to enable recipients of the Derived Program to
                 replace the Derived Program with the Licensed Program first released under this License
                 (the &amp;quot;Original Program&amp;quot;). Such means may be to provide a difference file from

                 with the Original Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (5)&lt;/var&gt;
              Any material to be made available online or by means of mailing a medium to satisfy the

Such means may be to provide a difference file from the Original Program, or instructions setting out a method to replace the Derived Program with the Original Program.\n\n     (3) The Recipient must license the Derived Program under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n     (4) No one may use or include the name of the Licensed Program as a program name, font name or file name of the Derived Program.\n\n     (5) Any material to be made available online or by means of mailing a medium to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph may be provided, verbatim, by any party wishing to do so.\n\n2.
