    1.2. Data Provider will not sue you or any Downstream Recipient for any claim arising out of the use, modification, or distribution of the Data provided you meet the terms of the O-UDA.

    1.3 This O-UDA does not restrict your use, modification, or distribution of any portions of the Data that are in the public domain or that may be used, modified, or distributed under any other legal exception or limitation.

2. No Restrictions on Use or Results

      3.1.2. Your terms include a warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability for Upstream Data Providers at least as broad as those contained in Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the O-UDA.

4. No Warranty, Limitation of Liability

    4.1. Data Provider does not represent or warrant that it has any rights whatsoever in the Data.

    4.2. THE DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
