 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

     b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

     c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

     d. &quot;License Elements&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

     e. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

     f. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

     g. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

     h. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

     i. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.

     j. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;

     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            &amp;quot;Adaptation&amp;quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
               pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of
               music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
               includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
               transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original,
               except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
               the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
               performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
               image (&amp;quot;synching&amp;quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
               License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            &amp;quot;Collection&amp;quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
               encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works
               or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the
               selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which
               the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
               contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
               together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
               not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this
               License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and

            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
             worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
             copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
               the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
               translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
               identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
               marked &amp;quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&amp;quot; or a
               modification could indicate &amp;quot;The original work has been modified.&amp;quot;;
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
            &lt;p&gt;The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
               devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically
               necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
               rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to
               the rights described in Section 4(e).&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
             the following restrictions:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You
               must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with
               every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
               terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient
               of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
               License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
               this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
               Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
               not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
               recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
               terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
               Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
               subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
               required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
               required by Section 4(d), as requested.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
               License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
               License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
               version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
               Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&amp;quot;Applicable License&amp;quot;). You must
               include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
               You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
               Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the
               recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
               terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
               Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
               included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
               Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures
               on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
               exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
               This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
               not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the
               terms of the Applicable License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
               is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
               compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
               file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
               commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
               monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
               unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
               name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
               Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
               institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&amp;quot;Attribution Parties&amp;quot;)
               in Licensor&amp;apos;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
               name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
               reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
               Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
               the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
               identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &amp;quot;French translation of the
               Work by Original Author,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original
               Author&amp;quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any
               reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
               minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
               Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
               as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
               doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
               in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
               implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
               by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or
               Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the
               Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                 You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a
                 purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
                 and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
                 compulsory licensing scheme; and,
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iii.&lt;/var&gt;
              Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether
                 individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society
                 that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
                 You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
                 otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f.&lt;/var&gt;
            Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
               applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself
               or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
               take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
               Original Author&amp;apos;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
               (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
               (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
               modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&amp;apos;s honor
               and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
               the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
               exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
               otherwise.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
          &lt;p&gt;UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
             BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
             OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
             LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
             NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF
             ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
             OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
             LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
             PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
             LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by
               You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
               Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
               provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
               Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
               duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
               reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
               distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve
               to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
               granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
               effect unless terminated as stated above.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Miscellaneous
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to
               the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
               granted to You under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
               a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
               You under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
               not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
               and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
               reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
               such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
               waiver or consent.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e.&lt;/var&gt;
            This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work
               licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
               the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
               may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
               mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f.&lt;/var&gt;
            The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted
               utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
               Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
               Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the
               Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
               matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
               be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those
               treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
               under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License,
               such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
               intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

         Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.

    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or

    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer

    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work

    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 h. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 i. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a
    modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(d), as requested.
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;).
    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
    the exchange of copyrighted works.
 d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by
    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of
        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a
        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
        under Section 4(c).
 f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

      a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

      f. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

      g. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

      j. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;

      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).

   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

      c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

      d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

      f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

     b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

     c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;

     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

            &amp;quot;Adaptation&amp;quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other

               music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
               includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
               transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original,
               except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
               the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
               performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
               image (&amp;quot;synching&amp;quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this

               selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which
               the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
               contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
               together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
               not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

               identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
               marked &amp;quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&amp;quot; or a
               modification could indicate &amp;quot;The original work has been modified.&amp;quot;;

            &lt;p&gt;The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
               devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically
               necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
               rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to
               the rights described in Section 4(e).&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
             the following restrictions:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You
               must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with
               every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
               terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient
               of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
               License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
               this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
               Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
               not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
               recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
               terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
               Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
               subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
               required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
               required by Section 4(d), as requested.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
               License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
               License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
               version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
               Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&amp;quot;Applicable License&amp;quot;). You must
               include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
               You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
               Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the
               recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
               terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
               Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
               included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
               Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures
               on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
               exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
               This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
               not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the
               terms of the Applicable License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
               is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
               compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
               file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
               commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
               monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
               unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
               name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
               Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
               institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&amp;quot;Attribution Parties&amp;quot;)
               in Licensor&amp;apos;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
               name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
               reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
               Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
               the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
               identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &amp;quot;French translation of the
               Work by Original Author,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original
               Author&amp;quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any
               reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
               minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
               Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
               as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
               doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
               in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
               implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
               by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or
               Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the
               Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e.&lt;/var&gt;
            For the avoidance of doubt:

              Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
                 collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
                 waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
                 exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; ii.&lt;/var&gt;
              Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
                 royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
                 Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
                 You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a
                 purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
                 and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
                 compulsory licensing scheme; and,
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iii.&lt;/var&gt;
              Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether
                 individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society
                 that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
                 You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
                 otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f.&lt;/var&gt;
            Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
               applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself
               or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
               take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
               Original Author&amp;apos;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
               (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
               (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
               modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&amp;apos;s honor
               and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
               the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
               exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
               otherwise.
          &lt;/li&gt;

          Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
          &lt;p&gt;UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
             BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
             OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
             LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
             NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF
             ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
             OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

          Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
             LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
             PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
             LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by
               You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
               Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
               provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
               Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
               duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
               reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
               distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve
               to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
               granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
               effect unless terminated as stated above.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to
               the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
               granted to You under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
               a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
               You under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
               not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
               and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
               reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
               such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
               waiver or consent.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e.&lt;/var&gt;
            This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work
               licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
               the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
               may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
               mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f.&lt;/var&gt;
            The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted
               utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
               Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
               Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the
               Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
               matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
               be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those
               treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
               under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License,
               such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
               intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

         Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \&quot;AS-IS\&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n\nLicense\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\&quot;CCPL\&quot; OR \&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n     a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n     b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n     d. \&quot;License Elements\&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n     e. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n     f. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n     g. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n     h. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n     i. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n     j. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n\n     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n     b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n     d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n     e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n     f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

You\n               must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with\n               every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any\n               terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient\n               of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the\n               License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n               this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n               Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may\n               not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n               recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n               terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n               Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made\n               subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any\n               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\n               required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n               Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\n               required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this\n               License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this\n               License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license\n               version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n               Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&amp;quot;Applicable License&amp;quot;). You must\n               include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation\n               You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\n               Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the\n               recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n               terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\n               Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as\n               included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or\n               Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures\n               on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to\n               exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\n               This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\n               not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the\n               terms of the Applicable License.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that\n               is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\n               compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\n               file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward\n               commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any\n               monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;\n            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,\n               unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices\n               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n               name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n               Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\n               institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&amp;quot;Attribution Parties&amp;quot;)\n               in Licensor&amp;apos;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the\n               name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent\n               reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the\n               Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for\n               the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\n               identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &amp;quot;French translation of the\n               Work by Original Author,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n               Author&amp;quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\n               reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\n               minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n               Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least\n               as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of\n               doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n               in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not\n               implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement\n               by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or\n               Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the\n               Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e.&lt;/var&gt;\n            For the avoidance of doubt:\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; i.&lt;/var&gt;\n              Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n\nLicense\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\&quot;CCPL\&quot; OR \&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n     a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n     b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n     d. \&quot;License Elements\&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n     e. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n     f. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n     g. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n     h. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n     i. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n     j. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n\n     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n     b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n     d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n     e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n     f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).

You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n               this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n               Distribute or Publicly Perform.

You must\n               include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation\n               You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\n               Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the\n               recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n               terms of the Applicable License.

When You Distribute or\n               Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures\n               on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to\n               exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\n               This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\n               not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the\n               terms of the Applicable License.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that\n               is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\n               compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\n               file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward\n               commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any\n               monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;\n            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,\n               unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices\n               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n               name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n               Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\n               institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&amp;quot;Attribution Parties&amp;quot;)\n               in Licensor&amp;apos;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the\n               name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent\n               reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the\n               Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for\n               the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\n               identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &amp;quot;French translation of the\n               Work by Original Author,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n               Author&amp;quot;).

If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;i.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;ii.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;iii.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
 c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.

    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
 g. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 h. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 i. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 j. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a
    modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(d), as requested.
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;).
    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
    the exchange of copyrighted works.
 d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by
    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of
        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a
        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
        under Section 4(c).
 f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

Definitions\n\n a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole.

Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\nlimit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\nlimitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\ncopyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The\n    original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a\n    modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n    in Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\nother media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\ngranted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the\nrights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(d), as requested.\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)\n    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;).\n    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You\n    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the\n    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the\n    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this\n    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be\n    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with\n    the exchange of copyrighted works.\n d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by\n    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\n        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\n        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\n        under Section 4(c).\n f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS\nAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE\nWORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(d), as requested.\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)\n    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;).\n    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You\n    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the\n    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the\n    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this\n    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be\n    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with\n    the exchange of copyrighted works.\n d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by\n    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\n        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\n        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\n        under Section 4(c).\n f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS\nAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE\nWORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

      a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

      b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

      f. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

      g. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

      h. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

      i. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.

      j. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;

      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).

   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

      c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

      d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

      f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n   1. Definitions\n\n      a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n      b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n      c. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n      d. \&quot;License Elements\&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n      e. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n      f. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n      g. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n      h. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n      i. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n      j. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n      c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n      d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n      f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7. Termination\n\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n   8. Miscellaneous\n\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n      c. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n      d. \&quot;License Elements\&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n      e. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n      f. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n      g. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n      h. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n      i. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n      j. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n      c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n      d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n      f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7. Termination\n\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n   8. Miscellaneous\n\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\nc. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\nd. \&quot;License Elements\&quot; means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\ne. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\nf. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\ng. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\nh. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\ni. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\nj. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\na. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\nb. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n\nc. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\nd. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\nb. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\nc. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\nd. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\ne. For the avoidance of doubt:\ni. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\nii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\nf. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\nb. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nf. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.
