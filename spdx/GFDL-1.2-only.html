Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

        GNU Free Documentation License&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 1.2, November 2002
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation,
      Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        PREAMBLE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
          other functional and useful document &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; in the sense of
          freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
          redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
          or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
          author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
          not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This License is a kind of &amp;quot;copyleft&amp;quot;, which means that
          derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
          the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
          which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
          free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
          program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
          software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
          it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
          whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
          principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
          that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
          it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
          notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
          duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
          The &amp;quot;Document&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
          Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
          &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute
          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; of the Document means any work containing
          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
          with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Secondary Section&amp;quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
          Document&amp;apos;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Invariant Sections&amp;quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose
          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
          in the notice that says that the Document is released under
          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Cover Texts&amp;quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
          amount of text. A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read
          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML
          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title
          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the
          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
          which states that this License applies to the Document. These
          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may
          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        VERBATIM COPYING
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions
          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        COPYING IN QUANTITY
        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the required texts for either cover are too
          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
          network-using public has access to download using public-standard
          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,
          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is requested, but not required, that you contact
          the authors of the Document well before redistributing
          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
          provide you with an updated version of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        MODIFICATIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
          of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; A.&lt;/var&gt;
            Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
            from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
            (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
            of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
            if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; B.&lt;/var&gt;
            List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
            entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
            Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
            authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
            fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; C.&lt;/var&gt;
            State on the Title page the name of the publisher
            of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; D.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; E.&lt;/var&gt;
            Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
            modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; F.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
            giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
            terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; G.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
            and required Cover Texts given in the Document&amp;apos;s license notice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; H.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include an unaltered copy of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; I.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, Preserve its Title, and
            add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
            and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
            Page. If there is no section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the Document,
            create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
            of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
            describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; J.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
            for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
            likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
            versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;
            section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
            published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
            original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; K.&lt;/var&gt;
            For any section Entitled &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;,
            Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
            section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
            acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; L.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
            in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
            equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; M.&lt;/var&gt;
            Delete any section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;. Such a
            section may not be included in the Modified Version.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; N.&lt;/var&gt;
            Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;
            or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; O.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
          appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
          copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
          all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles
          to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&amp;apos;s license
          notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, provided
          it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified
          Version by various parties--for example, statements of
          peer review or that the text has been approved by an
          organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
          and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
          the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
          of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
          through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
          includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
          by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
          you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
          permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
          License give permission to use their names for publicity for
          or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        COMBINING DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may combine the Document with other documents released under
          this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
          versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
          Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,
          and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
          license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
          multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
          copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section
          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.
          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
          other documents released under this License, and replace the
          individual copies of this License in the various documents
          with a single copy that is included in the collection,
          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may extract a single document from such a collection,
          and distribute it individually under this License,
          provided you insert a copy of this License into the
          extracted document, and follow this License in all other
          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;
          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what
          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover
          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document
          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        TRANSLATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
          include the original English version of this License and the original
          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
          between the translation and the original version of this License
          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If a section in the Document is Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the
          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
          1) will typically require changing the actual title.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        TERMINATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
          except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
          attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
          is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
          this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
          rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
          versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time
          to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
          the present version, but may differ in detail to address
          new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
          If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
          License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it, you have the option
          of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
          version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
          draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
          specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
          ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To use this License in a document you have written, include
        a copy of the License in the document and put the following
        copyright and license notices just after the title page:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
        distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
        Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published
        by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
        Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
        included in the section entitled &amp;quot;GNU Free Documentation License&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
        Back-Cover Texts, replace the &amp;quot;with...Texts.&amp;quot; line with this:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
        or some other combination of the three, merge
        those two alternatives to suit the situation.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
        code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
        under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
        General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

                  Version 1.2, November 2002
 

 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 

0. PREAMBLE
 
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
 
This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
 
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
 
A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
 
A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
 
The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
 
The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 
A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.
 
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
 
The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 
A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.
 
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
 

2. VERBATIM COPYING
 
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
 

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
 
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
 
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
 
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 

4. MODIFICATIONS
 
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
 
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 
You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
 
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.
 

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
 
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
 

8. TRANSLATION
 
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 
If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
 

9. TERMINATION
 
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
 

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
 
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
    Free Documentation License&quot;.
 
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:
 
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
 
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
 
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>GNU Free Documentation License

Version 1.2, November 2002

Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

   A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

   The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

   2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

      A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

      B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

      C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.

      D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.

      F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.

      H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

      J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

      K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

      L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

      M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.

      N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

      O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

   9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.</pre></details></li></ul><h1>by Source</h1><ul><li><h3><a href="/source/SPDX">SPDX</a>: <a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e">SPDXLicense:12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e</a> for <a href="/?license=spdx:GFDL-1.2-only"><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>GFDL-1.2-only</span></a></h3><div class="two-columns-grid"><div><h2>LicenseNames</h2><ul><li><b>this:</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>GFDL-1.2-only</span></li></ul></li><li><b>other LicenseNames (1):</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename">GNU Free Documentation License v1.2 only</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2>License Ratings</h2><ul><li><span title="">FSF: <b style="color: green;">Libre</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li><li><span title="">OSI: <b style="color: red;">Rejected</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/12717751ff019bad80d20e6f7fb3164e">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li></ul><h2>License Comments</h2><ul><li><b>SPDXLicense: </b>This license was released November 2002.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

        Version 1.2, November 2002
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation,
      Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        PREAMBLE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
          other functional and useful document &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; in the sense of
          freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
          redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
          or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
          author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
          not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This License is a kind of &amp;quot;copyleft&amp;quot;, which means that
          derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
          the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
          which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
          free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
          program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
          software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
          it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
          whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
          principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
          that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
          it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
          notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
          duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
          The &amp;quot;Document&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
          Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
          &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute
          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; of the Document means any work containing
          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
          with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Secondary Section&amp;quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
          Document&amp;apos;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Invariant Sections&amp;quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose
          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
          in the notice that says that the Document is released under
          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Cover Texts&amp;quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
          amount of text. A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read
          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML
          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title
          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the
          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
          which states that this License applies to the Document. These
          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may
          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        VERBATIM COPYING
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions
          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        COPYING IN QUANTITY
        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the required texts for either cover are too
          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
          network-using public has access to download using public-standard
          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,
          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is requested, but not required, that you contact
          the authors of the Document well before redistributing
          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
          provide you with an updated version of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        MODIFICATIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
          of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; A.&lt;/var&gt;
            Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
            from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
            (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
            of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
            if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; B.&lt;/var&gt;
            List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
            entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
            Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
            authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
            fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; C.&lt;/var&gt;
            State on the Title page the name of the publisher
            of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; D.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; E.&lt;/var&gt;
            Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
            modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; F.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
            giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
            terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; G.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
            and required Cover Texts given in the Document&amp;apos;s license notice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; H.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include an unaltered copy of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; I.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, Preserve its Title, and
            add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
            and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
            Page. If there is no section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the Document,
            create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
            of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
            describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; J.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
            for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
            likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
            versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;
            section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
            published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
            original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; K.&lt;/var&gt;
            For any section Entitled &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;,
            Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
            section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
            acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; L.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
            in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
            equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; M.&lt;/var&gt;
            Delete any section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;. Such a
            section may not be included in the Modified Version.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; N.&lt;/var&gt;
            Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;
            or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; O.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
          appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
          copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
          all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles
          to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&amp;apos;s license
          notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, provided
          it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified
          Version by various parties--for example, statements of
          peer review or that the text has been approved by an
          organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
          and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
          the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
          of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
          through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
          includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
          by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
          you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
          permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
          License give permission to use their names for publicity for
          or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        COMBINING DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may combine the Document with other documents released under
          this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
          versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
          Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,
          and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
          license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
          multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
          copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section
          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.
          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
          other documents released under this License, and replace the
          individual copies of this License in the various documents
          with a single copy that is included in the collection,
          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may extract a single document from such a collection,
          and distribute it individually under this License,
          provided you insert a copy of this License into the
          extracted document, and follow this License in all other
          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;
          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what
          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover
          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document
          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        TRANSLATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
          include the original English version of this License and the original
          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
          between the translation and the original version of this License
          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If a section in the Document is Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the
          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
          1) will typically require changing the actual title.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        TERMINATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
          except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
          attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
          is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
          this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
          rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
          versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time
          to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
          the present version, but may differ in detail to address
          new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
          If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
          License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it, you have the option
          of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
          version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
          draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
          specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
          ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To use this License in a document you have written, include
        a copy of the License in the document and put the following
        copyright and license notices just after the title page:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
        distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
        Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published
        by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
        Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
        included in the section entitled &amp;quot;GNU Free Documentation License&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
        Back-Cover Texts, replace the &amp;quot;with...Texts.&amp;quot; line with this:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
        or some other combination of the three, merge
        those two alternatives to suit the situation.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
        code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
        under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
        General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
      &lt;/p&gt;

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n     I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n     K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n     M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\n with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n&quot;,

If you distribute a large enough\n          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions\n          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COPYING IN QUANTITY\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,\n          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\n          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly\n          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The\n          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\n          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\n          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the required texts for either cover are too\n          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first\n          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n          network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\n          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take\n          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\n          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          It is requested, but not required, that you contact\n          the authors of the Document well before redistributing\n          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to\n          provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n        MODIFICATIONS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n          of it.

These may be placed in the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;\n            section. You may omit a network location for a work that was\n            published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the\n            original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; K.&lt;/var&gt;\n            For any section Entitled &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;,\n            Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the\n            section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor\n            acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; L.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered\n            in their text and in their titles.

To do this, add their titles\n          to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&amp;apos;s license\n          notice.

If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\n          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\n          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique\n          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list\n          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section\n          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.\n          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and\n          other documents released under this License, and replace the\n          individual copies of this License in the various documents\n          with a single copy that is included in the collection,\n          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may extract a single document from such a collection,\n          and distribute it individually under this License,\n          provided you insert a copy of this License into the\n          extracted document, and follow this License in all other\n          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume\n          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;\n          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to\n          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what\n          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an\n          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to\n          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less\n          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover\n          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document\n          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers\n          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\n          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n        TRANSLATION\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section\n          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a\n          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also\n          include the original English version of this License and the original\n          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement\n          between the translation and the original version of this License\n          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If a section in the Document is Entitled\n          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the\n          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section\n          1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n        TERMINATION\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n          except as expressly provided for under this License.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;GNU Free Documentation License\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n     I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n     K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n     M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\n with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n&quot;,

For\n          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title\n          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\n          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose\n          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for\n          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the\n          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that\n          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n          which states that this License applies to the Document. These\n          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\n          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:\n          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may\n          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n        VERBATIM COPYING\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\n          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not\n          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\n          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\n          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions\n          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COPYING IN QUANTITY\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,\n          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\n          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly\n          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The\n          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\n          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\n          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the required texts for either cover are too\n          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first\n          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n          network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\n          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take\n          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\n          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          It is requested, but not required, that you contact\n          the authors of the Document well before redistributing\n          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to\n          provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n        MODIFICATIONS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n          of it.

If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\n          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\n          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique\n          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list\n          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section\n          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.\n          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and\n          other documents released under this License, and replace the\n          individual copies of this License in the various documents\n          with a single copy that is included in the collection,\n          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may extract a single document from such a collection,\n          and distribute it individually under this License,\n          provided you insert a copy of this License into the\n          extracted document, and follow this License in all other\n          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume\n          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;\n          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to\n          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what\n          the individual works permit.

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\n   The \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n   A \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\n   The \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n   A section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; VERBATIM COPYING\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; MODIFICATIONS\n\n   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;A.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;B.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;C.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;D.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;E.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;F.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;G.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;H.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;I.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;J.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;K.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;L.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;M.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;N.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;O.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; TRANSLATION\n\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; TERMINATION\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

      Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation,
      Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        PREAMBLE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
          other functional and useful document &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; in the sense of
          freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
          redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
          or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
          author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
          not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This License is a kind of &amp;quot;copyleft&amp;quot;, which means that
          derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
          the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
          which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
          free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
          program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
          software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
          it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
          whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
          principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
          that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
          it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
          notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
          duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
          The &amp;quot;Document&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
          Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
          &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute
          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; of the Document means any work containing
          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
          with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Secondary Section&amp;quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
          Document&amp;apos;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Invariant Sections&amp;quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose
          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
          in the notice that says that the Document is released under
          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Cover Texts&amp;quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
          amount of text. A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read
          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML
          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title
          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the
          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
          which states that this License applies to the Document. These
          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may
          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        VERBATIM COPYING
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions
          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        COPYING IN QUANTITY
        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the required texts for either cover are too
          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
          network-using public has access to download using public-standard
          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,
          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is requested, but not required, that you contact
          the authors of the Document well before redistributing
          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
          provide you with an updated version of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        MODIFICATIONS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
          of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; A.&lt;/var&gt;
            Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
            from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
            (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
            of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
            if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; B.&lt;/var&gt;
            List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
            entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
            Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
            authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
            fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; C.&lt;/var&gt;
            State on the Title page the name of the publisher
            of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; D.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; E.&lt;/var&gt;
            Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
            modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; F.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
            giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
            terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; G.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
            and required Cover Texts given in the Document&amp;apos;s license notice.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; H.&lt;/var&gt;
            Include an unaltered copy of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; I.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, Preserve its Title, and
            add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
            and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
            Page. If there is no section Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the Document,
            create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
            of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
            describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; J.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
            for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
            likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
            versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;
            section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
            published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
            original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; K.&lt;/var&gt;
            For any section Entitled &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;,
            Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
            section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
            acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; L.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
            in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
            equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; M.&lt;/var&gt;
            Delete any section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;. Such a
            section may not be included in the Modified Version.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; N.&lt;/var&gt;
            Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;
            or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; O.&lt;/var&gt;
            Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
          appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
          copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
          all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles
          to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&amp;apos;s license
          notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a section Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, provided
          it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified
          Version by various parties--for example, statements of
          peer review or that the text has been approved by an
          organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
          and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
          the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
          of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
          through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
          includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
          by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
          you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
          permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
          License give permission to use their names for publicity for
          or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        COMBINING DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may combine the Document with other documents released under
          this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
          versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
          Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,
          and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
          license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
          multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
          copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section
          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.
          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
          other documents released under this License, and replace the
          individual copies of this License in the various documents
          with a single copy that is included in the collection,
          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may extract a single document from such a collection,
          and distribute it individually under this License,
          provided you insert a copy of this License into the
          extracted document, and follow this License in all other
          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;
          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what
          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover
          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document
          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        TRANSLATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
          include the original English version of this License and the original
          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
          between the translation and the original version of this License
          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If a section in the Document is Entitled
          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the
          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
          1) will typically require changing the actual title.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        TERMINATION
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
          except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
          attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
          is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
          this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
          rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
          versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time
          to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
          the present version, but may differ in detail to address
          new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
          If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
          License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it, you have the option
          of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
          version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
          draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
          specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
          ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To use this License in a document you have written, include
        a copy of the License in the document and put the following
        copyright and license notices just after the title page:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
        distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
        Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published
        by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
        Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
        included in the section entitled &amp;quot;GNU Free Documentation License&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
        Back-Cover Texts, replace the &amp;quot;with...Texts.&amp;quot; line with this:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
        or some other combination of the three, merge
        those two alternatives to suit the situation.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
        code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
        under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
        General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;GNU Free Documentation License\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n     I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n     K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n     M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\n with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n&quot;,

A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,\n          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\n          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.\n          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.\n          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read\n          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML\n          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally\n          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF\n          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\n          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For\n          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title\n          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\n          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose\n          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for\n          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the\n          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that\n          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n          which states that this License applies to the Document.

You may not\n          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\n          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\n          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions\n          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COPYING IN QUANTITY\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,\n          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\n          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly\n          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The\n          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\n          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\n          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the required texts for either cover are too\n          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first\n          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n          network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\n          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take\n          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\n          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          It is requested, but not required, that you contact\n          the authors of the Document well before redistributing\n          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to\n          provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n        MODIFICATIONS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n          of it.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;GNU Free Documentation License\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n     I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n     K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n     M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\n with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n&quot;,

You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\n          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A &amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; of the Document means any work containing\n          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or\n          with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A &amp;quot;Secondary Section&amp;quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter\n          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the\n          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the\n          Document&amp;apos;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\n          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.\n          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\n          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The\n          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with\n          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\n          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The &amp;quot;Invariant Sections&amp;quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose\n          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,\n          in the notice that says that the Document is released under\n          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of\n          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.\n          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The &amp;quot;Cover Texts&amp;quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may\n          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable\n          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available\n          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document\n          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\n          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial\n          amount of text. A copy that is not &amp;quot;Transparent&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Opaque&amp;quot;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,\n          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\n          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.\n          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.\n          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read\n          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML\n          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally\n          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF\n          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The &amp;quot;Title Page&amp;quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\n          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For\n          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &amp;quot;Title\n          Page&amp;quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\n          work&amp;apos;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose\n          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for\n          a specific section name mentioned below, such as &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;.) To &amp;quot;Preserve the\n          Title&amp;quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that\n          it remains a section &amp;quot;Entitled XYZ&amp;quot; according to this definition.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n          which states that this License applies to the Document. These\n          Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\n          in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:\n          any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may\n          have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n        VERBATIM COPYING\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n          commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n          copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n          to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\n          other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not\n          use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n          copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\n          compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\n          number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may also lend copies, under the same conditions\n          stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COPYING IN QUANTITY\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n          have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,\n          and the Document&amp;apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n          enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\n          all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n          Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly\n          and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The\n          front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\n          equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\n          covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the required texts for either cover are too\n          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first\n          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n          network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\n          free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take\n          reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n          copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n          remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n          year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\n          or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          It is requested, but not required, that you contact\n          the authors of the Document well before redistributing\n          any large number of copies, to give them a chance to\n          provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n        MODIFICATIONS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n          the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n          the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n          Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n          and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n          of it.

If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\n          but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\n          by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n          author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique\n          number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list\n          of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; in the various original documents, forming one section\n          Entitled &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, and any sections Entitled &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;.\n          You must delete all sections Entitled &amp;quot;Endorsements&amp;quot;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n        COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may make a collection consisting of the Document and\n          other documents released under this License, and replace the\n          individual copies of this License in the various documents\n          with a single copy that is included in the collection,\n          provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n          copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may extract a single document from such a collection,\n          and distribute it individually under this License,\n          provided you insert a copy of this License into the\n          extracted document, and follow this License in all other\n          respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n        AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n          separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume\n          of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot;\n          if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to\n          limit the legal rights of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what\n          the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an\n          aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n          aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to\n          these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less\n          than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&amp;apos;s Cover\n          Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document\n          within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers\n          if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\n          appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n        TRANSLATION\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n          distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section\n          4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n          permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n          translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n          original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a\n          translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n          Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also\n          include the original English version of this License and the original\n          versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement\n          between the translation and the original version of this License\n          or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          If a section in the Document is Entitled\n          &amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dedications&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;History&amp;quot;, the\n          requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section\n          1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n        TERMINATION\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n          except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other\n          attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document\n          is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n          this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\n          rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n        FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised\n          versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time\n          to time.

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\n   The \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n   A \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\n   The \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n   A section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; VERBATIM COPYING\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; MODIFICATIONS\n\n   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;A.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;B.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;C.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;D.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;E.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;F.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;G.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;H.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;I.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;J.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;K.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;L.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;M.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;N.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;O.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; TRANSLATION\n\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; TERMINATION\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

                  Version 1.2, November 2002
 

 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 

0. PREAMBLE
 
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
 
This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
 
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
 
A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
 
A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
 
The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
 
The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 
A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.
 
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
 
The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 
A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.
 
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
 

2. VERBATIM COPYING
 
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
 

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
 
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
 
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
 
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 

4. MODIFICATIONS
 
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
 
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 
You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
 
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.
 

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
 
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
 

8. TRANSLATION
 
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 
If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
 

9. TERMINATION
 
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
 

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
 
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
    Free Documentation License&quot;.
 
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:
 
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
 
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
 
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;                GNU Free Documentation License\n                  Version 1.2, November 2002\n \n\n Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n \n\n0. PREAMBLE\n \nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n \nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n \nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n \n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n \nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n \nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n \nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n \nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n \nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n \nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n \nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n \nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n \nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\n\&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.)  To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot;\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n \nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n \n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n \nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n \nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n \n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n \nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n \nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n \nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n \nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n \n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n \nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n \nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;,\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n \nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n \nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n \nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n \nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n \n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n \nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n \nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n \nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\nand any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;.  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n \n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n \nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n \nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n \n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n \nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n \nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n \n\n8. TRANSLATION\n \nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n \nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\n\&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n \n\n9. TERMINATION\n \nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n \n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n \nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n \nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n \nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n \n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU\n    Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n \nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n \n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n \nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n \nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.&quot;,

PREAMBLE\n \nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n \nThis License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n \nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n \n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n \nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n \nA \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n \nA \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n \nThe \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n \nThe \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n \nA \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n \nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n \nThe \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n \nA section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\n\&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.)  To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot;\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n \nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n \n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n \nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n \nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n \n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n \nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n \nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n \nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n \nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n \n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n \nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n \nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;,\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n \nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n \nYou may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n \nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n \nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n \n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n \nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n \nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n \nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\nand any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;.  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n \n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n \nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n \nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n \n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n \nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n \nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n \n\n8. TRANSLATION\n \nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n \nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;,\n\&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n \n\n9. TERMINATION\n \nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n \n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n \nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n \nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n \nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n \n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU\n    Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n \nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n \n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n \nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n \nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.&quot;,

Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

   A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

   The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

   2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

   4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

      A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

      B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

      C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.

      D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

      E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.

      F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

      G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.

      H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

      I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

      J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

      K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

      L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

      M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.

      N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

      O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

   9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;GNU Free Documentation License\n\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n   0. PREAMBLE\n\n   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\n   The \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n   A \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\n   The \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n   A section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n   2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n   4. MODIFICATIONS\n\n   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n      A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n      B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n      C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n      D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n      E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n      F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n      G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n\n      H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n      I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n      J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n      K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\n      L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n      M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n      N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n      O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n   8. TRANSLATION\n\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n   9. TERMINATION\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.&quot;,

        &quot;_rf_text&quot;: &quot;GNU Free Documentation License\n\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n   0. PREAMBLE\n\n   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \&quot;free\&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \&quot;copyleft\&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \&quot;Document\&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A \&quot;Modified Version\&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \&quot;Secondary Section\&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \&quot;Invariant Sections\&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\n   The \&quot;Cover Texts\&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n   A \&quot;Transparent\&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \&quot;Transparent\&quot; is called \&quot;Opaque\&quot;.\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\n   The \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \&quot;Title Page\&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n   A section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;.) To \&quot;Preserve the Title\&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \&quot;Entitled XYZ\&quot; according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n   2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n   4. MODIFICATIONS\n\n   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n      A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n      B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n      C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n      D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n      E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n      F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n      G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s license notice.\n\n      H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n      I. Preserve the section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n      J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \&quot;History\&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n      K. For any section Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot; or \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\n      L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n      M. Delete any section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n      N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n      O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \&quot;History\&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \&quot;History\&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, and any sections Entitled \&quot;Dedications\&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled \&quot;Endorsements\&quot;.\n\n   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n   8. TRANSLATION\n\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled \&quot;Acknowledgements\&quot;, \&quot;Dedications\&quot;, or \&quot;History\&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n   9. TERMINATION\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \&quot;GNU Free Documentation License\&quot;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \&quot;with...Texts.\&quot; line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.&quot;,
