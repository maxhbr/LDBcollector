drafted a new license with updated contact information. The intention was
to have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the older licensing, but
because part of it was misread or accidentally ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE
v2.5+ Software License contained commercial use restrictions which made it
non-free. After this issue was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the
TORQUE upstream revised the license to remove the commercial use
restrictions in v1.1. The TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but
GPL incompatible because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that
this license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is
derived from OpenPBS&#39;&#39;s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is properly dual
licensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that this license is not
useful for other codebases without removing Note 1.

drafted a new license with updated contact information. The intention was
to have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the older licensing, but
because part of it was misread or accidentally ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE
v2.5+ Software License contained commercial use restrictions which made it
non-free. After this issue was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the
TORQUE upstream revised the license to remove the commercial use
restrictions in v1.1. The TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but
GPL incompatible because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that
this license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is
derived from OpenPBS&#39;&#39;s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is properly dual
licensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that this license is not
useful for other codebases without removing Note 1.
