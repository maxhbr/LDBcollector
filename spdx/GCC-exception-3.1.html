Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&quot;Exception&quot;) is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 (&quot;GPLv3&quot;). It applies to a given file (the &quot;Runtime Library&quot;) that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

&quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

&quot;GPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

&quot;Target Code&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

General information: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&quot;Exception&quot;) is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (&quot;GPLv3&quot;). It applies to a given file (the &quot;Runtime Library&quot;) that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

   0. Definitions.

   A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.

   &quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.

   &quot;GPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.

   &quot;Target Code&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

   The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

   A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.

   1. Grant of Additional Permission.

   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\n\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\n\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\&quot;Exception\&quot;) is an additional\npermission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\n3 (\&quot;GPLv3\&quot;). It applies to a given file (the \&quot;Runtime Library\&quot;) that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \&quot;Independent Module\&quot; if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\&quot;GCC\&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\&quot;GPL-compatible Software\&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\&quot;Target Code\&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \&quot;Compilation Process\&quot; transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \&quot;Eligible\&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.&quot;
