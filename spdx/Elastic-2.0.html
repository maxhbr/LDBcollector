        the software. If you or your company make any written claim that the software
        infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for
        the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes
        such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your
        company.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;## Notices&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you
        also gets a copy of these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you modify the software, you must include in any modified copies of the
        software prominent notices stating that you have modified the software.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;## No Other Rights&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        These terms do not imply any licenses other than those expressly granted in
        these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;## Termination&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is not licensed,
        and your licenses will automatically terminate. If the licensor provides you
        with a notice of your violation, and you cease all violation of this license no
        later than 30 days after you receive that notice, your licenses will be
        reinstated retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such
        reinstatement, any additional violation of these terms will cause your licenses
        to terminate automatically and permanently.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;## No Liability&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        *As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
        condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising
        out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of
        legal claim.*
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;## Definitions&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The **licensor** is the entity offering these terms, and the **software** is the
        software the licensor makes available under these terms, including any portion
        of it.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;**you** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        **your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of
        organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over,
        are under the control of, or are under common control with that
        organization. **control** means ownership of substantially all the assets of an
        entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or
        otherwise. Control can be direct or indirect.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        **your licenses** are all the licenses granted to you for the software under
        these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;**use** means anything you do with the software requiring one of your licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;**trademark** means trademarks, service marks, and similar rights.&lt;/p&gt;
