PREAMBLE

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.

b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.

c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.

d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

a. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.

b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software.

c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.

d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or

Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.

b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.

c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.

d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

5.0 Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

     5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.

6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.

     6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.

     6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.

     6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

          a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

          b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     6.4 Required Notices.

          a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

          b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.

     6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.

     7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.

     12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

     12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

     12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

13.0 Miscellaneous.

     13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth herein.

     13.2 Relationship of Parties.

     13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

     13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

     13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

     13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

     13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

     13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&#39;s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

     13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         &lt;p&gt;PREAMBLE&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License.
         However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent
         only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under
         the terms of this License to Licensor&amp;apos;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are
         required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code
         of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively
         defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License.
         In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for
         the benefit of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You may:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
          Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License
             either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from
             several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but
             the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
             liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&amp;apos;t work properly or causes You any
             injury or damages.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License,
             provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third
             parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all
             Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
          Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for
             Your customers.
        &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You may not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
          Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee
             not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and
             distribution involve physical media.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
          Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the

&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict
             the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form
             under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License
             automatically terminate.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
          Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change,
             the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in
             the Source Code and in a text file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and
             Your Extensions.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
          Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an
             Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and
             include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and
             instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.

          Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, have
             made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Software or portions thereof, but solely to the
             extent that any such claim is necessary to enable You to make, use, have made, and/or

             claims derived from the Licensed Software under this License, to do the following:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2&lt;/var&gt;
              Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, have
                 made, and/or otherwise dispose of Extensions or portions thereof, but solely to the extent

          Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to
             trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
             or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3
             and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may
             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its
             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
             to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that
             Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
      
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.1&lt;/var&gt;
          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the
             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances
             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the
             patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each
             Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
             infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any
             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your
             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses
         granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works,
         or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute
         are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any
         Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this
         License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to
         Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those
         intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,
         create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions
         You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or
         Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every
         copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any
         Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or
         restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

              Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source
                 Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as
                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its
                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain
                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the
                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                 third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in
                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and
                 distribution involve physical media.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You
                 contribute, to update the file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting
                 the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates
                 of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear
                 in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that
                 the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include
                 the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code
                 and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related
                 documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may
                 not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the
                 Licensed Software.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Intellectual Property Matters.
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&amp;apos;s intellectual property
                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; that describes the claim and the party making
                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such
                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall
                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take
                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
                     to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been
                     obtained.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&amp;quot;API&amp;quot;) and You
                     have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You
                     must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe
                     that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient
                     rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;

              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the
                 Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe
                 recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in
                 EXHIBIT A (the &amp;quot;Notice&amp;quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the
                 Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a
                 Contributor to the text file titled &amp;quot;CONTRIB&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along
                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a
                 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a
                 location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
                 notice.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially
                 Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification
                 the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and
                 instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire
                 updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised
                 instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify
                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,
                 mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index
                 them.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.5&lt;/var&gt;
              Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so
                 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make
                 it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by
                 the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 terms You offer.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being
                 Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another
                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your
                 Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict
                 with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
                 conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission
                 will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.0&lt;/var&gt;

          If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply
             it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your
             license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that
             Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may
             not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this
             License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You
             require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public

          Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
             (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
             DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
             PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
             INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE

             APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
             EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
             OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
             APPLY TO YOU.
        &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.0&lt;/var&gt;
      High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED,
         MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS
         ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES,
         AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT
         MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD
         DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&amp;quot;HIGH RISK
         ACTIVITIES&amp;quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY
         OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.
    &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for
         claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
         this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.
         This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
         Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
         use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties
         and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and
         Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms
         of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
         to constitute any admission of liability.
    &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the
         event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or
         restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or
         prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any
         use of Licensed Software.
      
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.1&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
             automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within
             thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software
             that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by
             their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.2&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a
             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to
             herein as &amp;quot;Respondent&amp;quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any
             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of
             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the
             &amp;quot;Notice Period&amp;quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed
             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty
             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and
             4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.3&lt;/var&gt;
          Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent
             alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim
             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under
             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
             or license.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.4&lt;/var&gt;
          No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user
             license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly
             granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
             termination.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Miscellaneous.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.1&lt;/var&gt;
          U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined
             in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;commercial
             computer software documentation,&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
             Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
             U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth
             herein.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.2&lt;/var&gt;
          Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
             joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any
             Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,
             appearance, or otherwise.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.3&lt;/var&gt;
          Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&amp;apos;s right to acquire,
             license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the
             same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop,
             produce, market, or distribute.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.4&lt;/var&gt;
          Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this
             License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.5&lt;/var&gt;
          Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
             hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
             reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.6&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any
             of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to
             statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the
             software.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.7&lt;/var&gt;
          Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring,
             exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by
             United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise
             obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all
             applicable laws and regulations.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.8&lt;/var&gt;
          Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp;amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions
             (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License
             shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American
             Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and
             grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving
             any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered
             and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&amp;apos;s
             fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary
             to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court
             of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&amp;apos;s
             fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
             International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights
             to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or
             regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
             drafter shall not apply to this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;

PREAMBLE 

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. 

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone. 

Under the terms of this License You may: 
a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee. 
b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages. 
c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software. 
d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers. 

Under the terms of this License You may not: 
a. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media. 
b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software. 
c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate. 
d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or 

Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License. 
Under the terms of this License You must: 
a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. 
b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download. 
c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates. 
d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

   Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

   6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.

      6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.

      6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.

      6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

         a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

         b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      6.4 Required Notices.

         a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

         b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.

      6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

   7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.

      7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

      12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.

b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.

c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.

d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

a. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.

b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software.

c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.

d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or

Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.

b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.

c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.

d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

     3.3 Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Software or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable You to make, use, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Software or portions thereof.

     3.4 Licensor reserves the right to release new versions of the Software with different features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, general availability or other characteristics.

5.0 Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

     5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.

6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.

     6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.

     6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.

     6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

          a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

          b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     6.4 Required Notices.

          a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

          b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.

     6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.

     7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, THAT ANY CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S EXTENSIONS MEET ANY STANDARD OF COMPATIBILITY OR DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.

     12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

     12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

     12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

13.0 Miscellaneous.

     13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

     13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

     13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

     13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

     13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

     13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations.

You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&#39;s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

     13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         &lt;p&gt;This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License.
         However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent
         only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under
         the terms of this License to Licensor&amp;apos;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are
         required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code
         of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively
         defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License.
         In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for
         the benefit of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You may:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

          Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License
             either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from
             several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but
             the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
             liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&amp;apos;t work properly or causes You any
             injury or damages.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License,
             provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third
             parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all
             Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
          Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for
             Your customers.
        &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You may not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
          Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee
             not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and
             distribution involve physical media.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict
             the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form

          &lt;p&gt;Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of this License You must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;

             the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in
             the Source Code and in a text file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and
             Your Extensions.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
          Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an
             Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
          Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and
             include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and

          Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to
             trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
             or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3
             and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may
             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its
             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
             to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that
             Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the
             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances
             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the
             patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each
             Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
             infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any
             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your
             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

      Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses
         granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works,
         or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute
         are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any
         Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this
         License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to
         Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those
         intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,
         create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions
         You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or
         Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every
         copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any
         Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or
         restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.

                 Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as
                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its
                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain
                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the
                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                 third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in
                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and
                 distribution involve physical media.
            &lt;/li&gt;

                 contribute, to update the file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting
                 the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates
                 of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear
                 in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that
                 the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include
                 the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code
                 and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related
                 documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may
                 not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the
                 Licensed Software.
            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&amp;apos;s intellectual property
                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; that describes the claim and the party making
                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such
                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall
                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take
                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated

                  Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&amp;quot;API&amp;quot;) and You
                     have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You
                     must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                     that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient
                     rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the
                 Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe
                 recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in
                 EXHIBIT A (the &amp;quot;Notice&amp;quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the
                 Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a
                 Contributor to the text file titled &amp;quot;CONTRIB&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along
                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a
                 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a
                 location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
                 notice.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially
                 Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification
                 the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and
                 instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire
                 updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised
                 instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify
                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,
                 mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index
                 them.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so
                 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make
                 it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by
                 the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 terms You offer.

              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being
                 Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another
                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your
                 Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict
                 with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
                 conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission
                 will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.
            &lt;/li&gt;

      Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of
         the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
         choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
         published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable
         to Licensed Software created under this License.

          If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply
             it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your
             license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that
             Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may
             not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this
             License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You
             require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public
             License or simply the RPL.

      High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED,
         MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS
         ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES,
         AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT
         MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD
         DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&amp;quot;HIGH RISK
         ACTIVITIES&amp;quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY
         OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.
    &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for
         claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
         this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.
         This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
         Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
         use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties
         and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and
         Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms
         of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
         to constitute any admission of liability.
    &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.0&lt;/var&gt;
      Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the
         event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or
         restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or
         prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any
         use of Licensed Software.
      
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.1&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
             automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within
             thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software
             that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by
             their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.2&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a
             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to
             herein as &amp;quot;Respondent&amp;quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any
             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of
             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the
             &amp;quot;Notice Period&amp;quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed
             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty
             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and
             4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.3&lt;/var&gt;
          Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent
             alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim
             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under
             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
             or license.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.4&lt;/var&gt;
          No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user
             license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly
             granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
             termination.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;

          U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined
             in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;commercial
             computer software documentation,&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
             Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
             U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth

          Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
             joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any
             Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,

          Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&amp;apos;s right to acquire,
             license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the
             same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop,
             produce, market, or distribute.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.4&lt;/var&gt;
          Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this
             License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.5&lt;/var&gt;
          Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
             hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
             reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any
             of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to
             statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the
             software.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring,
             exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by
             United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise
             obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all

          Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp;amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions
             (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License
             shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American

             grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving
             any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered
             and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&amp;apos;s
             fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary
             to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court
             of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&amp;apos;s
             fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
             International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights
             to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or
             regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the

However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.\n\nThis License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may:\n\na. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.\n\nb. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.\n\nc. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.\n\nd. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may not:\n\na. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.\n\nb. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\nc. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.\n\nd. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or\n\nContributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You must:\n\na. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.\n\nb. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.\n\nc. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.\n\nd.

You are not required to accept this License since you have not signed it, however nothing else grants you permission to use, copy, distribute, modify, or create derivatives of either the Software or any Extensions created by a Contributor. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by performing any of these actions You indicate Your acceptance of this License and Your agreement to be bound by all its terms and conditions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE DO NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE. IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE THEN YOU CAN NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE.\n\n3.0 Grant of License From Licensor.

Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n     5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.\n\n6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.\n\n     6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n     6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\n     6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n          a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n          c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     6.4 Required Notices.\n\n          a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n          b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n     6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n     7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, THAT ANY CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S EXTENSIONS MEET ANY STANDARD OF COMPATIBILITY OR DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (\&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES\&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.\n\n     12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n     12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \&quot;Respondent\&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \&quot;Notice Period\&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n     12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n     12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n     13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot; and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n     13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise.\n\n     13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.\n\n     13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n     13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n     13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.\n\n     13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n     13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&#39;s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n     13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n\nEXHIBIT A\n\nThe Notice below must appear in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software or any Extensions thereto, except as may be modified as allowed under the terms of Section 7.1\nCopyright (C) 1999-2002 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Your Extensions may\n             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its\n             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if\n             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted\n             to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that\n             Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n      \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.1&lt;/var&gt;\n          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the\n             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances\n             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the\n             patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each\n             Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on\n             infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any\n             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent\n             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your\n             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses\n         granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works,\n         or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute\n         are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any\n         Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this\n         License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to\n         Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those\n         intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,\n         create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions\n         You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or\n         Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every\n         copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any\n         Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or\n         restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1&lt;/var&gt;\n              Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source\n                 Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as\n                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic\n                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its\n                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain\n                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the\n                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a\n                 third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in\n                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and\n                 distribution involve physical media.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.2&lt;/var&gt;\n              Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You\n                 contribute, to update the file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting\n                 the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates\n                 of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear\n                 in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that\n                 the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include\n                 the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code\n                 and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related\n                 documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may\n                 not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the\n                 Licensed Software.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.3&lt;/var&gt;\n              Intellectual Property Matters.\n              \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&amp;apos;s intellectual property\n                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file\n                     with the Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; that describes the claim and the party making\n                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such\n                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall\n                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take\n                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n                     to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been\n                     obtained.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&amp;quot;API&amp;quot;) and You\n                     have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You\n                     must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe\n                     that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient\n                     rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                  \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.4&lt;/var&gt;\n              Required Notices.\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;\n              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the\n                 Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe\n                 recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in\n                 EXHIBIT A (the &amp;quot;Notice&amp;quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the\n                 Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a\n                 Contributor to the text file titled &amp;quot;CONTRIB&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along\n                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a\n                 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a\n                 location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a\n                 notice.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;\n              Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially\n                 Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification\n                 the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and\n                 instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire\n                 updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised\n                 instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify\n                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,\n                 mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index\n                 them.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                  \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.5&lt;/var&gt;\n              Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n                 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so\n                 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make\n                 it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\n                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability\n                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by\n                 the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n                 terms You offer.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.6&lt;/var&gt;\n              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being\n                 Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another\n                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your\n                 Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict\n                 with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the\n                 conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission\n                 will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Versions of This License.

Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the\n         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\n         choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License\n         published by Licensor.

In so naming Your license, You may\n             not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n             (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY\n             DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY\n             PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER\n             INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE\n             OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL\n             HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n             APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE\n             EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\n             OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n             APPLY TO YOU.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED,\n         MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS\n         ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES,\n         AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT\n         MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD\n         DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&amp;quot;HIGH RISK\n         ACTIVITIES&amp;quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY\n         OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for\n         claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under\n         this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.\n         This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of\n         Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against\n         use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties\n         and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and\n         Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms\n         of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed\n         to constitute any admission of liability.\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the\n         event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or\n         restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or\n         prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any\n         use of Licensed Software.\n      \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.1&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n             automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within\n             thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software\n             that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by\n             their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.2&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a\n             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\n             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to\n             herein as &amp;quot;Respondent&amp;quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any\n             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of\n             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the\n             &amp;quot;Notice Period&amp;quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay\n             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed\n             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty\n             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and\n             4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.3&lt;/var&gt;\n          Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent\n             alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim\n             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement\n             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under\n             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment\n             or license.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.4&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user\n             license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly\n             granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n             termination.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Miscellaneous.\n      \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.1&lt;/var&gt;\n          U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined\n             in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;commercial\n             computer software documentation,&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).\n             Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n             U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth\n             herein.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.2&lt;/var&gt;\n          Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,\n             joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any\n             Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,\n             appearance, or otherwise.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.3&lt;/var&gt;\n          Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&amp;apos;s right to acquire,\n             license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the\n             same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop,\n             produce, market, or distribute.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.4&lt;/var&gt;\n          Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this\n             License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.5&lt;/var&gt;\n          Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n             hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be\n             reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.6&lt;/var&gt;\n          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any\n             of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to\n             statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the\n             software.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.7&lt;/var&gt;\n          Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring,\n             exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by\n             United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise\n             obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all\n             applicable laws and regulations.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.8&lt;/var&gt;\n          Arbitration, Jurisdiction &amp;amp; Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions\n             (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its\n             conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License\n             shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American\n             Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and\n             grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving\n             any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered\n             and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&amp;apos;s\n             fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary\n             to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court\n             of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&amp;apos;s\n             fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n             International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights\n             to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or\n             regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\n             drafter shall not apply to this License.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.9&lt;/var&gt;\n          Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect\n             to the subject matter hereof.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n      &lt;div class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; \n         &lt;p&gt;EXHIBIT A&lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;The Notice below must appear in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed\n         Software or any Extensions thereto, except as may be modified as allowed under the terms of Section\n         7.1\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) 1999-2002 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.

However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.\n\nThis License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may:\n\na. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.\n\nb. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.\n\nc. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.\n\nd. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may not:\n\na. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.\n\nb. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\nc. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.\n\nd. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or\n\nContributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You must:\n\na. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.\n\nb. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.\n\nc. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.\n\nd. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.\n\nLICENSE TERMS\n\n1.0 General; Applicability &amp; Definitions.

Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.\n\n     6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n     6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\n     6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n          a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n          c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     6.4 Required Notices.\n\n          a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n          b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n     6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n     7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty.

LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10.

You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n12.0 Termination.

Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n     12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \&quot;Respondent\&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \&quot;Notice Period\&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n     12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n     12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n     13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n     13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 3\n             and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may\n             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its\n             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if\n             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted\n             to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that\n             Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n      \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.1&lt;/var&gt;\n          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the\n             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances\n             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the\n             patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each\n             Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on\n             infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any\n             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent\n             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your\n             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses\n         granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works,\n         or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute\n         are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any\n         Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this\n         License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to\n         Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those\n         intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,\n         create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions\n         You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or\n         Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every\n         copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any\n         Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or\n         restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1&lt;/var&gt;\n              Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source\n                 Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as\n                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic\n                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its\n                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain\n                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the\n                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a\n                 third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in\n                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and\n                 distribution involve physical media.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.2&lt;/var&gt;\n              Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You\n                 contribute, to update the file titled &amp;quot;CHANGES&amp;quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting\n                 the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates\n                 of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear\n                 in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that\n                 the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include\n                 the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code\n                 and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related\n                 documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may\n                 not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the\n                 Licensed Software.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.3&lt;/var&gt;\n              Intellectual Property Matters.\n              \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&amp;apos;s intellectual property\n                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file\n                     with the Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; that describes the claim and the party making\n                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such\n                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall\n                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take\n                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n                     to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been\n                     obtained.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&amp;quot;API&amp;quot;) and You\n                     have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You\n                     must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;\n                  Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe\n                     that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient\n                     rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                  \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.4&lt;/var&gt;\n              Required Notices.\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;\n              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the\n                 Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe\n                 recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in\n                 EXHIBIT A (the &amp;quot;Notice&amp;quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the\n                 Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a\n                 Contributor to the text file titled &amp;quot;CONTRIB&amp;quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along\n                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a\n                 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a\n                 location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a\n                 notice.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;\n              Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially\n                 Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification\n                 the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and\n                 instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire\n                 updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised\n                 instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify\n                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,\n                 mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index\n                 them.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                  \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.5&lt;/var&gt;\n              Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n                 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so\n                 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make\n                 it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\n                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability\n                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by\n                 the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n                 terms You offer.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.6&lt;/var&gt;\n              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being\n                 Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another\n                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your\n                 Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict\n                 with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the\n                 conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission\n                 will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n         &lt;/li&gt;\n         \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.0&lt;/var&gt;\n      Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of\n         the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the\n         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\n         choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License\n         published by Licensor.

In so naming Your license, You may\n             not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor.

If You initiate litigation by asserting a\n             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\n             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to\n             herein as &amp;quot;Respondent&amp;quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any\n             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of\n             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the\n             &amp;quot;Notice Period&amp;quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay\n             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed\n             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty\n             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and\n             4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.3&lt;/var&gt;\n          Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent\n             alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim\n             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement\n             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under\n             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment\n             or license.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.4&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Retroactive Effect of Termination.

You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and\n             grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving\n             any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered\n             and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&amp;apos;s\n             fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary\n             to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court\n             of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&amp;apos;s\n             fees and costs.

Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.2\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software.

If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs.

You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.5\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.6\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.0\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.0\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.

As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.0\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Termination Upon Breach.

If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \&quot;Respondent\&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \&quot;Notice Period\&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent.

Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.5\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Severability.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.7\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Export Restrictions.

You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&#39;s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License.

b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software. 
c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate. 
d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or 

Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.

This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. 
b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download. 
c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates. 
d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 

5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software. 

6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. 

6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media. 

6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software. 

6.3 Intellectual Property Matters. 
a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained. 
b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

6.4 Required Notices. 
a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. 
b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them. 

6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor. 

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License. 

7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL. 

8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, THAT ANY CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S EXTENSIONS MEET ANY STANDARD OF COMPATIBILITY OR DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. 

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software. 

12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. 

12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. 

12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 

12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 

13.0 Miscellaneous.

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute. 

13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. 

13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 

13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. \n\nThis License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License.

Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate. \nd. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or \n\nContributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License. \nUnder the terms of this License You must: \na. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. \nb. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download. \nc. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates. \nd. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License. \n\nLICENSE TERMS \n\n1.0 General; Applicability &amp; Definitions.

Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. \n\n6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained. \nb. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \nc. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n6.4 Required Notices. \na. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. \nb. Source Code Availability.

Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them. \n\n6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor. \n\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.

In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. \n\n6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media. \n\n6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software. \n\n6.3 Intellectual Property Matters. \na. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained. \nb. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \nc. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n6.4 Required Notices. \na. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. \nb. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them. \n\n6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor. \n\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License. \n\n7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL. \n\n8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty.

If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. \n\n12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \n\n12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. \n\n13.0 Miscellaneous. \n\n13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

PREAMBLE

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

   a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.

   b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.

   c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.

   d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

   a. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions, other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.

   b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or License text in the Licensed Software.

   c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License, or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.

   d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise that You represent Licensor or

   Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

   a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change. This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.

   b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.

   c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code and future updates.

   d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

   6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.

      6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.

      6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled &quot;CHANGES&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions.

You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.

      6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

         a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

         b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      6.4 Required Notices.

         a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

         b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.

      6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

   7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.

No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.

      7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

      12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

PREAMBLE\n\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.\n\nThis License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor&#39;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may:\n\n   a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty or other fee.\n\n   b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&#39;t work properly or causes You any injury or damages.\n\n   c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License, document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.\n\n   d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations for Your customers.\n\nUnder the terms of this License You may not:\n\n   a.

Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n      5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.\n\n   6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.\n\n      6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n      6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\n      6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n         a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n         b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n         c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n      6.4 Required Notices.\n\n         a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n         b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n      6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n   7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n      7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n   8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (\&quot;HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES\&quot;). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n   11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n   12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.\n\n      12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.

Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n      12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \&quot;Respondent\&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \&quot;Notice Period\&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n      12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n      12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n   13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n      13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

Nothing in this License will impair Licensor&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.\n\n      13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n      13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n      13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.\n\n      13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations.

You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney&#39;s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n      13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n      5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.\n\n      6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n      6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \&quot;CHANGES\&quot; distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\n      6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n         a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n         b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\&quot;API\&quot;) and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n         c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n      6.4 Required Notices.\n\n         a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \&quot;Notice\&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \&quot;CONTRIB\&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n         b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n      6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n   7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n      7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n   8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n   11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n   12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software.\n\n      12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.

Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n      12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \&quot;Respondent\&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \&quot;Notice Period\&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n      12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n      12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n   13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n      13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n      13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n      13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
