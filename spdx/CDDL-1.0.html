     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or devices.

2.2. Contributor Grant.
Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

     (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

                The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor
                   first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.
              &lt;/li&gt;

                Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that
                   Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i)
                   third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications
                   made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version)
                   or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence
                   of Modifications made by that Contributor.
              &lt;/li&gt;

            Availability of Source Code.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form
                   must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
                   distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this
                   License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
                   or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
                   in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form
                   in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Modifications.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                   this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original
                   creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
                   License.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Notices.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
                   Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
                   trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
                   or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
                   Developer.

          &lt;/li&gt;

            Application of Additional Terms.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that
                   alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos;
                   rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                   However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                   Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
                   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
                   License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                   different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                   this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
                   alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
                   in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                   different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                   this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
                   You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                   such terms You offer.

          &lt;/li&gt;

            Larger Works.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by
                   the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                   a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                   Covered Software.

          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;

            New Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
                   versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
                   distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than
                   the license steward has the right to modify this License.

          &lt;/li&gt;

            Effect of New Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
                   prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
                   version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
                   the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                   License published by the license steward.

          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Modified Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
                   Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                   the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
                   note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                   the license contains terms which differ from this License.

          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;

        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
        &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
           WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
           THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
           NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
           WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
           DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
           CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE
           OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;
            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
               with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
               Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
               License shall survive.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
               Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
               assert such claim is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that the Participant
               Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
               Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
               infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
               Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
               Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
               Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice
               period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
               Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
               agreement with Participant.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been
               validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
               granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
        &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
           OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
           COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
           INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
           LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
           MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
           BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
           TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
           EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
           OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
           APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
        &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
           2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; (as that term is
           defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;quot;commercial computer software
           documentation&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
           48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
           End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.
           Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
           or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        MISCELLANEOUS.
        &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
           of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
           extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
           jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
           extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&amp;apos;s
           conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
           jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
           contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
           including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and expenses.
           The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
           Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
           contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
           that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
           regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
           distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
        &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
           arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
           work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
           Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;

        and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications 
        made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor 
        Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have 
        made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor 
        (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that 
        Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date 
        Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a 
        third party.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for 
        any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for 
        infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or 
        (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software 
        (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent 
        Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by 
        that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
    form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form 
    must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of 
    this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You 
    distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such 
    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered 
    Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
    customarily used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the 
    terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
    original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by 
    this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
    Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
    trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
    that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights 
    hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of 
    this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
    License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter 
    the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. 
    If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, 
    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered 
    by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to 
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not 
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
    product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
    fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or 
    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than 
    the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
    available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
    received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the 
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which 
    You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
    Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
    (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
    clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
    fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
    becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in 
    effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
    actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
    Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging 
    that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant 
    is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) 
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is 
    not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You 
    withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
    either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
    licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
    termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
    termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

    under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
    the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must 
    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such 
    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily 
    used for software exchange. 

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this 
    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or 
    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor 
    of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices 
    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text 
    giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or 
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You 
    may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations 
    to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
    that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or 
    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for 
    the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source 
    Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software 
    in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions

    as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this 
    License. 

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under 
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it 
    from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, 
    You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the 
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose 
    to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of 
    any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. 

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove

    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from 
    this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. 
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
    shall survive. 

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against 
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert 
    such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the 
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the 
    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and 
    all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
    (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 
    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively 
    and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period 
    You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either 
    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

                   first distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a third party
                   under the terms of this License.

                Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You
                   delete from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the
                   modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software
                   with other software or devices.

      Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party
                   intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,

                   other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
              &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;

                   dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the
                   combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or
                   portions of such combination).
              &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
                The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor
                   first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.

                Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that
                   Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i)
                   third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications

            Availability of Source Code.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form
                   must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
                   distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this
                   License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
                   or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
                   in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form
                   in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Modifications.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                   this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original
                   creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
                   License.

          &lt;/li&gt;

            Required Notices.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
                   Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
                   trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
                   or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
                   Developer.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.4.&lt;/var&gt;
            Application of Additional Terms.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that
                   alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos;
                   rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                   However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                   Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
                   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
                   License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                   different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                   this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
                   alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
                   in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                   different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                   this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
                   You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                   such terms You offer.

          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
            Larger Works.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by
                   the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                   a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                   Covered Software.

          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;

        Versions of the License.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.&lt;/var&gt;
            New Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
                   versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
                   distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than
                   the license steward has the right to modify this License.

          &lt;/li&gt;

            Effect of New Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
                   prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
                   version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
                   the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                   License published by the license steward.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Modified Versions.
              &lt;br /&gt;

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
                   Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                   the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
                   note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                   the license contains terms which differ from this License.

          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;

        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
        &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
           WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
           THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
           NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
           WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
           DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
           CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE
           OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;

            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
               with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
               Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
               License shall survive.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
               Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
               assert such claim is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that the Participant
               Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
               Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
               infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
               Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
               Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
               Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice
               period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
               Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
               agreement with Participant.

            In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been
               validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
               granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
          &lt;/li&gt;

        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
        &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
           OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
           COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
           INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
           LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
           MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
           BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
           TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
           EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
           OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
           APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

        U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
        &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
           2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; (as that term is
           defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;quot;commercial computer software
           documentation&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
           48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
           End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.
           Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
           or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        MISCELLANEOUS.
        &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
           of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
           extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
           jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
           extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&amp;apos;s
           conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
           jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
           contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
           including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and expenses.
           The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
           Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
           contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
           that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
           regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
           distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&lt;/p&gt;

Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Availability of Source Code.\nAny Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n3.2. Modifications.\nThe Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.3. Required Notices.\nYou must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n4.1. New Versions.\nSun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n4.2. Effect of New Versions.\nYou may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified Versions.\nWhen You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n&quot;,

You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License.

Effect of New Versions.\nYou may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified Versions.\nWhen You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n&quot;,

Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&#39;s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n   &quot;

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.

You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9.

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&quot;,

Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n3.2.

You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&quot;,

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

   4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      4.2. Effect of New Versions.

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

      4.3. Modified Versions.

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

   5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

   9. MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&#39;s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

   10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n      3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.

Application of Additional Terms.\n\n      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n      3.6.

Effect of New Versions.\n\n      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n      4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n   5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   6. TERMINATION.\n\n      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n   7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Software is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation\&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n   9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&#39;s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n   10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&quot;,

Modified Versions.\n\n      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n   5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   6. TERMINATION.\n\n      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n   7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Software is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation\&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n   9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&#39;s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n   10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&quot;,

Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for 
        code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused 
        by: (i) the modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the 
        Original Software with other software or devices.

    2.2. Contributor Grant.

    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party 
    intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, 
    royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable 
        by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and 
        distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), 
        either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software 
        and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications 
        made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor 
        Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have 
        made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor 
        (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that 
        Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date 
        Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a 
        third party.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for 
        any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for 
        infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or 
        (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software 
        (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent 
        Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by 
        that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
    form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form 
    must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of 
    this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You 
    distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such 
    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered 
    Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
    customarily used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the 
    terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
    original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by 
    this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
    Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
    trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
    that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights 
    hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of 
    this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
    License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter 
    the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. 
    If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, 
    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered 
    by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to 
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not 
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
    product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
    fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or 
    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than 
    the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
    available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
    received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the 
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which 
    You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
    Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
    (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
    clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
    fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
    becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in 
    effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
    actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
    Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging 
    that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant 
    is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) 
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is 
    not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You 
    withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
    either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
    licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
    termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
    termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software \n    available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally \n    received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the \n    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available \n    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the \n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which \n    You originally received the Covered Software.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You \n    fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of \n    becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in \n    effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment \n    actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or \n    Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging \n    that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant \n    is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) \n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or \n    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is \n    not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License \n    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically \n    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You \n    withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant \n    either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user \n    licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to \n    termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive \n    termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8.

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software \n    available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally \n    received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the \n    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available \n    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the \n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which \n    You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, \n    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any \n    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your \n    Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: \n    (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward \n    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it \n    clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5.

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
    also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only 
    under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
    the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must 
    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such 
    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily 
    used for software exchange. 

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this 
    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or 
    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor 
    of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices 
    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text 
    giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or 
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You 
    may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations 
    to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
    that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or 
    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for 
    the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source 
    Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software 
    in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or 
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the 
    terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must 
    make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
    of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except 
    as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this 
    License. 

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under 
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it 
    from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, 
    You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the 
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose 
    to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of 
    any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. 

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove 
    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this 
    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from 
    this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply 
    with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. 
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
    shall survive. 

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against 
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert 
    such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the 
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the 
    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and 
    all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
    (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 
    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively 
    and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period 
    You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either 
    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
    validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses 
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must \n    also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only \n    under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of \n    the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must \n    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such \n    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily \n    used for software exchange. \n\n    3.2. Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this \n    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or \n    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor \n    of the Modification.

However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, \n    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear \n    that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You \n    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any \n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, \n    indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or \n    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, \n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for \n    the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source \n    Code form from the rights set forth in this License.

New Versions.\n\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions \n    of this License from time to time.

Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under \n    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered \n    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it \n    from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, \n    You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the \n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose \n    to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of \n    any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. \n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, \n    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove \n    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this \n    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from \n    this License. \n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply \n    with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. \n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License \n    shall survive. \n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against \n    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert \n    such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the \n    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the \n    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and \n    all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer \n    (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 \n    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively \n    and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period \n    You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either \n    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. \n\n    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been \n    validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses \n    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. \n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. \n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. \n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. &quot;,

You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or \n    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor \n    of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices \n    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text \n    giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. \n\n    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or \n    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You \n    may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations \n    to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, \n    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear \n    that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You \n    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any \n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, \n    indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or \n    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, \n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for \n    the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source \n    Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software \n    in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms \n    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or \n    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any \n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \n\n    3.6. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the \n    terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must \n    make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. \n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n    4.1. New Versions.\n\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions \n    of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except \n    as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this \n    License. \n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under \n    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered \n    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it \n    from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, \n    You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the \n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose \n    to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of \n    any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. \n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, \n    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove \n    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this \n    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from \n    this License. \n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply \n    with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. \n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License \n    shall survive. \n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against \n    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert \n    such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the \n    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the \n    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and \n    all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer \n    (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 \n    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively \n    and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period \n    You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either \n    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. \n\n    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been \n    validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses \n    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. \n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. \n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. \n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. &quot;,
