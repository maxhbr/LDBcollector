L'attention\ndu Licencié a été attirée sur ce point sur les risques associés au\nchargement, à l'utilisation, la modification et/ou au développement et à\nla reproduction du Logiciel qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.\n\nIl relève de la responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous\nmoyens, l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et\nde s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux biens.\n\n9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de concéder\nl'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant notamment les\ndroits visés à l'article 5).\n\n9.3 Le Licencié reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni \"en l'état\" par le\nConcédant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à\nl'article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur commerciale,\nson caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.\n\nEn particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt\nd'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible\navec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni qu'il\nremplira les besoins du Licencié.\n\n9.4 Le Concédant ne garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le\nLogiciel ne porte pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété\nintellectuelle d'un tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout\nautre droit de propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au\nprofit du Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être\ndiligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la\nredistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont\nexercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide\ntechnique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et\njuridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et\nle Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le Concédant dégage\ntoute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la dénomination du\nLogiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est apportée quant à\nl'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur\nl'existence d'une marque.\n\n\n    Article 10 - RESILIATION\n\n10.1 En cas de manquement par le Licencié aux obligations mises à sa\ncharge par le Contrat, le Concédant pourra résilier de plein droit le\nContrat trente (30) jours après notification adressée au Licencié et\nrestée sans effet.\n\n10.2 Le Licencié dont le Contrat est résilié n'est plus autorisé à\nutiliser, modifier ou distribuer le Logiciel.

Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au\nprofit du Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être\ndiligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la\nredistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont\nexercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide\ntechnique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et\njuridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et\nle Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le Concédant dégage\ntoute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la dénomination du\nLogiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est apportée quant à\nl'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur\nl'existence d'une marque.\n\n\n    Article 10 - RESILIATION\n\n10.1 En cas de manquement par le Licencié aux obligations mises à sa\ncharge par le Contrat, le Concédant pourra résilier de plein droit le\nContrat trente (30) jours après notification adressée au Licencié et\nrestée sans effet.\n\n10.2 Le Licencié dont le Contrat est résilié n'est plus autorisé à\nutiliser, modifier ou distribuer le Logiciel.
