Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where the
Sleepycat License says The source code must either be included in the
distribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus
a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source code must either be
included in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no
more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely
redistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While
the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license,
TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the &quot;no more
restrictive&quot; language.

Sleepycat License says The source code must either be included in the
distribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus
a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source code must either be
included in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no
more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely
redistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While
the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license,
TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the &quot;no more
