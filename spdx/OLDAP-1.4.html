Version 1.4, 18 January 1999

Copyright 1998-1999, The OpenLDAP Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

Note: This license is derived from the &quot;Artistic License&quot; as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences exist, the complete license should be read.

PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the Package.

8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced by linking your software with this Package may be used and redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

PREAMBLE 

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which 
a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains 
some semblance of artistic control over the development of the 
package, while giving the users of the package the right to use 
and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, 
plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 

Definitions: 

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files 
created through textual modification. 

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been 
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes 
of the Copyright Holder. 

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or 
copyrights for the package. 

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing 
this Package. 

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the 
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people 
involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it 
to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community 
at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item 
itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. 
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it 
under the same conditions they received it. 

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form 
of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided 
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers. 

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications 
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A 
Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard 
Version. 

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, 
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file 
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you 
do at least ONE of the following: 

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise 
make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications 
to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications 
on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing 
the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the 
Standard Version of the Package. 

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or 
organization. 

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not 
conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, 
and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard 
executable that clearly documents how it differs from the 
Standard Version. 

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright 
Holder. 

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code 
or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the 
following: 

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library 
files, together with instructions (in the manual page or 
equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. 

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source 
of the Package with your modifications. 

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding 
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables 
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in 
manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on 
where to get the Standard Version. 

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright 
Holder. 

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of 
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of 
this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. 
However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other 
(possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise 
this Package as a product of your own. 

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced 
as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically 
fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever 
generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated 
with this Package. 

7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in 
order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package 
shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent 
of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change 
the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail 
the regression tests for the Package. 

8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order 
to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not 
be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall 
under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced 
by linking your software with this Package may be used and

Version 1.4, 18 January 1999 
Copyright 1998-1999, The OpenLDAP Foundation. 
All Rights Reserved. 

Note: 
This license is derived from the &quot;Artistic License&quot; as distributed 
with the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences 
exist, the complete license should be read. 

PREAMBLE 

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which 
a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains 
some semblance of artistic control over the development of the 
package, while giving the users of the package the right to use 
and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, 
plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 

Definitions: 

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files 
created through textual modification. 

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been 
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes 
of the Copyright Holder. 

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or 
copyrights for the package. 

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing 
this Package. 

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the 
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people 
involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it 
to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community 
at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item 
itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. 
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it 
under the same conditions they received it. 

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form 
of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided 
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers. 

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications 
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A 
Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard 
Version. 

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, 
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file 
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you 
do at least ONE of the following: 

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise 
make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications 
to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications 
on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing 
the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the 
Standard Version of the Package. 

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or 
organization. 

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not 
conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, 
and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard 
executable that clearly documents how it differs from the 
Standard Version. 

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright 
Holder. 

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code 
or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the 
following: 

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library 
files, together with instructions (in the manual page or 
equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. 

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source 
of the Package with your modifications. 

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding 
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables 
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in 
manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on 
where to get the Standard Version. 

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright 
Holder. 

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of 
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of 
this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. 
However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other 
(possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise 
this Package as a product of your own. 

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced 
as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically 
fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever 
generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated 
with this Package. 

7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in 
order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package 
shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent 
of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change 
the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail 
the regression tests for the Package. 

8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order 
to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not 
be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall 
under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced 
by linking your software with this Package may be used and 
redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially 
so long as the primary function of your software is different 
than the package itself. 

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or 
promote products derived from this software without specific prior 
written permission. 

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Version 1.4, 18 January 1999 Copyright 1998-1999, The OpenLDAP Foundation. All Rights Reserved. Note: This license is derived from the &quot;Artistic License&quot; as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences exist, the complete license should be read.

PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

      c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the Package.

   8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced by linking your software with this Package may be used and redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.

   9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

Note: This license is derived from the \&quot;Artistic License\&quot; as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences exist, the complete license should be read.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\&quot;Package\&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\&quot;Standard Version\&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n\&quot;Copyright Holder\&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\&quot;You\&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\&quot;Reasonable copying fee\&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\n      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n\n      c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n\n   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n\n   7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the Package.\n\n   8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced by linking your software with this Package may be used and redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.\n\n   9.

            &quot;_fossLight_LICENSE_TEXT&quot;: &quot;The OpenLDAP Public License\nVersion 1.4, 18 January 1999 \n\nCopyright 1998-1999, The OpenLDAP Foundation. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNote: This license is derived from the \&quot;Artistic License\&quot; as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences exist, the complete license should be read.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n     \&quot;Package\&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n     \&quot;Standard Version\&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n     \&quot;Copyright Holder\&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n     \&quot;You\&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n     \&quot;Reasonable copying fee\&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n     \&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n\n     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the Package.\n\n8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order to use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package. Executables produced by linking your software with this Package may be used and redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.\n\n9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n10.
