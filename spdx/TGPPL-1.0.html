Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (&quot;TGPPL&quot;) v. 1.0
=======================================================

This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any
original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the
&quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

 *Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0*

1.  **Grant of Copyright License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of
    the copyright, to do the following:

    a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
       collective work;

    b. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
       Work, thereby creating derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon
       the Original Work;

    c. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
       Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
       Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed
       under this Transitive Grace Period Public Licence no later than 12
       months after You distributed or communicated said copies;

    d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and

    e. to display the Original Work publicly.

2.  **Grant of Patent License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims
    owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
    Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
    and Derivative Works.

3.  **Grant of Source Code License.** The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the
    preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
    all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
    Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
    Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that
    Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
    obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an
    information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
    convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute
    the Original Work.

4.  **Exclusions From License Grant.** Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
    names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
    trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products
    derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the
    Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License
    grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
    secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted
    to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of
    any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No
    license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are
    included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different
    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a
    right to license.

5.  **External Deployment.** The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use,
    distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works
    in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by
    anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or
    communicated to those persons or made available as an application
    intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants
    of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of
    the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section
    1(c).

6.  **Attribution Rights.** You must retain, in the Source Code of any
    Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
    notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices
    of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
    &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
    Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably
    calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7.  **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor warrants
    that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
    granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed
    to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the
    contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
    stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is
    provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY,
    either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties
    of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
    purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
    YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
    License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License
    except under this disclaimer.

8.  **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under no legal
    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
    of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without
    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
    or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
    limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law
    prohibits such limitation.

9.  **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly assented
    to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable
    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You
    distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
    Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
    the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This
    License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in
    Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
    Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions
    is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this
    License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations
    (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate
    immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
    You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
    1(c).

10. **Termination for Patent Action.** This License shall terminate
    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
    You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
    that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision
    shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by
    combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11. **Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.** Any action or suit relating to
    this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
    the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
    and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination
    shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent
    law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the
    termination of this License.

12. **Attorneys&#39; Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License
    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
    limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection
    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall
    survive the termination of this License.

13. **Miscellaneous.** If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.

14. **Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License.** &quot;You&quot; throughout this License,
    whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
    License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is
    controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this
    definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause
    the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15. **Right to Use.** You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
    promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16. **Modification of This License.** This License is Copyright © 2007 Zooko
    Wilcox-O&#39;Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate
    this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to
    modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative
    Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy,
    distribute or communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;)
    and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the
    following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your
    Modified License is the &quot;Transitive Grace Period Public Licence&quot; or
    &quot;TGPPL&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified
    License; and (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first
    paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name
    here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to
    the notice in this License.

                     that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You
                     distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this
                     Transitive Grace Period Public Licence no later than 12

               stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
               Licensor&amp;apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
               any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to
               make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments
               of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in
               Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor
               even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
               in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
               licensing under terms different from this License any Original
               Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
            &lt;/li&gt;

               **External Deployment.** The term &amp;quot;External Deployment&amp;quot; means
               the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work
               or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or
               Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether
               those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or
               made available as an application intended for use over a network.
               As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder,
               You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original
               Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).
            &lt;/li&gt;

               as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
               identified therein as an &amp;quot;Attribution Notice.&amp;quot; You must cause
               the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to
               carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to
               inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

               **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor
               warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work
               and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned
               by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
               of this License with the permission of the contributor(s)
               of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
               stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
               Work is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS
               and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including,
               without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,

               ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
               YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
               part of this License. No license to the Original Work
               is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

               **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under
               no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
               contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
               anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
               damages of any character arising as a result of this License
               or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
               damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
               or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
               or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply
               to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

               **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly
               assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear
               and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its
               terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
               copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must
               make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
               the express assent of recipients to the terms of this
               License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
               the activities listed in Section 1, including your right
               to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,
               and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is
               prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing
               in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions
               and limitations (including &amp;apos;fair use&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;fair dealing&amp;apos;).
               This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer
               exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
               upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

               automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
               granted to You by this License as of the date You commence
               an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against
               Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work
               infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply
               for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations
               of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
            &lt;/li&gt;

               of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
               Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of
               that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
               application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
               the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of
               the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
               termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties
               of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction.
               This section shall survive the termination of this License.

               held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
               only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to
any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the
&quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

*Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0*

   1. *Grant of Copyright License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
      duration of the copyright, to do the following:

         1. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
            part of a collective work;

         2. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange
            the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works
            (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work;

         3. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
            Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies
            of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or
            communicate shall be licensed under this Transitive Grace
            Period Public Licence no later than 12 months after You
            distributed or communicated said copies;

         4. to perform the Original Work publicly; and

         5. to display the Original Work publicly.

   2. *Grant of Patent License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
      claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
      the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration
      of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and
      import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

   3. *Grant of Source Code License.* The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the
      preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
      and all available documentation describing how to modify the
      Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
      of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
      the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
      right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
      copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
      calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
      as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

   4. *Exclusions From License Grant.* Neither the names of Licensor,
      nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of
      their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
      promote products derived from this Original Work without express
      prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated
      herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s
      trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
      intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
      sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any
      patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
      No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such
      marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License
      shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
      terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor
      otherwise would have a right to license.

   5. *External Deployment.* The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the
      use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or
      Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or
      Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether
      those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or
      made available as an application intended for use over a network.
      As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
      must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or
      a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

   6. *Attribution Rights.* You must retain, in the Source Code of any
      Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or
      trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as
      well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
      identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the
      Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
      prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
      recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

   7. *Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.* Licensor
      warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
      patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor
      or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the
      permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent
      rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
      sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
      &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
      including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
      merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
      License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
      License except under this disclaimer.

   8. *Limitation of Liability.* Under no circumstances and under no
      legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
      otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
      indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
      Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
      and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
      liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
      such limitation.

   9. *Acceptance and Termination.* If, at any time, You expressly
      assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and
      irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
      conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
      Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
      effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
      recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
      your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1,
      including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
      Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
      conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international
      treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright
      exceptions and limitations (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair
      dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no
      longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
      upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

  10. *Termination for Patent Action.* This License shall terminate
      automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
      granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
      action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor
      or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
      patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
      alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work
      with other software or hardware.

  11. *Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.* Any action or suit
      relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
      jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
      conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
      jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
      Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
      termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
      copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This
      section shall survive the termination of this License.

  12. *Attorneys&#39; Fees.* In any action to enforce the terms of this
      License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
      shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
      without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred
      in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
      action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

  13. *Miscellaneous.* If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable.

  14. *Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License.* &quot;You&quot; throughout this
      License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
      legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
      the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any
      entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
      with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the
      power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
      such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
      of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
      beneficial ownership of such entity.

  15. *Right to Use.* You may use the Original Work in all ways not
      otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
      Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
      uses by You.

  16. *Modification of This License.* This License is Copyright © 2007
      Zooko Wilcox-O&#39;Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute,
      or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
      License permits You to modify this License as applied to the
      Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the
      text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
      modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other
      original works of authorship subject to the following conditions:
      (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is
      the &quot;Transitive Grace Period Public Licence&quot; or &quot;TGPPL&quot; and you
      may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; and

Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (&quot;TGPPL&quot;) v. 1.0
=======================================================

This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any
original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the
&quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

 *Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0*

1.  **Grant of Copyright License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of
    the copyright, to do the following:

    a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
       collective work;

    b. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
       Work, thereby creating derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon
       the Original Work;

    c. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
       Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
       Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed
       under this Transitive Grace Period Public Licence no later than 12
       months after You distributed or communicated said copies;

    d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and

    e. to display the Original Work publicly.

2.  **Grant of Patent License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims
    owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
    Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
    and Derivative Works.

3.  **Grant of Source Code License.** The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the
    preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
    all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
    Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
    Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that
    Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
    obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an
    information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
    convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute
    the Original Work.

4.  **Exclusions From License Grant.** Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
    names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
    trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products
    derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the
    Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License
    grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
    secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted
    to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of
    any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No
    license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are
    included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different
    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a
    right to license.

5.  **External Deployment.** The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use,
    distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works
    in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by
    anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or
    communicated to those persons or made available as an application
    intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants
    of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of
    the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section
    1(c).

6.  **Attribution Rights.** You must retain, in the Source Code of any
    Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
    notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices
    of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
    &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
    Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably
    calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7.  **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor warrants
    that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
    granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed
    to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the
    contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
    stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is
    provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY,
    either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties
    of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
    purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
    YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
    License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License
    except under this disclaimer.

8.  **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under no legal
    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
    of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without
    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
    or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
    limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law
    prohibits such limitation.

9.  **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly assented
    to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable
    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You
    distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
    Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
    the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This
    License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in
    Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
    Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions
    is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this
    License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations
    (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate
    immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
    You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
    1(c).

10. **Termination for Patent Action.** This License shall terminate
    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
    You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
    that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision
    shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by
    combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11. **Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.** Any action or suit relating to
    this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
    the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
    and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination
    shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent
    law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the
    termination of this License.

12. **Attorneys&#39; Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License
    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
    limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection
    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall
    survive the termination of this License.

13. **Miscellaneous.** If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.

14. **Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License.** &quot;You&quot; throughout this License,
    whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
    License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is
    controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this
    definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause
    the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15. **Right to Use.** You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
    promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16. **Modification of This License.** This License is Copyright © 2007 Zooko
    Wilcox-O&#39;Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate
    this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to
    modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative
    Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy,
    distribute or communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;)
    and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the
    following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your
    Modified License is the &quot;Transitive Grace Period Public Licence&quot; or
    &quot;TGPPL&quot; and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified
    License; and (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first
    paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name
    here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to
    the notice in this License.

               royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
               claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied
               in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the
               duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,

               Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor

               Code in an information repository reasonably calculated
               to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as

               of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse
               or promote products derived from this Original Work without
               express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly
               stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
               Licensor&amp;apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
               any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to

               of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in
               Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor
               even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
               in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
               licensing under terms different from this License any Original
               Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

               the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work
               or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or
               Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether
               those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or
               made available as an application intended for use over a network.
               As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder,
               You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original
               Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

               as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
               identified therein as an &amp;quot;Attribution Notice.&amp;quot; You must cause

               and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned
               by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms

               no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
               contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
               anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
               damages of any character arising as a result of this License
               or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,

               or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
               or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply
               to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

               **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly
               assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear
               and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its
               terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
               copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must
               make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
               the express assent of recipients to the terms of this
               License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
               the activities listed in Section 1, including your right
               to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,
               and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is

               This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer

               granted to You by this License as of the date You commence
               an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against

               application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
               the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of
               the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
               termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties
               of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction.

Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source\n    Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that\n    Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this\n    obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an\n    information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and\n    convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute\n    the Original Work.\n\n4.  **Exclusions From License Grant.** Neither the names of Licensor, nor the\n    names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their\n    trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products\n    derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the\n    Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License\n    grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade\n    secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted\n    to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of\n    any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No\n    license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are\n    included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\n    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different\n    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a\n    right to license.\n\n5.  **External Deployment.** The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the use,\n    distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works\n    in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by\n    anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or\n    communicated to those persons or made available as an application\n    intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants\n    of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of\n    the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section\n    1(c).\n\n6.  **Attribution Rights.** You must retain, in the Source Code of any\n    Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark\n    notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices\n    of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an\n    \&quot;Attribution Notice.\&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative\n    Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably\n    calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n7.  **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor warrants\n    that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights\n    granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed\n    to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the\n    contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly\n    stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is\n    provided under this License on an \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY,\n    either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties\n    of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular\n    purpose.

No license to the Original Work is granted by this License\n    except under this disclaimer.\n\n8.  **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under no legal\n    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result\n    of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without\n    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure\n    or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This\n    limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law\n    prohibits such limitation.\n\n9.  **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly assented\n    to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable\n    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You\n    distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative\n    Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain\n    the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This\n    License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in\n    Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the\n    Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions\n    is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this\n    License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations\n    (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate\n    immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to\n    You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section\n    1(c).\n\n10. **Termination for Patent Action.** This License shall terminate\n    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to\n    You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging\n    that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision\n    shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by\n    combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n11. **Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.** Any action or suit relating to\n    this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein\n    the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,\n    and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law\n    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts\n    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the\n    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination\n    shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent\n    law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the\n    termination of this License.\n\n12. **Attorneys&#39; Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License\n    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be\n    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without\n    limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection\n    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall\n    survive the termination of this License.\n\n13. **Miscellaneous.** If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n14. **Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License.** \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this License,\n    whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\n    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this\n    License. For legal entities, \&quot;You\&quot; includes any entity that controls, is\n    controlled by, or is under common control with you.

Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source\n    Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that\n    Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this\n    obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an\n    information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and\n    convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute\n    the Original Work.\n\n4.  **Exclusions From License Grant.** Neither the names of Licensor, nor the\n    names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their\n    trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products\n    derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the\n    Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License\n    grants any license to Licensor&#39;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade\n    secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted\n    to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of\n    any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No\n    license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are\n    included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\n    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different\n    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a\n    right to license.\n\n5.  **External Deployment.** The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the use,\n    distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works\n    in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by\n    anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or\n    communicated to those persons or made available as an application\n    intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants\n    of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of\n    the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section\n    1(c).\n\n6.  **Attribution Rights.** You must retain, in the Source Code of any\n    Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark\n    notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices\n    of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an\n    \&quot;Attribution Notice.\&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative\n    Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably\n    calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n7.  **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor warrants\n    that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights\n    granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed\n    to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the\n    contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly\n    stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is\n    provided under this License on an \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY,\n    either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties\n    of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular\n    purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH\n    YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this\n    License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License\n    except under this disclaimer.\n\n8.  **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under no legal\n    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result\n    of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without\n    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure\n    or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This\n    limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law\n    prohibits such limitation.\n\n9.  **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly assented\n    to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable\n    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You\n    distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative\n    Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain\n    the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This\n    License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in\n    Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the\n    Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions\n    is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this\n    License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations\n    (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate\n    immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to\n    You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section\n    1(c).\n\n10. **Termination for Patent Action.** This License shall terminate\n    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to\n    You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging\n    that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision\n    shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by\n    combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n11. **Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.** Any action or suit relating to\n    this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein\n    the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,\n    and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law\n    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts\n    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the\n    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination\n    shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent\n    law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the\n    termination of this License.\n\n12. **Attorneys&#39; Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License\n    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be\n    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without\n    limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection\n    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall\n    survive the termination of this License.\n\n13. **Miscellaneous.** If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n14. **Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License.** \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this License,\n    whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\n    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this\n    License. For legal entities, \&quot;You\&quot; includes any entity that controls, is\n    controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this\n    definition, \&quot;control\&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause\n    the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n15. **Right to Use.** You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\n    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor\n    promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\n16. **Modification of This License.** This License is Copyright © 2007 Zooko\n    Wilcox-O&#39;Hearn.

This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to
any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the
&quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

*Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0*

   1. *Grant of Copyright License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
      duration of the copyright, to do the following:

         1. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
            part of a collective work;

         2. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange
            the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works
            (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work;

         3. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
            Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies
            of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or
            communicate shall be licensed under this Transitive Grace
            Period Public Licence no later than 12 months after You
            distributed or communicated said copies;

         4. to perform the Original Work publicly; and

         5. to display the Original Work publicly.

   2. *Grant of Patent License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
      claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
      the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration
      of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and
      import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

   3. *Grant of Source Code License.* The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the
      preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
      and all available documentation describing how to modify the
      Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
      of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
      the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
      right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
      copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
      calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
      as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

   4. *Exclusions From License Grant.* Neither the names of Licensor,
      nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of
      their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
      promote products derived from this Original Work without express
      prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated
      herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s
      trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
      intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
      sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any
      patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
      No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such
      marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License
      shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
      terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor
      otherwise would have a right to license.

   5. *External Deployment.* The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the
      use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or
      Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or
      Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether
      those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or
      made available as an application intended for use over a network.
      As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
      must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or
      a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

   6. *Attribution Rights.* You must retain, in the Source Code of any
      Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or
      trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as
      well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
      identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the
      Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
      prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
      recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

   7. *Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.* Licensor
      warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
      patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor
      or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the
      permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent
      rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
      sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
      &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
      including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
      merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
      License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
      License except under this disclaimer.

   8. *Limitation of Liability.* Under no circumstances and under no
      legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
      otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
      indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
      Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
      and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
      liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
      such limitation.

   9. *Acceptance and Termination.* If, at any time, You expressly
      assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and
      irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
      conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
      Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
      effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
      recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
      your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1,
      including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
      Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
      conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international
      treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright
      exceptions and limitations (including &#39;fair use&#39; or &#39;fair
      dealing&#39;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no
      longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
      upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

  10. *Termination for Patent Action.* This License shall terminate
      automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
      granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
      action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor
      or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
      patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
      alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work
      with other software or hardware.

  11. *Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.* Any action or suit
      relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
      jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
      conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
      jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
      Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
      termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
      copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This
      section shall survive the termination of this License.

  12. *Attorneys&#39; Fees.* In any action to enforce the terms of this
      License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
      shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
      without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred
      in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
      action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

  13. *Miscellaneous.* If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable.

  14. *Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License.* &quot;You&quot; throughout this
      License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
      legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
      the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any
      entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
      with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the
      power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
      such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
      of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
      beneficial ownership of such entity.

  15. *Right to Use.* You may use the Original Work in all ways not
      otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
      Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
      uses by You.

  16. *Modification of This License.* This License is Copyright © 2007
      Zooko Wilcox-O&#39;Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute,
      or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
      License permits You to modify this License as applied to the
      Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the
      text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
      modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other
      original works of authorship subject to the following conditions:
      (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is
      the &quot;Transitive Grace Period Public Licence&quot; or &quot;TGPPL&quot; and you
      may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; and
      (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph
      above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &quot; or with a notice of your
      own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

No license to the Original Work is granted by this\n      License except under this disclaimer.\n\n   8. *Limitation of Liability.* Under no circumstances and under no\n      legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or\n      otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any\n      indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n      character arising as a result of this License or the use of the\n      Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of\n      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any\n      and all other commercial damages or losses.

This termination provision shall not apply for an action\n      alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work\n      with other software or hardware.\n\n  11. *Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.* Any action or suit\n      relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a\n      jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor\n      conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that\n      jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\n      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the\n      Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its\n      termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of\n      copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This\n      section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n  12. *Attorneys&#39; Fees.* In any action to enforce the terms of this\n      License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party\n      shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,\n      without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred\n      in connection with such action, including any appeal of such\n      action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n  13. *Miscellaneous.* If any provision of this License is held to be\n      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n      necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n  14. *Definition of \&quot;You\&quot; in This License.* \&quot;You\&quot; throughout this\n      License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a\n      legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of\n      the terms of, this License.

        &quot;_text&quot;: &quot;Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (\&quot;TGPPL\&quot;) v. 1.0\n\nThis Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to\nany original work of authorship (the \&quot;Original Work\&quot;) whose owner (the\n\&quot;Licensor\&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the\ncopyright notice for the Original Work:\n\n*Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0*\n\n   1. *Grant of Copyright License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,\n      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the\n      duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n         1. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as\n            part of a collective work;\n\n         2. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange\n            the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works\n            (\&quot;Derivative Works\&quot;) based upon the Original Work;\n\n         3. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and\n            Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies\n            of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or\n            communicate shall be licensed under this Transitive Grace\n            Period Public Licence no later than 12 months after You\n            distributed or communicated said copies;\n\n         4. to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\n         5. to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n   2. *Grant of Patent License.* Licensor grants You a worldwide,\n      royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent\n      claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in\n      the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration\n      of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\n      import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n   3. *Grant of Source Code License.* The term \&quot;Source Code\&quot; means the\n      preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it\n      and all available documentation describing how to modify the\n      Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy\n      of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of\n      the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the\n      right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable\n      copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably\n      calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for\n      as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n   4. *Exclusions From License Grant.* Neither the names of Licensor,\n      nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of\n      their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or\n      promote products derived from this Original Work without express\n      prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated\n      herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor&#39;s\n      trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other\n      intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,\n      sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any\n      patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.\n      No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such\n      marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License\n      shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under\n      terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor\n      otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n   5. *External Deployment.* The term \&quot;External Deployment\&quot; means the\n      use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or\n      Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or\n      Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether\n      those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or\n      made available as an application intended for use over a network.\n      As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You\n      must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or\n      a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n   6. *Attribution Rights.* You must retain, in the Source Code of any\n      Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or\n      trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as\n      well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text\n      identified therein as an \&quot;Attribution Notice.\&quot; You must cause the\n      Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a\n      prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform\n      recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n   7. *Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.* Licensor\n      warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the\n      patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor\n      or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the\n      permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent\n      rights.
