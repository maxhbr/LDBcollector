Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

     * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and
     * its license agreement:
          * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
          * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
          * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.

3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

     * it must be made available under this License; and
     * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.

5. NO WARRANTY

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.

8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.

11. GENERAL

11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.

11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&#39;elles ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais.

11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and authorizations.

11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Version 1.1
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
         TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&amp;quot;LICENSE&amp;quot;). ANY USE,
         REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S ACCEPTANCE
         OF THIS LICENSE.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;License Background&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source
         development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality,
         growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the
         Program (as defined below) under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program,
         including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
         Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program,
         to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of
         this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be
         distributed under the terms of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

                 additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to
                 unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to
                 the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf.
                 Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of

                 (y) are not derivative works of the Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

              Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the
                 Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

              Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by
                 the terms of this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.5&lt;/var&gt;
              Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale
                 of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.6&lt;/var&gt;
              Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.7&lt;/var&gt;
              Program means the Original Program and Contributions.
            &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

          GRANT OF RIGHTS
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.1&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
                 publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the
                 avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to
                 any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.2&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary
                 to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
                 source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the
                 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
                 the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
                 by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section
                 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and
                 is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
                 modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by
                 each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
                 devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
                 Contributions made by that Contributor.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.3&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
                 forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
                 that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
                 other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
                 brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
                 otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
                 Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
                 needed, if any.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.4&lt;/var&gt;
              Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the
                 copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth
                 in this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.1&lt;/var&gt;
              If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in
                 the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the
                 Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the
                 source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
                 own license agreement, provided that:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  its license agreement:
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
                     express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
                     and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
                     purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
                     direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits,
                     to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that
                     Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of
                     distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.2&lt;/var&gt;
              When the Program is made available in source code form:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  it must be made available under this License; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.3&lt;/var&gt;
              This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any
                 Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the
                 distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge,
                 license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this
                 License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version
                 they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to
                 physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
                 Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to
                 a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions
                 on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.4&lt;/var&gt;
              A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not
                 governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                 such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
                 fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
                 offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other
                 Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance
                 warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may
                 create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
                 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby
                 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made
                 Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,
                 damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
                 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
                 or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor
                 in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not
                 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
                 infringement.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5&lt;/var&gt;
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is
                 required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                 Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
                 ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One
                 Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at
                 opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
                 detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If
                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall
                 also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter
                 and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                 reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has
                 been obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.6&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent
                 proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in
                 any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor
                 must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
                 reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1&lt;/var&gt;
              Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to
                 contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the
                 Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement
                 that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a
                 prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution
                 was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
                 related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the
                 Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT
                 STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR
                 IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE,

              Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
                 distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
                 this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance

                 facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in
                 which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical

                 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
                 THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
                 OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF
                 ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                 trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to
                 any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees
                 not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original
                 Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.2&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and
                 product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution
                 notices remain in the Program.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.1&lt;/var&gt;
              If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim
                 or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the
                 Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such
                 Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
                 filed.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each
                 Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such
                 Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any
                 Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will
                 not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to
                 license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained
                 in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

              All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
                 material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
                 period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this
                 License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
                 reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses
                 granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
                 termination.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
                 affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
                 without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
                 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.2&lt;/var&gt;
              CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new
                 version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
                 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it
                 was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may
                 elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
                 other than CA has the right to modify this License.

              If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must:
                 (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file
                 described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source
                 code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal
                 action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient
                 waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute
                 resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State
                 of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue
                 in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The
                 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                 is expressly excluded.

                 drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&amp;apos;elles ont exige que le

              The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country
                 in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with
                 and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of
                 such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and

Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE
ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER
ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We
believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate
software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and
innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we
are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the
Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and
without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined
below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to
permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License
unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program
must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under
which you may use the Program.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and
(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and
additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the
Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do
not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes
the Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the
Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any
Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions
thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
with the Program.

1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which
this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code,
object code and documentation, if any.

1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the
Program.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1
shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell,
offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section
2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is
granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not
include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance
with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of
Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except
as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with
respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in
Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity
based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,
title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the
right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent
notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related
documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available
from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the
source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in
object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and 
b. its license agreement: 
	i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
	conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
	and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
	merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent
	permitted by applicable law;
	ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
	damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
	damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
	law; 
	iii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
	iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such 
	Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain
	it in a reasonable manner.

3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

a. it must be made available under this License; and 
b. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution
of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge
Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.
Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license
fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights
under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source
code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if
any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and
distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a
Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an
attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties
or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with
other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the
Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may
subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual
commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and
non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No
Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)
who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial
Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of
such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)
include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates
International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York
11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both
describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such
matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is
made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES
file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such
new knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other
Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the
Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any
documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4,
each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor
provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the
Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of

Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.

   1. DEFINITIONS

      1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

      1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.

      1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

      1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

      1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

      1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

      1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

      1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.

   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

      2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

      2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

      2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

   3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

      3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

         * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and

         * its license agreement:

         * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;

         * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;

         * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.

      3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

         * it must be made available under this License; and

         * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

      3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

      3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.

      3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.

      3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

      4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.

      5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

      5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

      6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

      7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.

   8. PATENT LITIGATION

      8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   9. OWNERSHIP

      9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.

5. NO WARRANTY

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.

8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.

11. GENERAL

11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.

11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&#39;elles ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais.

11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and authorizations.

11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

        &lt;br /&gt;

Version 1.1
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
         TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&amp;quot;LICENSE&amp;quot;). ANY USE,
         REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S ACCEPTANCE
         OF THIS LICENSE.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;License Background&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source
         development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality,
         growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the
         Program (as defined below) under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program,
         including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
         Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program,
         to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of
         this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be
         distributed under the terms of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

                 additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to
                 unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to
                 the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf.
                 Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of

                 (y) are not derivative works of the Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

              Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the
                 Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

              Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by
                 the terms of this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

              Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale
                 of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.7&lt;/var&gt;
              Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.1&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
                 publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the
                 avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to
                 any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.2&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary
                 to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
                 source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the
                 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
                 the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
                 by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section
                 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and
                 is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
                 modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by
                 each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
                 devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
                 Contributions made by that Contributor.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.3&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
                 forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
                 that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
                 other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
                 brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
                 otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
                 Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
                 needed, if any.
            &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.4&lt;/var&gt;
              Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the
                 copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth
                 in this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.1&lt;/var&gt;
              If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in
                 the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the
                 Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the
                 source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
                 own license agreement, provided that:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  its license agreement:
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
                     express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
                     and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
                     purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
                     direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits,
                     to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that
                     Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of
                     distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.2&lt;/var&gt;
              When the Program is made available in source code form:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  it must be made available under this License; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
                  a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.3&lt;/var&gt;
              This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any
                 Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the
                 distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge,
                 license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this
                 License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version
                 they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to
                 physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
                 Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to
                 a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions
                 on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.4&lt;/var&gt;
              A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not
                 governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                 such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
                 fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
                 offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other
                 Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance
                 warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may
                 create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
                 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby
                 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made
                 Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,
                 damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
                 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
                 or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor
                 in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not
                 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
                 infringement.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5&lt;/var&gt;
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is
                 required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                 Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
                 ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One
                 Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at
                 opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
                 detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If
                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall
                 also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter
                 and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                 reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has
                 been obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.6&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent
                 proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in
                 any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor
                 must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
                 reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

              Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to
                 contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the
                 Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement
                 that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a
                 prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution
                 was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
                 related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the
                 Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
                 distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
                 this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance

                 facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in
                 which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical

                 any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees
                 not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original
                 Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.

              Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and
                 product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution
                 notices remain in the Program.

              If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim
                 or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the
                 Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such
                 Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is

              Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each
                 Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such
                 Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any
                 Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will
                 not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to

                 in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

              All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
                 material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
                 period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this
                 License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
                 reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses
                 granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
                 termination.
            &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.1&lt;/var&gt;
              If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
                 affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
                 without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
                 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.2&lt;/var&gt;
              CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new
                 version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
                 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it
                 was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may
                 elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
                 other than CA has the right to modify this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.3&lt;/var&gt;
              If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must:
                 (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file
                 described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source
                 code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.4&lt;/var&gt;
              This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal
                 action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient
                 waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute
                 resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State
                 of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue
                 in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The
                 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                 is expressly excluded.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The
                 parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be
                 drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&amp;apos;elles ont exige que le
                 present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.6&lt;/var&gt;
              The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country
                 in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with
                 and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of
                 such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and
                 authorizations.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.7&lt;/var&gt;
              This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
                 matter hereof.
            &lt;/li&gt;

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nLicense Background\n\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\n\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\n\n2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\n\n2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n     * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and\n     * its license agreement:\n          * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n          * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n          * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n          * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.\n\n3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n     * it must be made available under this License; and\n     * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n\n4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\n5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING\n\n7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.\n\n7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.\n\n8. PATENT LITIGATION\n\n8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n9. OWNERSHIP\n\n9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n10. TERMINATION\n\n10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.\n\n11. GENERAL\n\n11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.\n\n11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&#39;elles ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais.\n\n11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and authorizations.\n\n11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n&quot;,

However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the\n                 distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge,\n                 license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this\n                 License to the Program.

It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a\n                 Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to\n                 a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions\n                 on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.4&lt;/var&gt;\n              A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not\n                 governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In\n                 such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are\n                 fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n                 offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other\n                 Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance\n                 warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may\n                 create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n                 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby\n                 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made\n                 Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,\n                 damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions\n                 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\n                 or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor\n                 in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not\n                 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n                 infringement.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.5&lt;/var&gt;\n              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is\n                 required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n                 Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled\n                 ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One\n                 Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at\n                 opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient\n                 detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If\n                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall\n                 also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter\n                 and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n                 reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has\n                 been obtained.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.6&lt;/var&gt;\n              Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent\n                 proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in\n                 any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor\n                 must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that\n                 reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n          CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.1&lt;/var&gt;\n              Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to\n                 contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the\n                 Program and the date of any change.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License\nVersion 1.1\n\nPLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nLicense Background\n\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\n\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\n\n2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\n\n2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n     * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and\n     * its license agreement:\n          * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n          * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n          * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n          * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.\n\n3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n     * it must be made available under this License; and\n     * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n\n4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\n5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING\n\n7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.\n\n7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.\n\n8. PATENT LITIGATION\n\n8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n9. OWNERSHIP\n\n9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n10. TERMINATION\n\n10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.\n\n11. GENERAL\n\n11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.\n\n11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

In\n                 such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are\n                 fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n                 offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other\n                 Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance\n                 warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf.

(CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; DEFINITIONS\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.2\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.3\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.4\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.5\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.6\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.7\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.8\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.2\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.3\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.4\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.1\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; its license agreement:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.2\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; it must be made available under this License; and\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;*\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.3\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.4\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.5\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.6\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation.

Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE
ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER
ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We
believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate
software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and
innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we
are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the
Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and
without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined
below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to
permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License
unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program
must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under
which you may use the Program.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and
(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and
additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the
Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do
not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes
the Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the
Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any
Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions
thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
with the Program.

1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which
this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code,
object code and documentation, if any.

1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the
Program.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1
shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell,
offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section
2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is
granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not
include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance
with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of
Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except
as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with
respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in
Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity
based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,
title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the
right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent
notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related
documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available
from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the
source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in
object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and 
b. its license agreement: 
	i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
	conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
	and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
	merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent
	permitted by applicable law;
	ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
	damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
	damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
	law; 
	iii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
	iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such 
	Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain
	it in a reasonable manner.

3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

a. it must be made available under this License; and 
b. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution
of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge
Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.
Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license
fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights
under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source
code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if
any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and
distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a
Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an
attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties
or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with
other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the
Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may
subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual
commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and
non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No
Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)
who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial
Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of
such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)
include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates
International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York
11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both
describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such
matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is
made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES
file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such
new knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other
Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the
Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any
documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4,
each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor
provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the
Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of
any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement
that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the
Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the
prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the
Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or
ownership of the Program.

5. NO WARRANTY

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY,
REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY,
PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY
CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS,
UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use
in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation,
communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the
failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
physical or environmental damage.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any
rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted
at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service
marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or
to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any
Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of
the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or
promote products derived from the Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under
trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided
that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.

8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then
such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1
and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest
in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all
rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any
Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA
Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may,
at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under
this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License
or may choose not to license them at all.

10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under
this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients
obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as
a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
termination.

11. GENERAL

11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License
from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which

Thus, only your Contributions to the Program\nmust be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under\nwhich you may use the Program.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and\n(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and\nadditions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the\nProgram originate from and are distributed by that particular\nContributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\nitself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf.

Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.

      1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

      1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.

      1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

      1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

      1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

      1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

      2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

      3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

         * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and

         * its license agreement:

         * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;

However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

      3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License\n\nVersion 1.1\n\nPLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nLicense Background\n\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.\n\n   1. DEFINITIONS\n\n      1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n      1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n      1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\n\n      1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n      1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n      1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n      1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n      1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.\n\n   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n      2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\n\n      2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\n\n      2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n      2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\n\n   3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n      3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n         * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and\n\n         * its license agreement:\n\n         * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n\n         * effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\n\n         * states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n         * states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.\n\n      3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n         * it must be made available under this License; and\n\n         * a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n      3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n      3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n\n      3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n      3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n   4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n\n      4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\n\n   5. NO WARRANTY\n\n      5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n      5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n      5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n\n   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n      6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING\n\n      7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.\n\n      7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.\n\n   8. PATENT LITIGATION\n\n      8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   9. OWNERSHIP\n\n      9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n   10. TERMINATION\n\n      10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.\n\n   11. GENERAL\n\n      11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n      11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.\n\n      11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n      11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n      11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n      3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n\n      3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n      3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n   4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n\n      4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\n\n   5. NO WARRANTY\n\n      5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n      5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n      5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n\n   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n      6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING\n\n      7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.\n\n      7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.\n\n   8. PATENT LITIGATION\n\n      8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   9. OWNERSHIP\n\n      9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n   10. TERMINATION\n\n      10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.\n\n   11. GENERAL\n\n      11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n      11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.\n\n      11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n      11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n      11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu&#39;elles ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais.\n\n      11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and authorizations.\n\n      11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.&quot;,
