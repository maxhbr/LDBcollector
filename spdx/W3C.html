Notes

This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

This formulation of W3C&#39;s notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of &quot;use&quot;. Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation&#39;s assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI&#39;s certification under the Open Source Definition.

Status: This license was applied to software published by W3C before 13 May,

license and applied the new license to all W3C documents that had previously
been made available under this license. The new license grants all permissions
that had been granted under this 2002 license.

Notes

This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

This formulation of W3C&#39;s notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is
now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
license, and removes the ambiguous grant of &quot;use&quot;. Otherwise, this version is
the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
Software Foundation&#39;s assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI&#39;s certification
under the Open Source Definition.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{
