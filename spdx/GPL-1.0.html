Version 1, February 1989

Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.

     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 1, February 1989
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep
      users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free
      Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to
      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and
        a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any
        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
          or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence
        of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
        copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You
          may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
          of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,
            either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this General
            Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty
            protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to
            print or display an announcement including an appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
            the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            You may charge a fee for the physical act of
            transferring a copy, and you may at your option
            offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or
          its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
          does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion
        or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
          2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
            three years, to give any third party free (except for a
            nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the information you received as to where the
            corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from
        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of
          this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
          restrictions on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
          software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
          WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
          PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
          THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
          OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and a brief idea
        of what it does.&amp;gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it
        and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
        either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

        could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
        or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot; for

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep
      users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free
      Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to
      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.

      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and
        a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any
        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
        or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence
        of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
        copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You
        may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
        of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,
            either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this General
            Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty
            protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to
            print or display an announcement including an appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
            the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            You may charge a fee for the physical act of
            transferring a copy, and you may at your option
            offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or
          its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
          does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion
        or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
        2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
            three years, to give any third party free (except for a
            nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the information you received as to where the
            corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from
        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of
        this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
          WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
          PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
          THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and a brief idea
        of what it does.&amp;gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it
        and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
        either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
        you use may be called something other than `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos;; they
        could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
        or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot; for
        the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
                            Preamble
 
  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
 
  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:
 
    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and
 
    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.
 
    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.
 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.
 

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 
    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 
    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 
    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.
 
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.
 
  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
 

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
 
  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 
                            NO WARRANTY
 
  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA
 

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

Version 1, February 1989

Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.

     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

     &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep
      users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share

      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free
      Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software and to any other program whose

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to
      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.

&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and
        a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any
        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
          or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence
        of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
        copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You
          may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
          of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,
            either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this General
            Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty
            protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to
            print or display an announcement including an appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
            the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            You may charge a fee for the physical act of
            transferring a copy, and you may at your option
            offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or
          its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
          does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion
        or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
          2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
            three years, to give any third party free (except for a
            nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the information you received as to where the
            corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from
        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of
          this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
          restrictions on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and a brief idea
        of what it does.&amp;gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it
        and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
        either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
        you use may be called something other than `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos;; they
        could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
        or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot; for
        the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based on the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n\n     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any later version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.

For an executable file, complete\n          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;\n          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for\n          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating\n          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header\n          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\n        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public\n        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\n        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically\n        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,\n        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from\n        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses\n          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any\n        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of\n          this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\n        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\n          restrictions on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such\n        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies\n          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following\n          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\n          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\n          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose\n          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n          software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          NO WARRANTY\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based on the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n\n     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any later version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n     &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it!\n&quot;,

By contrast, our General\n      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share\n      and change free software--to make sure the software is free for\n      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free\n      Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software and to any other program whose\n      authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to\n      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\n      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if\n      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\n      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\n      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\n      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\n      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\n      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make\n      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\n      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else\n      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\n      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\n      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n      distribution and modification follow.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\n        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may\n        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\n        The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and\n        a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any\n        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\n          or with modifications.

Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.

     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 1, February 1989
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51
      Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep
      users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free
      Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to
      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and
        a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any
        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
        or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence
        of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
        copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You
        may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
        of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,
            either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this General
            Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty
            protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to
            print or display an announcement including an appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
            the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            You may charge a fee for the physical act of
            transferring a copy, and you may at your option
            offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or
          its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
          does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion
        or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
        2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
            three years, to give any third party free (except for a
            nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            accompany it with the information you received as to where the
            corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from
        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of
        this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
          WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
          PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
          THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        If the program is interactive, make it output a short

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based on the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n\n     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any later version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n     &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it!\n&quot;,

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based on the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n\n     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any later version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If the\n          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies\n          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following\n          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\n          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\n          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose\n          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      \n&lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          NO WARRANTY\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based on the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program.

(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any later version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it!\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
                            Preamble
 
  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
 
  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:
 
    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and
 
    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.
 
    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.
 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.
 

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 
    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 
    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 
    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.
 
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.
 
  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
 

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
 
  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 
                            NO WARRANTY
 
  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA
 

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
 
The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show
c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

By contrast, our General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\n \n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n \n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n \n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n \n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n \n  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors&#39; reputations.\n \n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n \n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n \n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based\non the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n \n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n \n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n \n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n \n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n \n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n \nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n \n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n \n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n \nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n \n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n \n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n \n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n \n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any\nlater version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n \n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n \n                            NO WARRANTY\n \n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n \n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n \n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based\non the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n \n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n \n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n \n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n \n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n \n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n \nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n \n\n  3.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n \n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any\nlater version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n \n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n \n                            NO WARRANTY\n \n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n \n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n \n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show
c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

By contrast, our General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors&#39; reputations.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based\non the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n\n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any\nlater version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show\nc&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\nprogram.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes\n  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it!&quot;,

By contrast, our General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\n \n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n \n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n \n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n \n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n \n  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors&#39; reputations.\n \n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n \n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n \n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based\non the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n \n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n \n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n \n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n \n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n \n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n \nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n \n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n \n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n \n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n \nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n \n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n \n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n \n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n \n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any\nlater version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n \n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n \n                            NO WARRANTY\n \n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n \n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n \n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n \n    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;\n \n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n \n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show\nc&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\nprogram.\n \nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if\nnecessary.

 Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#39; reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show
c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision&#39; (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That&#39;s all there is to it!

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n\n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n\u000c\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\u000c\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \&quot;any\nlater version\&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\u000c\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

By contrast, our General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&#39;s\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors&#39; reputations.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\u000c\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\&quot;Program\&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \&quot;work based\non the Program\&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.
