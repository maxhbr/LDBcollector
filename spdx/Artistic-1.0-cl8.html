Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The End

      &lt;p&gt;Preamble&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the
         Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
         while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
         customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Package&amp;quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Standard Version&amp;quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Copyright Holder&amp;quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot; is you, if you&amp;apos;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reasonable copying fee&amp;quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Freely Available&amp;quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.&lt;/p&gt;

          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
             Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices
             and associated disclaimers.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
             or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
             Standard Version.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a
             prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided
             that you do at least ONE of the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
                 as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
                 modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
                 Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables,

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from
the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package.

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted
provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt
attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the
commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from
the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package.

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted
provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt
attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the
commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of
this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

      c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

   8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

   9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

   10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The End</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{
