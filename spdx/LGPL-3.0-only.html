Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

   0. Additional Definitions.

      As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

      &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

      An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

      A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

      The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

      The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

   5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.

   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.

   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

   1. Source Code.

   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source form of a work.

   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   7. Additional Terms.

   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

   8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   11. Patents.

   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.

   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

   14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
         not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3
         of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Definitions.
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public
                 License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
                 License.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
                 Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
                 but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the
                 Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the
                 Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also
                 called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source
                 for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that,
                 considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or
                 source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for
                 reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
                 Combined Work.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by
                 section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Versions.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a
                 function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than
                 as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the
                 modified version:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
                 an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
                 performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is
                 part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice,
                 provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters,
                 data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
                 (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and
                 that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Combined Works.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively
                 do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined
                 Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
                 the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
                 that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright
                 notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
                 the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Do one of the following:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the
                     Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                     the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
                     Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
                     the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
                     mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on
                     the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                     of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such
                 information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information
                 is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
                 recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
                 (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
                 Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
                 provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                 for conveying Corresponding Source.)
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Combined Libraries.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a
                 single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and
                 are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
                 your choice, if you do both of the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
                 with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
                 Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
                 work.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
          &lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
             License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
             differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a
             certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot;
             applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
             version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
             received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
             any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software
             Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
             Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of any version
             is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

           Version 3, 29 June 2007
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
           &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Preamble
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
           license for software and other kinds of works.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
           take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
           General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
           change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
           for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
           Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
           released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
           price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
           have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
           for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
           if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
           it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
           these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
           certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
           if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
           or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
           you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
           source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
           (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
           giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
           explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
           both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
           versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
           not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
           versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
           do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
           users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
           such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
           which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
           designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
           products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
           we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
           versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
           States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
           software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
           to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
           could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
           assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
         &lt;/p&gt;

           The precise terms and conditions for copying,
           distribution and modification follow.

             Definitions.
             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
               to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
               this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
               and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
               work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
               making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
               version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
               Program or a work based on the Program.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
               permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
               infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
               on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
               copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
               to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
               that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
               Mere interaction with a user through a computer
               network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
               to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
               feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
               tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
               the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
               the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
               If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
               such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
             Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

             The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
             form of the work for making modifications to it.
             &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
               standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
               of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
               one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
               than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
               of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
               Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
               Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
               implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
               &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
               (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
               (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
               produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
               the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
               work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
               to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
               System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
               free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
               but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
               Source includes interface definition files associated with source
               files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
               and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
               designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
               control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
               regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The Corresponding Source for a work
               in source code form is that same work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
             Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

             All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
             copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
             conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
             permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
             covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
             content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
             rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
             &lt;p&gt;
               You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
               without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
               You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
               them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
               facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
               the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
               not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
               for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
               and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
               of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
               solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
               is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
             Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

             No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
             measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
             11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
             similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
             &lt;p&gt;
               When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
               forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
               such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
               License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
               intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
               of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
               legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
             you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
             and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
             notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
             non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
             code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
             give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
             &lt;p&gt;
               You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
               convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
             produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
             of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
             
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 The work must carry prominent notices stating
                 that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 The work must carry prominent notices stating that
                 it is released under this License and any conditions
                 added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
                 requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
                 to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
                 will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                 regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
                 permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                 invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
                 display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
                 has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
                 Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
               works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
               work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
               program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
               is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
               copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
               of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
               permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
               cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey a covered work in object code form
             under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
             also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
             under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
             
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
                 product (including a physical distribution medium),
                 accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
                 physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                 (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                 written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
                 as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
                 product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
                 either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
                 in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
                 physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
                 for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
                 performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
                 the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey individual copies of the object code with a
                 copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
                 Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
                 and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
                 code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
                 (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                 Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
                 no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
                 Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
                 to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
                 Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
                 party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
                 maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
                 to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
                 the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
                 is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
                 provided you inform other peers where the object code
                 and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
                 to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
               excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
               need not be included in conveying the object code work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
               any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
               family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
               for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
               is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
               of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
               user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
               class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
               user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
               or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
               consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
               commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
               represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
               procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
               to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
               that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
               Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
               functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
               or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
               or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
               occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
               and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
               perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
               is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
               section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
               But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
               party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
               User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
               include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
               warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
               or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
               which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
               may be denied when the modification itself materially and
               adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
               the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
               provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
               is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
               to the public in source code form), and must require no
               special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
             Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

             &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
             License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
             Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
             shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
             the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
             permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
             separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
             governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
             &lt;p&gt;
               When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
               remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
               of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
               removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
               additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
               for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
               add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
               of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
             &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
                 from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
                 notices or author attributions in that material or in the
                 Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
                 or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
                 in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
                 of licensors or authors of the material; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
                 of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                 material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
                 versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
                 to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
                 assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
               restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
               as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
               that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
               a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
               document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
               conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
               governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
               further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
               section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
               statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
               or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
               stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
               as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
             Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
             expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
             to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
             terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
             licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
             &lt;p&gt;
               However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
               license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
               provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
               and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
               the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
               some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
               reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
               of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
               time you have received notice of violation of this License
               (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
               violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Termination of your rights under this section does not
               terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
               rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
               terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
               to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
             Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

             You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
             run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
             occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
             to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
             nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
             or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
             do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
             covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
             Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

             Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
             receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
             propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
             for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
             &lt;p&gt;
               An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
               an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
               an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
               covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
               transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
               licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
               give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
               Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
               if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
               rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
               may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
               of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
               litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
               alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
               offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
             Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

             A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
             License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
             work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
             &lt;p&gt;
               A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
               claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
               acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
               manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
               its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
               be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
               of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
               &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
               patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
               to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
               modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
               express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
               enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
               a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
               &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
               agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
               and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
               to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
               a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
               means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
               be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
               of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
               the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
               means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
               conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
               the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
               patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
               arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
               of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
               parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
               propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
               then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
               to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
               scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
               on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
               granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
               you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
               business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
               the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
               the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
               parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
               patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
               conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
               for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
               contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
               or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
               limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
               that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
             No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

             If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
             or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
             they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
             you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
             your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
             obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
             For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
             a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
             Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
             License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
             Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
             permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
             under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
             a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
             terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
             is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
             Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
             through a network will apply to the combination as such.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
             Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

             The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
             versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
             new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
             but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
             &lt;p&gt;
               Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
               Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
               General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
               you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
               of that numbered version or of any later version published by
               the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
               version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
               any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
               versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
               proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
               authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Later license versions may give you additional or
               different permissions. However, no additional obligations
               are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
               result of your choosing to follow a later version.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;

             Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

             THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
             APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
             HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
             WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
             LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
             A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
             OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
             ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
           &lt;/li&gt;

             Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

             IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
             WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
             CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
             INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
             ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
             BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
             OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
             PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
             OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
           &lt;/li&gt;

             Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
         &lt;p&gt;
           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
           provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
           their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
           closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
           connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
           liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
         &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;/ul&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
             of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
             way to achieve this is to make it free software which
             everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
             to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
             state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
             the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
             a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

             Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
             modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
             as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
             3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
             useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
             warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             You should have received a copy of the GNU General
       Public License along with this program. If not, see
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
             short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
       &amp;lt;program&amp;gt; Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

             This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
             WARRANTY; for details type `show w&amp;apos;.&lt;br /&gt;

             This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
             it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
             show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
             Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
             for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             You should also get your employer (if you work as a
             programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
             for the program, if necessary. For more information on
       this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
             your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
             subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
             linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
             is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
       License instead of this License. But first, please read
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; licenses&lt;/var&gt;/why-not-lgpl.html&amp;gt;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.

A contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
      the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
      License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Additional Definitions.
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of
              the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot;
              refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              &amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
              other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface
              provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
              Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
              is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or
              linking an Application with the Library. The particular
              version of the Library with which the Combined
              Work was made is also called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
              Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
              Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based
              on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the object code and/or source code for the
              Application, including any data and utility programs needed
              for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application,
              but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
        License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
        modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
        to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
        (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            under this License, provided that you make a good faith
            effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
            supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
            performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
            permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /&gt;

        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the object
            code that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the object code with a copy of
            the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Works.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined
            Work that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
            of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
            among these notices, as well as a reference directing the
            user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Do one of the following:
            
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
                of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
                in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                the user to recombine or relink the Application with
                a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
                modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
                6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
              &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
                with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
                (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
                present on the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will
                operate properly with a modified version of the Library
                that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
              &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
            GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
            install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced
            by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version
            of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
            Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
            Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
            provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
            section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Libraries.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may place library facilities that are a work based on
        the Library side by side in a single library together with
        other library facilities that are not Applications and are not
        covered by this License, and convey such a combined library
        under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
            of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
            to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
          as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
          GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies
          to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that published version or of any later version published
          by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it
          does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
          License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
          Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy
          can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public
          statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
          authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Preamble
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
        license for software and other kinds of works.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
        take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The precise terms and conditions for copying,
        distribution and modification follow.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
            this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
            and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
            work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
            making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
            Program or a work based on the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
            Mere interaction with a user through a computer
            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
          form of the work for making modifications to it.
          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
            Source includes interface definition files associated with source
            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source for a work
            in source code form is that same work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
          content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
          rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
            without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
            You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
            them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
            facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
            not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
            of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
            solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
            is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
          measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
          11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
            forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
            such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
            License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
            intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
            of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
            legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
          you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
          and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
          notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
          non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
          code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
          give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
            convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
          produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
          of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating
              that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating that
              it is released under this License and any conditions
              added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
              requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
              to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
              will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
              additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
              regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
            permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
            cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a covered work in object code form
          under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
          also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
          under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
              product (including a physical distribution medium),
              accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
              written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
              as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
              product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
              either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
              in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
              for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
              performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
              the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey individual copies of the object code with a
              copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
              Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
              and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
              code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
              (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
              no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
              to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
              Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
              party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
              maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
              to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
              provided you inform other peers where the object code
              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
            need not be included in conveying the object code work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
            may be denied when the modification itself materially and
            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
            to the public in source code form), and must require no
            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
              notices or author attributions in that material or in the
              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
              of licensors or authors of the material; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
          &lt;p&gt;
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
            time you have received notice of violation of this License
            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Termination of your rights under this section does not
            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
          &lt;p&gt;
            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
          through a network will apply to the combination as such.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          &lt;p&gt;
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
            of that numbered version or of any later version published by
            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Later license versions may give you additional or
            different permissions. However, no additional obligations
            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
            result of your choosing to follow a later version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
          HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
          OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
          CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
          OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
          PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
          OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 17.&lt;/var&gt;
          Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
      &lt;p&gt;
        If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
        their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
        closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
        connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
        liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
      &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
        &lt;p&gt;
          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
          of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
          way to achieve this is to make it free software which
          everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
          to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
          state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
          the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
          a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
          modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
          as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
          3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
          useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
          warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You should have received a copy of the GNU General
    Public License along with this program. If not, see
    &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
          short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;lt;program&amp;gt; Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
          WARRANTY; for details type `show w&amp;apos;.&lt;br /&gt;

          This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
          it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
          show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
          Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
          for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a
          programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
          for the program, if necessary. For more information on
    this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
    &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
          your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
          subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
          linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
          is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
    License instead of this License. But first, please read
    &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; licenses&lt;/var&gt;/why-not-lgpl.html&amp;gt;.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

version:
 
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.
 
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
 
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 
  4. Combined Works.
 
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
 
   d) Do one of the following:
 
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.
 
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.
 
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
 
  5. Combined Libraries.
 
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:
 
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.
 
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.

b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

d) Do one of the following:

0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.

1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

      The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

      The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

   5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.

   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.

   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

   1. Source Code.

   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source form of a work.

   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   7. Additional Terms.

   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

   8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   11. Patents.

   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.

   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

   14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

        &lt;br /&gt;

Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
         not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3
         of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Definitions.
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public
                 License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
                 License.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
                 Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
                 but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the
                 Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the
                 Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also
                 called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source
                 for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that,
                 considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or
                 source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for
                 reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
                 Combined Work.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by
                 section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Versions.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a
                 function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than
                 as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the
                 modified version:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
                 an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
                 performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is
                 part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice,
                 provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters,
                 data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
                 (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and
                 that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Combined Works.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively
                 do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined
                 Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
                 the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
                 that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright
                 notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
                 the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Do one of the following:
              
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the
                     Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                     the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
                     Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
                     the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
                     mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on
                     the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                     of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such
                 information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information
                 is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
                 recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
                 (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
                 Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
                 provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                 for conveying Corresponding Source.)
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Combined Libraries.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a
                 single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and
                 are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
                 your choice, if you do both of the following:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
                 with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
                 Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
                 work.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
          &lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
             License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
             differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a
             certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot;
             applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
             version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
             received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
             any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software
             Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
             Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of any version
             is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
           &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Preamble
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
           license for software and other kinds of works.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
           take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
           General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
           change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
           for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
           Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
           released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
           price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
           have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
           for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
           if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
           it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
           these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
           certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
           if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
           or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
           you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
           source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
           (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
           giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
           explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
           both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
           versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
           not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
           versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
           do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
           users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
           such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
           which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
           designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
           products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
           we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
           versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
           States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
           software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
           to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
           could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
           assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
           The precise terms and conditions for copying,
           distribution and modification follow.
         &lt;/p&gt;

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
             Definitions.
             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
               to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
               this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
               and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
               work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
               making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
               version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
               Program or a work based on the Program.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
               permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
               infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
               on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
               copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
               to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
               that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
               Mere interaction with a user through a computer
               network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
               to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
               feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
               tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
               the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
               the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
               If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
               such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
             Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

             The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
             form of the work for making modifications to it.
             &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
               standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
               of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
               one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
               than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
               of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
               Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
               Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
               implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
               &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
               (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
               (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
               produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
               the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
               work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
               to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
               System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
               free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
               but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
               Source includes interface definition files associated with source
               files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
               and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
               designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
               control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
               regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The Corresponding Source for a work
               in source code form is that same work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
             Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

             All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
             copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
             conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
             permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
             covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
             content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
             rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
             &lt;p&gt;
               You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
               without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
               You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
               them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
               facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
               the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
               not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
               for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
               and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
               of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
               solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
               is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
             Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

             No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
             measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
             11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
             similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
             &lt;p&gt;
               When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
               forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
               such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
               License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
               intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
               of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
               legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
             you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
             and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
             notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
             non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
             code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
             give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
             &lt;p&gt;
               You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
               convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
             produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
             of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
             
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 The work must carry prominent notices stating
                 that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 The work must carry prominent notices stating that
                 it is released under this License and any conditions
                 added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
                 requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
                 to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
                 will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                 regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
                 permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                 invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
                 display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
                 has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
                 Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
               works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
               work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
               program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
               is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
               copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
               of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
               permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
               cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
             Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may convey a covered work in object code form
             under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
             also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
             under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
             
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
                 product (including a physical distribution medium),
                 accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
                 physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                 (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                 written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
                 as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
                 product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
                 either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
                 in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
                 physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
                 for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
                 performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
                 the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey individual copies of the object code with a
                 copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
                 Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
                 and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
                 code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
                 (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                 Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
                 no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
                 Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
                 to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
                 Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
                 party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
                 maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
                 to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
                 the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
                 is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
                 provided you inform other peers where the object code
                 and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
                 to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
               excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
               need not be included in conveying the object code work.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
               any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
               family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
               for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
               is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
               of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
               user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
               class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
               user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
               or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
               consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
               commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
               represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
               procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
               to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
               that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
               Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
               functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
               or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
               or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
               occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
               and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
               perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
               is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
               section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
               But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
               party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
               User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
               include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
               warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
               or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
               which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
               may be denied when the modification itself materially and
               adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
               the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
               provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
               is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
               to the public in source code form), and must require no
               special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
             Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

             &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
             License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
             Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
             shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
             the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
             permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
             separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
             governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
             &lt;p&gt;
               When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
               remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
               of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
               removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
               additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
               for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
               add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
               of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
             &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
                 from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
                 notices or author attributions in that material or in the
                 Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
                 or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
                 in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
                 of licensors or authors of the material; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
                 of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                 &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
                 Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                 material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
                 versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
                 to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
                 assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
               &lt;/li&gt;
             
&lt;/ul&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
               All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
               restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
               as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
               that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
               a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
               document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
               conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
               governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
               further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
               section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
               statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
               or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
               stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
               as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
             Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

             You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
             expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
             to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
             terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
             licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
             &lt;p&gt;
               However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
               license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
               provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
               and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
               the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
               some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
               reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
               of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
               time you have received notice of violation of this License
               (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
               violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Termination of your rights under this section does not
               terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
               rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
               terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
               to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
             Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

             You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
             run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
             occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
             to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
             nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
             or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
             do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
             covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
             Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

             Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
             receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
             propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
             for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
             &lt;p&gt;
               An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
               an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
               an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
               covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
               transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
               licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
               give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
               Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
               if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
               rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
               may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
               of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
               litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
               alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
               offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
             Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

             A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
             License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
             work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
             &lt;p&gt;
               A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
               claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
               acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
               manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
               its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
               be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
               of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
               &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
               patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
               to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
               modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
               express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
               enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
               a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
               &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
               agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
               and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
               to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
               a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
               means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
               be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
               of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
               the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
               means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
               conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
               the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
               patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
               arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
               of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
               parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
               propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
               then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
               to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
               scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
               on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
               granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
               you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
               business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
               the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
               the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
               parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
               patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
               conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
               for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
               contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
               or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
               limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
               that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
             No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

             If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
             or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
             they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
             you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
             your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
             obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
             For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
             a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
             Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
             License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
           &lt;/li&gt;

             Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
             permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
             under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
             a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
             terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
             is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
             Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
             through a network will apply to the combination as such.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;li&gt;
             &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
             Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

             The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
             versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
             new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
             but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
             &lt;p&gt;
               Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
               Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
               General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
               you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
               of that numbered version or of any later version published by
               the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
               version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
               any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
               versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
               proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
               authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
             &lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;p&gt;
               Later license versions may give you additional or
               different permissions. However, no additional obligations
               are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
               result of your choosing to follow a later version.
             &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;

             Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

             THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
             APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
             HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
             WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
             LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
             A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
             OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
             ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
           &lt;/li&gt;

             Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

             IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
             WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
             CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
             INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
             ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
             BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
             OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
             PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
             OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

             Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
         &lt;p&gt;
           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
           provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
           their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
           closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
           connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
           liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
         &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;/li&gt;

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
             of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
             way to achieve this is to make it free software which
             everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
             to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
             state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
             the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
             a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

             Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
             modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
             as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
             3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
             useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
             warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             You should have received a copy of the GNU General
       Public License along with this program. If not, see
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
             short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;

             WARRANTY; for details type `show w&amp;apos;.&lt;br /&gt;

             This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
             it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
             show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
             Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
             for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             You should also get your employer (if you work as a
             programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
             for the program, if necessary. For more information on
       this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
           &lt;/p&gt;

           &lt;p&gt;
             The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
             your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
             subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
             linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
             is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
       License instead of this License. But first, please read
       &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; licenses&lt;/var&gt;/why-not-lgpl.html&amp;gt;.

Additional Definitions.\n\n      As used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n      \&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n      An \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   4. Combined Works.\n\n   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      d) Do one of the following:\n\n         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n   5. Combined Libraries.\n\n   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   7. Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n           General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n           change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n           for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n           Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n           released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n           price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n           have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n           for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n           if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n           it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n           these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n           certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n           if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n           or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n           you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n           source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n           (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n           giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n           explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n           both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n           versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n           not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n           versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n           do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n           users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n           such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n           which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n           designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n           products.

For a particular product received by a particular\n               user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that\n               class of product, regardless of the status of the particular\n               user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\n               or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a\n               consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n               commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n               represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n               procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n               to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n               that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n               Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n               functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n               or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n               or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n               occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n               and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n               perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n               is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n               section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n               But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n               party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n               User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n               include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n               warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n               or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n               which it has been modified or installed.

(Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n               removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)

If a license\n               document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n               conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n               governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n               further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n               section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n               statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n               or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n               stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n               as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n             expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n             to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n             terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n             licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n               license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n               provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n               and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n               the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n               some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n               reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n               of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n               time you have received notice of violation of this License\n               (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n               violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Termination of your rights under this section does not\n               terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n               rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n               terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n               to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n             run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n             occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n             to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n             nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n             or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n             do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n             covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n             receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n             propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n             for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n               an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n               an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n               covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n               transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n               licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n               give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n               Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n               if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n               rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n               may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n               of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n               litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n               alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n               offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n             License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n             work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n               claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n               acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n               manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n               its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n               be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n               of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n               &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n               patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n               to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n               modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n               express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n               enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n               a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n               &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n               agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n               and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n               to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n               a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n               means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n               be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n               of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n               the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n               means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n               conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n               the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n               patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n               arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n               of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n               parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n               propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n               then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n               to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n               scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n               on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n               granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n               you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n               business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n               the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n               the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n               parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n               patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n               conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n               for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n               contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n               or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n               limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n               that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n             No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n             or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n             they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n             you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n             your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n             obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n             For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n             a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n             Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n             License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n             permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n             under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n             a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n             terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n             is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n             Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n             through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n             versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n             new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n             but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n               Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n               General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n               you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n               of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n               the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n               version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n               any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n               versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n               proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n               authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Later license versions may give you additional or\n               different permissions. However, no additional obligations\n               are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\n               result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n             APPLICABLE LAW.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n   0. Additional Definitions.\n\n      As used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n      \&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n      An \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   4. Combined Works.\n\n   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      d) Do one of the following:\n\n         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n   5. Combined Libraries.\n\n   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   7. Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&quot;,

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n           have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n           for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n           if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n           it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n           these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n           certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n           if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n           or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n           you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n           source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n           (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n           giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n           explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n           both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n           versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n           not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n           versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n           do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n           users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n           such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n           which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n           designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n           products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n           we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n           versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n           States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n           software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n           to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n           could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n           assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n           distribution and modification follow.\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n         &lt;p&gt;\n           TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Definitions.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n               to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n               this License.

The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified\n               version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified\n               Program or a work based on the Program.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without\n               permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n               infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\n               on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\n               copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\n               to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation\n               that enables other parties to make or receive copies.\n               Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n               network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;\n               to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n               feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n               tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\n               the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\n               the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\n               If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\n               such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred\n             form of the work for making modifications to it.\n             &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official\n               standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\n               of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\n               one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other\n               than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\n               of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n               Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n               Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n               implementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n               &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n               (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n               (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n               produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n               the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n               work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n               to control those activities.

For example, Corresponding\n               Source includes interface definition files associated with source\n               files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries\n               and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\n               designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n               control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n               regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The Corresponding Source for a work\n               in source code form is that same work.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n             copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n             conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n             permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\n             covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n             content, constitutes a covered work.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally\n                 and noncommercially, and only if you received the object\n                 code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                 &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n                 Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n                 (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n                 Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at\n                 no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n                 Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place\n                 to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding\n                 Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third\n                 party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you\n                 maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where\n                 to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts\n                 the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it\n                 is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                 &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n                 Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n                 provided you inform other peers where the object code\n                 and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered\n                 to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n             \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\n               excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,\n               need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means\n               any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\n               family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold\n               for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product\n               is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor\n               of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular\n               user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that\n               class of product, regardless of the status of the particular\n               user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\n               or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a\n               consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n               commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n               represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n               procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n               to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n               that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n               Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n               functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n               or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n               or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n               occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n               and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n               perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n               is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n               section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n               But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n               party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n               User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n               include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n               warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n               or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n               which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network\n               may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n               adversely affects the operation of the network or violates\n               the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\n               provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that\n               is publicly documented (and with an implementation available\n               to the public in source code form), and must require no\n               special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this\n             License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n             Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\n             shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to\n             the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\n             permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n             separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n             governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n               remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n               of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n               removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)

If a license\n               document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n               conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n               governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n               further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n               section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n               statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n               or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n               stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n               as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n             expressly provided under this License.

If your rights have been\n               terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n               to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n             run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n             occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n             to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n             nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n             or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n             do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n             covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n             receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n             propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n             for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n               an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n               an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n               covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n               transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n               licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n               give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n               Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n               if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n               rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n               may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n               of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n               litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n               alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n               offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n             License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n             work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n               claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n               acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n               manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n               its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n               be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n               of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n               &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n               patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n               to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n               modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n               express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n               enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n               a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n               &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n               agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n               and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n               to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n               a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n               means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n               be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n               of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n               a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n               the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n               means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n               conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n               the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n               patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n               arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n               of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n               parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n               propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n               then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n               to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n               scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n               on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n               granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n               you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n               business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n               the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n               the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n               parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n               patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n               conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n               for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n               contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n               or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n             &lt;p&gt;\n               Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n               limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n               that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n             No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n             or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n             they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

The\n             terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n             is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n             Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n             through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n           &lt;/li&gt;\n           \n&lt;li&gt;\n             &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n             Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n             The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n             versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.

The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Combined Works.\n\n   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Do one of the following:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.

(If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Combined Libraries.\n\n   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;14.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;15.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;16.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;17.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;philicenses\&quot;;original=\&quot;licenses\&quot;;match=\&quot;philosophy|licenses\&quot;&gt;&gt; /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.

A contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

              As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of
              the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot;
              refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              &amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
              other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface
              provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
              Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
              is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or
              linking an Application with the Library. The particular
              version of the Library with which the Combined
              Work was made is also called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
              Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
              Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based
              on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the object code and/or source code for the
              Application, including any data and utility programs needed
              for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application,
              but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
        License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      &lt;/li&gt;

        Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
        modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
        to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
        (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            under this License, provided that you make a good faith
            effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
            supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
            performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
            permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /&gt;

        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the object
            code that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the object code with a copy of
            the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Works.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined
            Work that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
            of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
            among these notices, as well as a reference directing the
            user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Do one of the following:
            
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
                of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
                in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                the user to recombine or relink the Application with
                a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
                modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
                6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
              &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
                with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
                (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
                present on the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will
                operate properly with a modified version of the Library
                that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
              &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
            GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
            install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced
            by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version
            of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
            Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
            Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
            provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
            section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Libraries.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may place library facilities that are a work based on
        the Library side by side in a single library together with
        other library facilities that are not Applications and are not
        covered by this License, and convey such a combined library
        under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
            of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
            to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
          as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
          GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies
          to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that published version or of any later version published
          by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it
          does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
          License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
          Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy
          can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public
          statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
          authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Preamble
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
        license for software and other kinds of works.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
        take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The precise terms and conditions for copying,
        distribution and modification follow.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
            this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
            and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
            work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
            making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
            Program or a work based on the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
            Mere interaction with a user through a computer
            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
          form of the work for making modifications to it.
          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
            Source includes interface definition files associated with source
            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source for a work
            in source code form is that same work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
          content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
          rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
            without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
            You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
            them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
            facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
            not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
            of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
            solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
            is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
          measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
          11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
            forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
            such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
            License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
            intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
            of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
            legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
          you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
          and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
          notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
          non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
          code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
          give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
            convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
          produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
          of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating
              that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating that
              it is released under this License and any conditions
              added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
              requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
              to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
              will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
              additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
              regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
            permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
            cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a covered work in object code form
          under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
          also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
          under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
              product (including a physical distribution medium),
              accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
              written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
              as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
              product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
              either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
              in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
              for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
              performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
              the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey individual copies of the object code with a
              copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
              Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
              and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
              code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
              (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
              no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
              to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
              Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
              party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
              maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
              to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
              provided you inform other peers where the object code
              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
            need not be included in conveying the object code work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
            may be denied when the modification itself materially and
            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
            to the public in source code form), and must require no
            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
              notices or author attributions in that material or in the
              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
              of licensors or authors of the material; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
          &lt;p&gt;
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
            time you have received notice of violation of this License
            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Termination of your rights under this section does not
            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
          &lt;p&gt;
            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
          through a network will apply to the combination as such.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          &lt;p&gt;
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
            of that numbered version or of any later version published by
            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Later license versions may give you additional or
            different permissions. However, no additional obligations
            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
            result of your choosing to follow a later version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
          HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
          OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
          CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
          OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
          PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
          OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 17.&lt;/var&gt;
          Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
      &lt;p&gt;
        If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
        their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
        closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
        connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
        liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
      &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
          of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
          way to achieve this is to make it free software which
          everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
          to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
          state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
          the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
          a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
          modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
          as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
          3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
          useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
          warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You should have received a copy of the GNU General
    Public License along with this program. If not, see
    &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
          short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;lt;program&amp;gt; Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt;

          WARRANTY; for details type `show w&amp;apos;.&lt;br /&gt;

          This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
          it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
          show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
          Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
          for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a
          programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
          for the program, if necessary. For more information on
    this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
          your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
          subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
          linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
          is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
    License instead of this License. But first, please read
    &amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; licenses&lt;/var&gt;/why-not-lgpl.html&amp;gt;.

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

Propagation includes\n            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\n            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation\n            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.\n            Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;\n            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\n            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\n            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\n            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\n            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred\n          form of the work for making modifications to it.\n          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official\n            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\n            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\n            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other\n            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\n            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n            to control those activities.

For example, Corresponding\n            Source includes interface definition files associated with source\n            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries\n            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\n            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source for a work\n            in source code form is that same work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n          conditions are met.

A product is a\n            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network\n            may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates\n            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\n            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that\n            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available\n            to the public in source code form), and must require no\n            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this\n          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\n          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to\n          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\n              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\n              notices or author attributions in that material or in the\n              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked\n              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names\n              of licensors or authors of the material; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\n              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified\n              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\n              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\n              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further\n            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program\n            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\n            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is\n            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n            time you have received notice of violation of this License\n            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not\n            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions.

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified\n            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified\n            Program or a work based on the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without\n            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\n            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\n            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\n            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation\n            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.\n            Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;\n            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\n            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\n            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\n            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\n            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred\n          form of the work for making modifications to it.\n          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official\n            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\n            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\n            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other\n            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\n            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s\n            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available\n            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities\n            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding\n            Source includes interface definition files associated with source\n            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries\n            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\n            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source for a work\n            in source code form is that same work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\n          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n          content, constitutes a covered work.

Those thus making or running the covered works\n            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies\n            of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted\n            solely under the conditions stated below.

This License gives no\n              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\n              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program\n              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate\n              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered\n            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger\n            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,\n            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting\n            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\n            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works\n            permit.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally\n              and noncommercially, and only if you received the object\n              code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n              (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at\n              no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place\n              to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding\n              Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third\n              party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you\n              maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where\n              to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts\n              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it\n              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n              provided you inform other peers where the object code\n              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered\n              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\n            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,\n            need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means\n            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\n            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold\n            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product\n            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor\n            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular\n            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that\n            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular\n            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\n            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a\n            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n            which it has been modified or installed.

If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\n              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\n              notices or author attributions in that material or in the\n              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked\n              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names\n              of licensors or authors of the material; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\n              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified\n              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\n              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\n              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further\n            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program\n            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\n            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is\n            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n            time you have received notice of violation of this License\n            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not\n            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions. However, no additional obligations\n            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\n            result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n          APPLICABLE LAW.

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;14.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;15.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;16.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;17.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;philicenses\&quot;;original=\&quot;licenses\&quot;;match=\&quot;philosophy|licenses\&quot;&gt;&gt; /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.

A contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
      the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
      License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

        Additional Definitions.
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of
              the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot;
              refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              &amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
              other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface
              provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
              Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
              is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or
              linking an Application with the Library. The particular
              version of the Library with which the Combined
              Work was made is also called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
              Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
              Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based
              on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the object code and/or source code for the
              Application, including any data and utility programs needed
              for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application,
              but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
        License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
        modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
        to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
        (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            under this License, provided that you make a good faith
            effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
            supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
            performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
            permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /&gt;

        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the object
            code that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the object code with a copy of
            the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Works.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined
            Work that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
            of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
            among these notices, as well as a reference directing the
            user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Do one of the following:
            
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
                of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
                in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                the user to recombine or relink the Application with
                a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
                modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
                6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
              &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
                with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
                (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
                present on the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will
                operate properly with a modified version of the Library
                that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
              &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
            GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
            install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced
            by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version
            of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
            Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
            Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
            provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
            section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Libraries.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may place library facilities that are a work based on
        the Library side by side in a single library together with
        other library facilities that are not Applications and are not
        covered by this License, and convey such a combined library
        under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
            of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
            to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
          as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
          GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies
          to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that published version or of any later version published
          by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it
          does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
          License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
          Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy
          can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public
          statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
          authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Preamble
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
        license for software and other kinds of works.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
        take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The precise terms and conditions for copying,
        distribution and modification follow.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
            this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
            and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
            work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
            making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
            Program or a work based on the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
            Mere interaction with a user through a computer
            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
          form of the work for making modifications to it.
          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
            Source includes interface definition files associated with source
            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source for a work
            in source code form is that same work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
          content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
          rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
            without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
            You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
            them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
            facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
            not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
            of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
            solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
            is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
          measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
          11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
            forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
            such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
            License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
            intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
            of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
            legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
          you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
          and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
          notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
          non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
          code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
          give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
            convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
          produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
          of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating
              that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating that
              it is released under this License and any conditions
              added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
              requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
              to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
              will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
              additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
              regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
            permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
            cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a covered work in object code form
          under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
          also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
          under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
              product (including a physical distribution medium),
              accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
              written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
              as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
              product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
              either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
              in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
              for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
              performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
              the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey individual copies of the object code with a
              copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
              Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
              and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
              code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
              (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
              no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
              to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
              Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
              party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
              maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
              to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
              provided you inform other peers where the object code
              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
            need not be included in conveying the object code work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
            may be denied when the modification itself materially and
            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
            to the public in source code form), and must require no
            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
              notices or author attributions in that material or in the
              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
              of licensors or authors of the material; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
          &lt;p&gt;
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
            time you have received notice of violation of this License
            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Termination of your rights under this section does not
            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
          &lt;p&gt;
            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
          through a network will apply to the combination as such.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          &lt;p&gt;
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
            of that numbered version or of any later version published by
            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Later license versions may give you additional or
            different permissions. However, no additional obligations
            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
            result of your choosing to follow a later version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
          HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
          OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
          CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
          OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
          PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
          OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
      &lt;p&gt;
        If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
        their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
        closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
        connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
        liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
      &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
          of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
          way to achieve this is to make it free software which
          everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
          to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
          state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
          the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
          a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
          modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
          as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
          3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
          short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified\n            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified\n            Program or a work based on the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without\n            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\n            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\n            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\n            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation\n            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.\n            Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;\n            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\n            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\n            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\n            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\n            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred\n          form of the work for making modifications to it.\n          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official\n            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\n            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\n            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other\n            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\n            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s\n            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available\n            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities\n            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding\n            Source includes interface definition files associated with source\n            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries\n            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\n            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The Corresponding Source for a work\n            in source code form is that same work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\n          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n          content, constitutes a covered work.

This License gives no\n              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\n              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program\n              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate\n              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered\n            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger\n            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,\n            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting\n            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\n            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works\n            permit.

Regardless of what server hosts\n              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it\n              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n              provided you inform other peers where the object code\n              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered\n              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\n            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,\n            need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means\n            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\n            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold\n            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product\n            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor\n            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular\n            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that\n            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular\n            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\n            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a\n            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n            which it has been modified or installed.

If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)

If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License.

If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions. However, no additional obligations\n            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\n            result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n          APPLICABLE LAW.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n0. Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

Propagation includes\n            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\n            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation\n            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.\n            Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;\n            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\n            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\n            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\n            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\n            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred\n          form of the work for making modifications to it.\n          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official\n            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\n            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\n            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other\n            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\n            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n            implementation is available to the public in source code form.

A product is a\n            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,\n            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\n            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in\n            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented\n            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\n            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\n            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\n            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third\n            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\n            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not\n            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified\n            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in\n            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network\n            may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates\n            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\n            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that\n            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available\n            to the public in source code form), and must require no\n            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this\n          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\n          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to\n          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\n              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\n              notices or author attributions in that material or in the\n              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked\n              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names\n              of licensors or authors of the material; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\n              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified\n              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\n              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\n              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further\n            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program\n            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\n            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is\n            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n            time you have received notice of violation of this License\n            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not\n            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions.

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.

If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;14.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;15.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;16.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;17.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;philicenses\&quot;;original=\&quot;licenses\&quot;;match=\&quot;philosophy|licenses\&quot;&gt;&gt; /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.

A contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
      the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
      License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

        Additional Definitions.
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              As used herein, &amp;quot;this License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of
              the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &amp;quot;GNU GPL&amp;quot;
              refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              &amp;quot;The Library&amp;quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
              other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              An &amp;quot;Application&amp;quot; is any work that makes use of an interface
              provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
              Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
              is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              A &amp;quot;Combined Work&amp;quot; is a work produced by combining or
              linking an Application with the Library. The particular
              version of the Library with which the Combined
              Work was made is also called the &amp;quot;Linked Version&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
              Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
              Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based
              on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              The &amp;quot;Corresponding Application Code&amp;quot; for a Combined
              Work means the object code and/or source code for the
              Application, including any data and utility programs needed
              for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application,
              but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
        License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
        modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
        to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
        (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            under this License, provided that you make a good faith
            effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
            supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
            performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
            permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /&gt;

        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the object
            code that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the object code with a copy of
            the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Works.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined
            Work that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
            of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
            among these notices, as well as a reference directing the
            user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Do one of the following:
            
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0)&lt;/var&gt;
                Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
                of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
                in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit,
                the user to recombine or relink the Application with
                a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
                modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
                6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
              &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1)&lt;/var&gt;
                Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
                with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
                (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
                present on the user&amp;apos;s computer system, and (b) will
                operate properly with a modified version of the Library
                that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
              &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
            GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
            install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced
            by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version
            of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
            Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
            Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
            provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
            section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Combined Libraries.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may place library facilities that are a work based on
        the Library side by side in a single library together with
        other library facilities that are not Applications and are not
        covered by this License, and convey such a combined library
        under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
            of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
            to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
          as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
          GNU Lesser General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies
          to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that published version or of any later version published
          by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it
          does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
          License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
          Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy
          can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License shall apply, that proxy&amp;apos;s public
          statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
          authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Preamble
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
        license for software and other kinds of works.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
        take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The precise terms and conditions for copying,
        distribution and modification follow.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
            this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
            and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
            work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
            making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
            version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
            Program or a work based on the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
            that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
            Mere interaction with a user through a computer
            network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
            the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
            the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
            If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
            such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

          The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
          form of the work for making modifications to it.
          &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
            of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
            one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
            of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
            to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
            free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
            but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
            Source includes interface definition files associated with source
            files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
            and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
            designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
            control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The Corresponding Source for a work
            in source code form is that same work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
          content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
          rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
            without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
            You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
            them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
            facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
            not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
            of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
            solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
            is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
          measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
          11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
            forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
            such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
            License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
            intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
            of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
            legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
          you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
          and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
          notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
          non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
          code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
          give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
          &lt;p&gt;
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
            convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
          produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
          of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating
              that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              The work must carry prominent notices stating that
              it is released under this License and any conditions
              added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
              requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
              to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
              will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
              additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
              regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
              display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
              has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
              Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
            work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
            program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
            is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
            of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
            permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
            cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may convey a covered work in object code form
          under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
          also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
          under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
              product (including a physical distribution medium),
              accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
              written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
              as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
              product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
              either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
              in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
              physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
              for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
              performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
              the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey individual copies of the object code with a
              copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
              Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
              and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
              code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
              (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
              no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
              to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
              Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
              party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
              maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
              to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
              the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
              is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
              provided you inform other peers where the object code
              and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
              to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
            need not be included in conveying the object code work.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
            any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
            family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
            for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
            is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
            of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
            user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
            class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
            user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
            or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
            consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
            represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
            to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
            that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
            or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
            or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
            occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
            and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
            perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
            is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
            section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
            But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
            party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
            User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
            include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
            warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
            or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
            which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
            may be denied when the modification itself materially and
            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
            the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
            is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
            to the public in source code form), and must require no
            special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

          &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
          shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
          the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
          &lt;p&gt;
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
              notices or author attributions in that material or in the
              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
              of licensors or authors of the material; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
          &lt;p&gt;
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
            time you have received notice of violation of this License
            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Termination of your rights under this section does not
            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
          &lt;p&gt;
            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
          &lt;p&gt;
            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
          through a network will apply to the combination as such.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          &lt;p&gt;
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
            of that numbered version or of any later version published by
            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            Later license versions may give you additional or
            different permissions. However, no additional obligations
            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
            result of your choosing to follow a later version.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
          HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
          OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 16.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
          CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
          OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
          PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
          OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
      &lt;p&gt;
        If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
        provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
        their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
        closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
        connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
        liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
      &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
          of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
          way to achieve this is to make it free software which
          everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

        &lt;p&gt;
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
          to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
          state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
          the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
          a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

A\n            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n            to control those activities.

If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\n              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\n              notices or author attributions in that material or in the\n              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked\n              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names\n              of licensors or authors of the material; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\n              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified\n              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\n              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\n              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further\n            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program\n            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\n            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is\n            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n            time you have received notice of violation of this License\n            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not\n            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions. However, no additional obligations\n            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\n            result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n          APPLICABLE LAW.

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\nThe \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n     d) Do one of the following:\n\n           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n&quot;,

By contrast, the GNU\n        General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n        change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\n        for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\n        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\n        released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n        for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n        it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\n        if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n        or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n        you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly\n        explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n        both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n        not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n        versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n        do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n        users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n        such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n        which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n        designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n        products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n        versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n        to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n        could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n        assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n        distribution and modification follow.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Definitions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply\n            to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n            this License.

A\n            &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\n            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all\n            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\n            to control those activities.

If additional\n          permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\n          separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\n          governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n            of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\n              from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\n              notices or author attributions in that material or in the\n              Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked\n              in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names\n              of licensors or authors of the material; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\n              of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified\n              versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\n              to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\n              assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further\n            restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program\n            as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\n            that it is governed by this License along with a term that is\n            a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\n            document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\n            conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material\n            governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the\n            further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this\n            section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a\n            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,\n            or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\n            stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated\n            as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Termination.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\n          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n          to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\n          terminate your rights under this License (including any patent\n          licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n            and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if\n            the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\n            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you\n            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\n            time you have received notice of violation of this License\n            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\n            violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not\n            terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or\n            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\n            terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify\n            to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n          run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n          or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of\n            an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing\n            an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a\n            covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n            licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could\n            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,\n            if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\n            may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise\n            of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,\n            offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Patents.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling\n            its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\n            be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\n            of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,\n            to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,\n            modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any\n            express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n            a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n            agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to\n            be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit\n            of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in\n            a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;\n            means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your\n            conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of\n            the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\n            patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\n            of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the\n            parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n            propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\n            then the patent license you grant is automatically extended\n            to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the\n            scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\n            on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n            granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if\n            you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n            business of distributing software, under which you make payment to\n            the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\n            limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n            that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;\n          No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n          or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\n          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\n          you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\n          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n          obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\n          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\n          a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n          Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\n          a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n          terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\n          is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\n          Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\n          through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n          versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n          new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n            General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,\n            you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\n            of that numbered version or of any later version published by\n            the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n            version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n            any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n            proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n          &lt;p&gt;\n            Later license versions may give you additional or\n            different permissions. However, no additional obligations\n            are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\n            result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n          APPLICABLE LAW.

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;0.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions.\n\n   \&quot;This License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \&quot;Copyright\&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \&quot;The Program\&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \&quot;you\&quot;. \&quot;Licensees\&quot; and \&quot;recipients\&quot; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \&quot;modify\&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \&quot;modified version\&quot; of the earlier work or a work \&quot;based on\&quot; the earlier work.\n\n   A \&quot;covered work\&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \&quot;propagate\&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \&quot;convey\&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices\&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Source Code.\n\n   The \&quot;source code\&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \&quot;Object code\&quot; means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \&quot;Standard Interface\&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \&quot;System Libraries\&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \&quot;Major Component\&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \&quot;Corresponding Source\&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \&quot;keep intact all notices\&quot;.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \&quot;aggregate\&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n   A \&quot;User Product\&quot; is either (1) a \&quot;consumer product\&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \&quot;normally used\&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \&quot;Installation Information\&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.\n\n   \&quot;Additional permissions\&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;e)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;f)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \&quot;further restrictions\&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \&quot;entity transaction\&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Patents.\n\n   A \&quot;contributor\&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s \&quot;contributor version\&quot;.\n\n   A contributor&#39;s \&quot;essential patent claims\&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \&quot;control\&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \&quot;patent license\&quot; is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \&quot;grant\&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \&quot;Knowingly relying\&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \&quot;discriminatory\&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;14.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;15.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;16.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;17.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \&quot;copyright\&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \&quot;about box\&quot;.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \&quot;copyright disclaimer\&quot; for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/ &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;philicenses\&quot;;original=\&quot;licenses\&quot;;match=\&quot;philosophy|licenses\&quot;&gt;&gt; /why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.\n\n&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&quot;

Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
 
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
 
  0. Additional Definitions.
 
  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.
 
  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
 
  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.
 
  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.
 
  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
 
  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
 
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
 
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:
 
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.
 
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
 
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 
  4. Combined Works.
 
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
 
   d) Do one of the following:
 
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.
 
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.
 
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
 
  5. Combined Libraries.
 
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:
 
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.
 
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.

b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

d) Do one of the following:

0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.

1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library. </pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

   0. Additional Definitions.

      

      As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

      

      &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

      

      An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

      

      A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.

      

      The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

      

      The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

   5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

Additional Definitions.\n\n      \n\n      As used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n      \n\n      \&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n      \n\n      An \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n      \n\n      A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked Version\&quot;.\n\n      \n\n      The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n      \n\n      The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\n      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   4. Combined Works.\n\n   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\n      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n      d) Do one of the following:\n\n         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\n         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\n      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n   5. Combined Libraries.\n\n   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.&quot;,

Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-only</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul><li><h5>Providing CSC to end user</h5><p><strong>Description:</strong>Make the corresponding source code available (including modifications):

Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
[...] A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
[GPL]13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.


[LGPL] 
4. d) Do one of the following:

    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
[LGPL] 5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-only</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul><li><h5>Weak Copyleft</h5><p><strong>Description:</strong>Some categories of derivative works or of works based on the Open Source Software must be distributed under the initial license or another license approved by the initial license.</p><p><strong>Metacategory:</strong>IP management</p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p></li></ul></p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p><p><strong>Trigger explanation:</strong>DistributionSourceDistributionNonSource</p><p><strong>Trigger modification:</strong>AlteredUnmodified</p></li><li><h5>Independance from external data and code</h5><pre>[LGPL] 2.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-only</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul></ul></p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong></p><p><strong>Trigger explanation:</strong>DistributionSourceDistributionNonSource</p><p><strong>Trigger modification:</strong>AlteredUnmodified</p></li><li><h5>Dont implement Anti-Circumvention Law.</h5><pre>[GPL] 3.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-or-later</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul><li><h5>Preserve legal mentions in source code</h5><p><strong>Description:</strong>Keep all legal notices and license texts intact in the Source Code, including in the headers.</p><p><strong>Metacategory:</strong>Mentions</p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p></li></ul></p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p><p><strong>Trigger explanation:</strong>DistributionSourceDistributionNonSource</p><p><strong>Trigger modification:</strong>AlteredUnmodified</p></li><li><h5>Marking modifications</h5><pre>[GPL]5. a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
[...] A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
[GPL]13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

4. d) Do one of the following:

    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
[LGPL] 5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-or-later</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul><li><h5>Weak Copyleft</h5><p><strong>Description:</strong>Some categories of derivative works or of works based on the Open Source Software must be distributed under the initial license or another license approved by the initial license.</p><p><strong>Metacategory:</strong>IP management</p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p></li></ul></p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong>Active</p><p><strong>Trigger explanation:</strong>DistributionSourceDistributionNonSource</p><p><strong>Trigger modification:</strong>AlteredUnmodified</p></li><li><h5>Independance from external data and code</h5><pre>[LGPL] 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</pre><p><strong>License:</strong><ul><li>LGPL-3.0-or-later</li></ul></p><p><strong>Generics:</strong><ul></ul></p><p><strong>Passivity:</strong></p><p><strong>Trigger explanation:</strong>DistributionSourceDistributionNonSource</p><p><strong>Trigger modification:</strong>AlteredUnmodified</p></li><li><h5>Dont implement Anti-Circumvention Law.</h5><pre>[GPL] 3.

This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n[...] A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\r\n[GPL]13.

The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n[LGPL] \r\n4. d) Do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\r\n    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\r\n\r\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n[LGPL] 5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\r\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&quot;

Additional Definitions.\n \n  As used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n \n  \&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n \n  An \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n \n  A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked\nVersion\&quot;.\n \n  The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n \n  The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n \n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n \n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n \n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n \n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n \n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n \n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n \n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n \n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n \n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n \n  4. Combined Works.\n \n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n \n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n \n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n \n   d) Do one of the following:\n \n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n \n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n \n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n \n  5. Combined Libraries.\n \n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n \n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n \n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n \n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n \n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n \n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot;\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.&quot;

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \&quot;this License\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \&quot;GNU GPL\&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \&quot;The Library\&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \&quot;Application\&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \&quot;Combined Work\&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \&quot;Linked\nVersion\&quot;.\n\n  The \&quot;Minimal Corresponding Source\&quot; for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \&quot;Corresponding Application Code\&quot; for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot;\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.&quot;

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

(If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6.

Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \&quot;or any later version\&quot;\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n&quot;,
