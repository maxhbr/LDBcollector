          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import&#39;&#39;) the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import&#39;&#39;) the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

          [1] A Developer specific license.

          [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

          (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

 his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.

            Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
               governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
               Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
               License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
               include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
               not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
               applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You
               may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
               3.5.

               must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in
               Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
               version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
               Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
               must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
               available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
               Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial
               Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means
               provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as
               maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the
               Modification to be made available.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to
               contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date

               directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
               the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
               Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
               of the Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;

              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
                 right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                 must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;
                 which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
                 recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
                 Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the
                 LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
                 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are
                 Contributor&amp;apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                 grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
               and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and
               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
               recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make
               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute
               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
               Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
             terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or
             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of this License.
          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,
             and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

            New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
               to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted
               to opensource.org for certification.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
               the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
               also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
               License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right
               to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in
               association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which
               you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by
               this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
               ``OpenPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ``OPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
               anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
               contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the
               Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
               not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

          TERMINATION.
        
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.1&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination upon Breach
              &lt;br /&gt;

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail
                   to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
                   becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are
                   properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that,
                   by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
                   shall survive.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
               claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
               (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
               &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
              such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
                 then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                 prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
                 in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
                 and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
                 litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
                 within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                 withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
                 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
                 above.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
              any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor
                 Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
                 by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
                 date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                 Participant.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
               Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
               such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
               patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
               Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
               amount or value of any payment or license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.4.&lt;/var&gt;
            In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
               (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
               distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
          &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
             OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
             COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR
             ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
             WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
             MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
             BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
             TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
             EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
             OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
             APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

          U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
          &lt;p&gt;The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
             (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and ``commercial
             computer software documentation,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

             1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth
             herein.&lt;/p&gt;

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this 
License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; 
rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may 
add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not 
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a 
user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge 
a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients 
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of 
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice 
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the 
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice 
in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you 
distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the 
notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the 
product.

3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect 
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) 
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite 
all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this 
license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.
6.1. New Versions.
License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be 
submitted to opensource.org for certification.
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.
If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the 
required Devloper Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do 
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this 
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;OpenPL&quot;, 
&quot;OPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ 
from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be 
deemed to be modifications of this License.)

6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in 
the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

[1] A Developer specific license.

[2] The contents of this file OPL.html, stating the general licensing policy of 
the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-
numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE 
OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY 
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER. 

8. TERMINATION. 
8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail 
to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly 
granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, 
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
8.2. Termination Upon Litigation.
If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or 
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action 
is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from 
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by 
such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the 
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon 
in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights 
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically 
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights 
granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are 
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or 
had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 
Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license 
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by 
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF 
COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION 
OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial 
computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with 
only those rights set forth herein.

are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of 
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made 
available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer 
responsibility on an equitable basis.

Version 1.0, July 14. 1998

This document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying

Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license.

1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.

3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.

NO WARRANTY
4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>OPEN PUBLIC LICENSE

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

Version 1.0, July 14, 1998. 

This document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use. 

The original version of this document may be found at http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml 

LICENSE 

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying 

Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license. 

1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change. 

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law. 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable. 

3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC. 

NO WARRANTY 

4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre></details></li></ul><h1>by Source</h1><ul><li><h3><a href="/source/SPDX">SPDX</a>: <a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad">SPDXLicense:a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad</a> for <a href="/?license=spdx:OPL-1.0"><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>OPL-1.0</span></a></h3><div class="two-columns-grid"><div><h2>LicenseNames</h2><ul><li><b>this:</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>OPL-1.0</span></li></ul></li><li><b>other LicenseNames (1):</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename">Open Public License v1.0</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2>License Ratings</h2><ul><li><span title="">FSF: <b style="color: red;">Not-Libre</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li><li><span title="">OSI: <b style="color: red;">Rejected</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/a8d5d965dec3612afbc69d6b352700ad">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li></ul><h3>URLs</h3><ul><li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/Open_Public_License" target="_blank">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/Open_Public_License</a></li><li><a href="http://old.koalateam.com/jackaroo/OPL_1_0.TXT" target="_blank">http://old.koalateam.com/jackaroo/OPL_1_0.TXT</a></li></ul></div></div><h3>Texts</h3><ul><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>OPEN PUBLIC LICENSE

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

          [1] A Developer specific license.

          [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

          (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.1.&lt;/var&gt;
            Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
               governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
               Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
               License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
               include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
               not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
               applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You
               may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
               3.5.

               must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in
               Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
               version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
               Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
               must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
               available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
               Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial
               Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means
               provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as
               maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the
               Modification to be made available.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to
               contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date

               directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
               the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
               Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
               of the Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
                 right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                 must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;
                 which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
                 recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
                 Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the
                 LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
                 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are
                 Contributor&amp;apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                 grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
               and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and
               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
               recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make
               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute
               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.
          &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;
            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
               Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
             terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or
             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,
             and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

            Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
               the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
               also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
               License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right

               association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which
               you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by
               this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
               ``OpenPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ``OPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
               anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
               contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the

            Termination upon Breach
              &lt;br /&gt;

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail
                   to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
                   becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are
                   properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that,
                   by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
                   shall survive.

          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
               claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
               (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
               &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;

              such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
                 then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                 prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
                 in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
                 and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
                 litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
                 within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                 withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
                 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
                 above.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor
                 Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
                 by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
                 date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                 Participant.
            &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
               Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
               such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
               patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
               Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
               amount or value of any payment or license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

            In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
               (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
               distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
          &lt;/li&gt;

             MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
             BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
             TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
             EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
             OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
             APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n          (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\nThis license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n\n          [1] A Developer specific license.\n\n          [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n\nIn case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1 Termination upon Breach\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n     8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n          (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11.

The\n               Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this\n               License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\n               include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may\n               not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\n               applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You\n               may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section\n               3.5.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Availability of Source Code.

You shall notify the Initial\n               Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means\n               provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as\n               maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the\n               Modification to be made available.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to\n               contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date\n               of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\n               directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including\n               the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n               Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership\n               of the Covered Code.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.4.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Intellectual Property Matters\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property\n                 right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you\n                 must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;\n                 which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a\n                 recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your\n                 Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the\n                 LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps\n                 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to\n                 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                     \n&lt;li&gt;\n                        &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;\n              Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\n                 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are\n                 Contributor&amp;apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to\n                 grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n                  \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n               &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,\n               and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe\n               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more\n               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit\n               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory\n               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and\n               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that\n               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only\n               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You\n               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\n               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have\n               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any\n               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\n               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and\n               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n               recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make\n               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute\n               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in\n               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not\n               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.\n               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n               Covered Code.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some\n             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the\n             terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or\n             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the\n             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Application of this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,\n             and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Versions of the License.\n        \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;\n            New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time\n               to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted\n               to opensource.org for certification.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.2.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n               the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may\n               also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n               License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right\n               to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in\n               association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which\n               you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by\n               this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,\n               ``OpenPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ``OPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\n               anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license\n               contains terms which differ from the Open Public License.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change.

If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\nThis license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n\n          [1] A Developer specific license.\n\n          [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n\nIn case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7.

Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n     8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n          (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10.

If You created one or more\n               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit\n               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory\n               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and\n               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that\n               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only\n               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You\n               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\n               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have\n               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any\n               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\n               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and\n               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n               recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make\n               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute\n               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in\n               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not\n               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.\n               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n               Covered Code.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some\n             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the\n             terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or\n             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the\n             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Application of this License.\n          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,\n             and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n          Versions of the License.\n        \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;\n            New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n               the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may\n               also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n               License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right\n               to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;\n            Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in\n               association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which\n               you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by\n               this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,\n               ``OpenPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ``OPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\n               anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license\n               contains terms which differ from the Open Public License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Application of this License.\n\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Required Additional Developer Specific License\n\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;[1]\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; A Developer specific license.\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;[2]\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, 
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original 
Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger 
Work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, 
to make, have made, use and sell (&quot;offer to sell and import&quot;) the Original 
Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is 
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions 
thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further 
Modifications or combinations.

2.2. Contributor Grant.
Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, 
subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, 
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an 
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a 
Larger Work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to 
make, have made, use and sell (&quot;offer to sell and import&quot;) the Contributor 
Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is 
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or 
portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to 
Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the 
terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code 
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a 
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not 
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You 
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in 
Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source 
Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an 
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone 
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) 
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a 
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such 
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of 
the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific 
license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may 
provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made 
available.

3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of 
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, 
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and 
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any 
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the 
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in 
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must 
include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which 
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You 
make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall 
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter 
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) 
above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s 
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this 
License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; 
rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may 
add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not 
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a 
user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge 
a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients 
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of 
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice 
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the 
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice 
in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you 
distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the 
notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the 
product.

3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect 
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) 
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite 
all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this 
license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.
6.1. New Versions.
License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be 
submitted to opensource.org for certification.
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.
If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the 
required Devloper Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do 
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this 
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;OpenPL&quot;, 
&quot;OPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ 
from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be 
deemed to be modifications of this License.)

6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in 
the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

[1] A Developer specific license.

[2] The contents of this file OPL.html, stating the general licensing policy of 
the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-
numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE 
OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY 
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER. 

8. TERMINATION. 
8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail 
to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly 
granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, 
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
8.2. Termination Upon Litigation.
If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or 
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action 
is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from 
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by 
such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the 
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon 
in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights 
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically 
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights 
granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are 
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or 
had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 
Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license 
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by 
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF 
COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION 
OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial 
computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with 
only those rights set forth herein. 
11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the 
corresponding addendum described above.
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You 
are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of 
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made 
available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer 
responsibility on an equitable basis.

Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this \nLicense in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; \nrights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may \nadd your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not \npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then \nyou must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a \nuser would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge \na fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients \nof Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on \nbehalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear \nthat any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You \nalone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor \nfor any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of \nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of \nSection 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice \nstating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the \nterms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice \nin an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe \nrecipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable \nversion of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms \ndifferent from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this \nLicense and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or \nalter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must \nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by \nYou alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to \nindemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you \ndistribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the \nnotice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the \nproduct.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not \ngoverned by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single \nproduct. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are \nfulfilled for the Covered Code. \n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect \nto some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) \ncomply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite \nall of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this \nlicense. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must \nbe included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all \ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or \nregulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary \nskill to be able to understand it. \n\n5. Application of this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in \nExhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n6.1. New Versions.\nLicense Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to \ntime. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be \nsubmitted to opensource.org for certification.\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, \nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also \nchoose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the \nLicense published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the \nright to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the \nrequired Devloper Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do \nin order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this \nLicense), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \&quot;Open\&quot;, \&quot;OpenPL\&quot;, \n\&quot;OPL\&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and \n(b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ \nfrom the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original \nCode or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be \ndeemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\nThis license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in \nthe same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n\n[1] A Developer specific license.\n\n[2] The contents of this file OPL.html, stating the general licensing policy of \nthe software.\n\nIn case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-\nnumbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, \nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, \nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE \nIS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \nOR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \nPERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY \nCOVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE \nINITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF \nANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER \nOF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO \nUSE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER \nTHIS DISCLAIMER. \n\n8. TERMINATION. \n8.1 Termination upon Breach\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail \nto comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming \naware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly \ngranted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, \nmust remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n8.2. Termination Upon Litigation.\nIf You initiate litigation by asserting a patent \ninfringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or \na Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action \nis referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any \npatent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under \nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from \nParticipant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of \nnotice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable \nreasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by \nsuch Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the \nContributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a \nreasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon \nin writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights \ngranted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically \nterminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s \nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights \ngranted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are \nrevoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or \nhad made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such \nParticipant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such \nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the \namount or value of any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \nYou or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER \nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE \nINITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF \nCOVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE \nTO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, \nOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT \nLIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, \nCOMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER \nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE \nBEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION \nOF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL \nINJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT \nAPPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO \nNOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR \nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY \nNOT APPLY TO YOU. \n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \nThe Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 \n(Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot; and \&quot;commercial \ncomputer software documentation,\&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 \n(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through \n227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with \nonly those rights set forth herein. \n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \nThis section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the \ncorresponding addendum described above.\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You \nare responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of \nrights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made \navailable, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant \nfactors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer \nresponsibility on an equitable basis. \nExhibit A. \nText for this Exhibit A is found in the corresponding addendum, described in section \n6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial Developer.

Version 1.0, July 14. 1998

This document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use.

The original version of this document may be found at http://www.opencontent.org/opl.html

LICENSE

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying

Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license.

1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.

3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.

NO WARRANTY
4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.\n\n3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC \&quot;AS IS\&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&quot;,

         (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import&#39;&#39;) the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

      2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

   3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   5. Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   6. Versions of the License.

      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&#39;&#39;, ``OpenPL&#39;&#39;, ``OPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License

      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

         [1] A Developer specific license.

         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.

      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   8. TERMINATION.

      8.1 Termination upon Breach

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

         (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   11. MISCELLANEOUS.

   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.

   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis. EXHIBIT A.

SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   8. TERMINATION.\n\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n         (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors.

Version 1.0, July 14, 1998. 

This document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use.

LICENSE 

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying 

Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license. 

1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change. 

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law. 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable. 

3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC. 

NO WARRANTY 

4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{
