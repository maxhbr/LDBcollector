This is the official license for the Python 2.0.1 release:

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
language called ABC.  Guido is Python&#39;s principal author, although it
includes many contributions from others.  The last version released
from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python
at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python
1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and
the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the
BeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release
from BeOpen.com.

Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left
CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that
the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public
License (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software
Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the
Python license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,
with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables
later versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work
of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.

After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the
other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All
intellectual property added from this point on, including Python
2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software
Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software
Foundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about
the PSF.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#39;s
direction to make these releases possible.

This is the official license for the Python 2.0.1 release:

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
language called ABC.  Guido is Python&#39;s principal author, although it
includes many contributions from others.  The last version released
from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python
at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python
1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and
the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the
BeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release
from BeOpen.com.

Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left
CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that
the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public
License (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software
Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the
Python license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,
with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables
later versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work
of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.

After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the
other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All
intellectual property added from this point on, including Python
2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software
Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software
Foundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about
the PSF.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#39;s
direction to make these releases possible.

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;Python 2.0.1 license\n\nThis is the official license for the Python 2.0.1 release:\n\nA. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python&#39;s principal author, although it\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\nfrom BeOpen.com.\n\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\n\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the\nother PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All\nintellectual property added from this point on, including Python\n2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software\nFoundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about\nthe PSF.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#39;s\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.
