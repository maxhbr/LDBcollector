Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).

Definitions:

     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:

     rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:

     accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).

Definitions:

    * &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.
    * &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
    * &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
    * &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
    * &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 


*

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:

    rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:

However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE
 
 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 
 
DEFINITIONS
 
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:
 
in the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. (&quot;The Open Group&quot;), the Original Program, and
 
in the case of each Contributor,
                                                              i.       changes to the Program, and
                                                           ii.      additions to the Program;
 
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
 
                                      i.      are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program, and
                                   ii.      are not derivative works of the Program.
 
&quot;Contributor&quot; means The Open Group and any other entity that distributes the Program.
 
&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
 
&quot;Open Source&quot; programs mean software for which the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges.
&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.
 
&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.
 
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
 
 
GRANT OF RIGHTS
 
The rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with, or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs.
 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 
 Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
 
a.      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 
b.     its license agreement:
                                                        i.      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
                                                     ii.      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
                                                   iii.      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                                                   iv.      states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 
When the Program is made available in source code form:
 
a.      it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 
b.     a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:
 
Copyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved.
 
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 
 
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
 
a.      promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 
b.     allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.
 
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 
 
NO WARRANTY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 
 
DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
 
GENERAL
 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such non-compliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 
The Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 
No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.\n\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.\n\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).\n\nDefinitions:\n\n     \&quot;Package\&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n     \&quot;Standard Version\&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n     \&quot;Copyright Holder\&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n     \&quot;You\&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n     \&quot;Reasonable copying fee\&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n     \&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:\n\n     rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:\n\n     accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n\n7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\n\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n9.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).

Definitions:

    * &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.
    * &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
    * &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
    * &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
    * &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 


*

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:

    rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:

    accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE
 
 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 
 
DEFINITIONS
 
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:
 
in the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. (&quot;The Open Group&quot;), the Original Program, and
 
in the case of each Contributor,
                                                              i.       changes to the Program, and
                                                           ii.      additions to the Program;
 
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
 
                                      i.      are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program, and
                                   ii.      are not derivative works of the Program.
 
&quot;Contributor&quot; means The Open Group and any other entity that distributes the Program.
 
&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
 
&quot;Open Source&quot; programs mean software for which the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges.
&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.
 
&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.
 
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
 
 
GRANT OF RIGHTS
 
The rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with, or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs.
 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 
 Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
 
a.      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 
b.     its license agreement:
                                                        i.      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
                                                     ii.      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
                                                   iii.      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                                                   iv.      states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 
When the Program is made available in source code form:
 
a.      it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 
b.     a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:
 
Copyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved.
 
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 
 
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
 
a.      promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 
b.     allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.
 
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 
 
NO WARRANTY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 
 
DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
 
GENERAL
 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such non-compliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 
The Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 
No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n \n \nDEFINITIONS\n \n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n \nin the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. (\&quot;The Open Group\&quot;), the Original Program, and\n \nin the case of each Contributor,\n                                                              i.       changes to the Program, and\n                                                           ii.      additions to the Program;\n \nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n \n                                      i.      are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program, and\n                                   ii.      are not derivative works of the Program.\n \n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means The Open Group and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n \n\&quot;Licensed Patents\&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n \n\&quot;Open Source\&quot; programs mean software for which the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges.\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n \n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.\n \n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n \n \nGRANT OF RIGHTS\n \nThe rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with, or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs.\n \nSubject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n \n Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n \nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n \nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n \n \nREQUIREMENTS\n \nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n \na.      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n \nb.     its license agreement:\n                                                        i.      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n                                                     ii.      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n                                                   iii.      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n                                                   iv.      states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n \nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n \na.      it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n \nb.     a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n \nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n \nCopyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved.\n \nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n \nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n \na.      promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n \nb.     allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.\n \nThe Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n \nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n \n \nNO WARRANTY\n \nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n \n \nDISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n \nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n \nGENERAL\n \nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n \nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n \nAll Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such non-compliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n \nThe Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n \nNo party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n &quot;,

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:

   rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:

   accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

                &quot;Lizenzen ohne Copyleft-Effekt zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie dem Lizenznehmer alle Freiheiten einer Open Source Lizenz einräumen und für Veränderungen der Software keine Bedingungen hinsichtlich des zu verwendenden Lizenztyps enthalten. Damit kann der Lizenznehmer veränderte Versionen der Software unter beliebigen Lizenzbedingungen weiterverbreiten, also auch in proprietäre Software überführen.&quot;
