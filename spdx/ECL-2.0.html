3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
             separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative

             systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and

          Grant of Copyright License.
          &lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
             reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Patent License.
          &lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
             this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
             otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
             combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
             submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
             counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
             Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
             to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
             filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual
             employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual
             that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where
             the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
             research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
             with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
             following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
               copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
               Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
               notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
               any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
               text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
               by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
               contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
               License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
               distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
               such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
            &lt;p&gt;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
               different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
               modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
               in this License.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Submission of Contributions.
          &lt;p&gt;Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
             the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
             without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
             supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
             Licensor regarding such Contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Trademarks.
          &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
             product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
             describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty.
          &lt;p&gt;Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
             CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
             warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
             redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
             under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.
          &lt;p&gt;In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
             otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
             or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not
             limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
             any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
             the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
         acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
         with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
         Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
         such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;/p&gt;

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

             attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based
             on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,

             For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
             separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
             Works thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

             Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
             intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
             individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
             purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or
             written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
             to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
             systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
             improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
             designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom
             a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
             Work.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

          Grant of Copyright License.
          &lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
             reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
             distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Patent License.
          &lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
             this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
             otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
             combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
             submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
             counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
             Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
             to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
             filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual
             employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual
             that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where
             the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
             research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;

          Redistribution.
          &lt;p&gt;You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
             with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
             following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
               copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
               Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
               notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
               any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
               text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
               by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
               contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
               License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
               distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
               such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
            &lt;p&gt;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
               different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
               modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
               in this License.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Submission of Contributions.
          &lt;p&gt;Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
             the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
             without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
             supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
             Licensor regarding such Contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;

          Trademarks.
          &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
             product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
             describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

          Disclaimer of Warranty.
          &lt;p&gt;Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
             CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
             warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
             redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
             under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability.
          &lt;p&gt;In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
             otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
             or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not
             limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
             any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
             the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
         acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
         with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
         Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
         such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
files.

&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
&quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-
exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-
charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work
to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to
contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is
limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is
also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or
institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your

For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

      

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

      

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

      

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

   3. Grant of Patent License.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.

   4. Redistribution.

   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

      c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions.

   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks.

   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability.

   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.\n\n   4. Redistribution.\n\n   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\n      a.

If the Work includes a \&quot;NOTICE\&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\n\n   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks.\n\n   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability.\n\n   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\nWhile redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
