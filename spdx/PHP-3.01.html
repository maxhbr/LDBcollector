Therefore, a general recommendation on the compatibility of the MS-PL license can only be given for selected cases. Interpretation: It is unclear whether &amp;quot;any portion of the software&amp;quot; assumes code changes and additions that also must be distributed &amp;quot;only under this license&amp;quot;. In addition, a &amp;quot;license that complies with this license&amp;quot; may or may not be interpreted as a copyleft clause. If not, the copyleft condition would depend on the mode of delivery which would require a case-by-case assessment.
