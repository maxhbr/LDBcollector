LPPL Version 1.1 1999-07-10

Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project

Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE
========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:

     1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.

     2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.

     3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.

     4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.

     5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.

     6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.

     7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.

     8. You must do either (A) or (B):

          (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;

          (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.

Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
--------------------------------------------------------

An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.

Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files
---------------------------------------------

If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:

     - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.

     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:
          (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;
          (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).

     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.

Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.

NO WARRANTY
===========

There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
=========================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License
----------------------------------------

If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.

How to Use This License
-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

     %% pig.dtx
     %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name
     %
     % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
     % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
     % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
     % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
     % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 1999/06/01 or later.
     %
     % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.

Important Recommendations
-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes The Program

The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like

      % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.

Noting Exceptional Files

If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.

Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified
               version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on
               Individual Files of The Program&amp;apos;.

            If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions
               on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the
               subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&amp;apos;.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;

            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
            In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (A)&lt;/var&gt;
              distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program)
                 together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by
                 offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering
                 equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even
                 though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified
                 file;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (B)&lt;/var&gt;
              provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to
                 obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator
                 (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of
                 charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later
                 version).
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that in the above, `distribution&amp;apos; of a file means making the file available to
         others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine
         in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself.
         `Modification&amp;apos; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file
         under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a
         significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
         into another language.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have
         been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition
         7. does apply to any such modified file.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the
         updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version
         of that file of The Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
        &lt;br /&gt;

-----------------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without
         also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you
         might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will
         happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not
         occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus
         distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your
         best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many
         programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its
         licensed files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
        &lt;br /&gt;

--------------------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or
         supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions
         exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of
         the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only
         with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed,
         and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files
        &lt;br /&gt;

---------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX
         software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or
         supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename
         extension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&amp;apos; since these are installation
               files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&amp;apos; (LaTeX font
               definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may
               also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names
               provided that:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (1)&lt;/var&gt;
              the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent
                 attempts to access unavailable fonts;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;
              you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to
                 control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&amp;apos;
               (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will)
               specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the
         distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code
         for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY
        &lt;br /&gt;

===========
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder
         provides The Program `as is&amp;apos;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
         including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
         purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The
         Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of
         The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be
         liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
         out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to,
         loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure
         of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or
         said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
        &lt;br /&gt;

=========================================================
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
         considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&amp;apos;
         in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Choosing This License or Another License
        &lt;br /&gt;

----------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those
         in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute
         your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
         license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your
         program is distributed under the LPPL.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The document `modguide.tex&amp;apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the
         conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General
         Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the
         discussion in `modguide.tex&amp;apos; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
         programs under any license are encouraged to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;How to Use This License
        &lt;br /&gt;

-----------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice
         including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the
         file is constrained by the conditions in this license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of such a notice and statement:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; pig.dtx&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; Copyright &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2001 M. Y. Name&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; of this license or (at your option) any later version.
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; The latest version of this license is in
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; version 1999/06/01 or later.
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; This program consists of the &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; files pig.dtx and pig.ins&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply,
         with `The Program&amp;apos; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&amp;apos; and `pig.ins&amp;apos;, and `The
         Copyright Holder&amp;apos; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Important Recommendations
        &lt;br /&gt;

-------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Defining What Constitutes The Program&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore
         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.
         This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the
         copyright notice of each file or by using a line like&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine
         what is considered by you to comprise The Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Noting Exceptional Files&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of
         modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software
         Files&amp;apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the
         exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of
         exceptional files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more
         restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension
         `.cfg&amp;apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a
         modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of
         declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

LPPL Version 1.1  1999-07-10

Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the
base LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish
to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your
program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it
even if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW
TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions,
examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering
distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program
distributed under this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed
and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be
distributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary
and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the
distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The
Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the
distribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing
to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore
needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
The Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while 
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39;
in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================
You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.
Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal
notice forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the
following eight conditions are met:

  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the
     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below
     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of
     The Program&#39;.
 
  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any
     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified
     version of the file that are described below in the subsection
     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.
 
  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the
     original file.
 
  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and
     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program
     which contains it.
 
  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate
     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.
 
  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the
     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to
     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original
     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified
     files.
 
  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids
     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived
     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.
 
  8. You must do either (A) or (B):

       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,
           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified
           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by
           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated
           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program
           from the same place meets this condition, even though third
           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the
           modified file;

       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information
           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;
           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of 
           The Program free of charge (either the version from which
           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the
file available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,
installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is
accessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification&#39; of a file
means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any
applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or
a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of
the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be
applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the
above conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to
any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes
identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.

 
A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------
It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own
personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for
distributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such
modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by
accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may
not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file
that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of
this license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy
of The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide
ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its
licensed files.


Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
--------------------------------------------------------
An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that
supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only
if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the
file or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions
on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with
respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that
is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions
of those files.


Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files
---------------------------------------------
If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,
if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional
conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions
above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:

  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since
    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are
    placed in the files they generate.
 
  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename
    extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard
    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute
    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names
    provided that:
    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of
        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;
    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input
        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition
        files is actually used by TeX).

  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename
    extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names.
    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands
    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.
 
Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,
The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of
components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,
but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.


NO WARRANTY
===========
There is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in
writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or
any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may
distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to
you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of
inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of
data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as
a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
=========================================================
This section contains important instructions, examples, and
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
programs under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in
this section.


Choosing This License or Another License
----------------------------------------
If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to
this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your
program under a different license.  You may use the text of this license
as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to
the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is
distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any
license are encouraged to read it.


How to Use This License
-----------------------
To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also
a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

Important Recommendations
-------------------------
Defining What Constitutes The Program

   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the
   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by
   using a line like

    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
   to comprise The Program.

 Noting Exceptional Files
  
   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on
   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those
   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX
   Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a
   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either
   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of
   exceptional files.

   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are
   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on
   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension
   `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions
   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The
   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples 
   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional
   conditions.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>The LaTeX Project Public License

LPPL Version 1.1 1999-07-10 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project

Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:

   1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.

   2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.

   3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.

   4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.

   5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.

   6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.

   7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.

   8. You must do either (A) or (B):

      (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;

      (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.

Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program

--------------------------------------------------------

An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.

Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files

---------------------------------------------

If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:

   - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.

   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:

      (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;

      (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).

   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.

Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE

=========================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx

%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name

%

% This program may be distributed and/or modified under the

% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1

% of this license or (at your option) any later version.

% The latest version of this license is in

% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

% and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX

% version 1999/06/01 or later.

%

% This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.

         achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&amp;apos; in the
         base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        &lt;br /&gt;

===========================================
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program
         is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of
         that file.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified
               version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on
               Individual Files of The Program&amp;apos;.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
            If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions
               on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the
               subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&amp;apos;.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
            In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and
               the name (if any) of the program which contains it.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified
               file is not part of The Program.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or
               in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the
               original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the
               modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the
               original file.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must do either (A) or (B):
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (A)&lt;/var&gt;
              distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program)
                 together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by
                 offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering
                 equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even
                 though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified
                 file;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (B)&lt;/var&gt;
              provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to
                 obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator
                 (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of
                 charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later
                 version).
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that in the above, `distribution&amp;apos; of a file means making the file available to
         others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine
         in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself.
         `Modification&amp;apos; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file
         under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a
         significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
         into another language.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have
         been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition
         7. does apply to any such modified file.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the
         updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version
         of that file of The Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
        &lt;br /&gt;

-----------------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without
         also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you
         might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will
         happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not
         occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus
         distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your
         best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many
         programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its
         licensed files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
        &lt;br /&gt;

--------------------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or
         supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions
         exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of
         the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only
         with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed,
         and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files
        &lt;br /&gt;

---------------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX
         software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or
         supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename
         extension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&amp;apos; since these are installation
               files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&amp;apos; (LaTeX font
               definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may
               also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names
               provided that:
          
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (1)&lt;/var&gt;
              the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent
                 attempts to access unavailable fonts;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;
              you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to
                 control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&amp;apos;
               (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will)
               specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the
         distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code
         for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY
        &lt;br /&gt;

===========
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder
         provides The Program `as is&amp;apos;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
         including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
         purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The
         Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of
         The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be
         liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
         out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to,
         loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure
         of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or
         said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
        &lt;br /&gt;

=========================================================
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
         considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&amp;apos;
         in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Choosing This License or Another License
        &lt;br /&gt;

----------------------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those
         in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute
         your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
         license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your
         program is distributed under the LPPL.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The document `modguide.tex&amp;apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the
         conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General
         Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the
         discussion in `modguide.tex&amp;apos; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
         programs under any license are encouraged to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;How to Use This License
        &lt;br /&gt;

-----------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice
         including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the
         file is constrained by the conditions in this license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of such a notice and statement:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; pig.dtx&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; Copyright &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2001 M. Y. Name&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; of this license or (at your option) any later version.
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; The latest version of this license is in
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; version 1999/06/01 or later.
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; %&lt;/var&gt; This program consists of the &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; files pig.dtx and pig.ins&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply,
         with `The Program&amp;apos; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&amp;apos; and `pig.ins&amp;apos;, and `The
         Copyright Holder&amp;apos; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Important Recommendations
        &lt;br /&gt;

-------------------------
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Defining What Constitutes The Program&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore
         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.
         This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the
         copyright notice of each file or by using a line like&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine
         what is considered by you to comprise The Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Noting Exceptional Files&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of
         modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software
         Files&amp;apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the
         exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of
         exceptional files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more
         restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension
         `.cfg&amp;apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a
         modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of
         declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:\n\n     1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.\n\n     2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.\n\n     3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n     4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n\n     5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n\n     6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n\n     7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n     8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n          (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;\n\n          (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n     - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n\n     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:\n          (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n          (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n\n     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n     %% pig.dtx\n     %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n     %\n     % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n     % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1\n     % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n     % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n     % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 1999/06/01 or later.\n     %\n     % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n\n      % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.\n\nNoting Exceptional Files\n\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.\n\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.\n&quot;,

It is therefore\n         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\n         This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the\n         copyright notice of each file or by using a line like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\n         what is considered by you to comprise The Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Noting Exceptional Files&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of\n         modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software\n         Files&amp;apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the\n         exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\n         exceptional files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more\n         restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n         `.cfg&amp;apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a\n         modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of\n         declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &quot;,

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;The LaTeX Project Public License\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nLPPL Version 1.1 1999-07-10\n\nCopyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project\n\nEveryone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed.\n\nPREAMBLE\n========\n\nThe LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed.\n\nYou may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:\n\n     1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.\n\n     2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.\n\n     3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n     4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n\n     5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n\n     6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n\n     7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n     8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n          (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;\n\n          (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n     - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n\n     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:\n          (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n          (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n\n     - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n     %% pig.dtx\n     %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n     %\n     % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n     % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1\n     % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n     % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n     % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 1999/06/01 or later.\n     %\n     % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n\n      % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.\n\nNoting Exceptional Files\n\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.\n\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.\n&quot;,

In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute\n         modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\n         maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to\n         achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&amp;apos; in the\n         base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n===========================================\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program\n         is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of\n         that file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified\n               version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on\n               Individual Files of The Program&amp;apos;.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;\n            If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions\n               on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the\n               subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&amp;apos;.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n            In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and\n               the name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified\n               file is not part of The Program.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or\n               in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the\n               original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the\n               modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the\n               original file.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;\n            You must do either (A) or (B):\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (A)&lt;/var&gt;\n              distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program)\n                 together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\n                 offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering\n                 equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even\n                 though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified\n                 file;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (B)&lt;/var&gt;\n              provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to\n                 obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator\n                 (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of\n                 charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later\n                 version).\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Note that in the above, `distribution&amp;apos; of a file means making the file available to\n         others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine\n         in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself.\n         `Modification&amp;apos; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file\n         under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a\n         significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n         into another language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have\n         been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition\n         7. does apply to any such modified file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the\n         updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version\n         of that file of The Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without\n         also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you\n         might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will\n         happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not\n         occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus\n         distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your\n         best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many\n         programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\n         licensed files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or\n         supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions\n         exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of\n         the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only\n         with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed,\n         and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX\n         software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or\n         supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename\n         extension:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&amp;apos; since these are installation\n               files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&amp;apos; (LaTeX font\n               definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may\n               also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\n               provided that:\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (1)&lt;/var&gt;\n              the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent\n                 attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n               \n&lt;li&gt;\n                  &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;\n              you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to\n                 control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;\n            You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&amp;apos;\n               (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will)\n               specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the\n         distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code\n         for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n===========\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder\n         provides The Program `as is&amp;apos;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,\n         including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular\n         purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The\n         Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of\n         The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be\n         liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising\n         out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to,\n         loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure\n         of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or\n         said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n=========================================================\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\n         considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&amp;apos;\n         in this section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Choosing This License or Another License\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those\n         in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute\n         your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own\n         license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your\n         program is distributed under the LPPL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;The document `modguide.tex&amp;apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the\n         conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General\n         Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the\n         discussion in `modguide.tex&amp;apos; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their\n         programs under any license are encouraged to read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;How to Use This License\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n-----------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice\n         including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the\n         file is constrained by the conditions in this license.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of such a notice and statement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; pig.dtx&lt;/var&gt;\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; %%&lt;/var&gt; Copyright &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 2001 M.

Name&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Important Recommendations\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n\n-------------------------\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Defining What Constitutes The Program&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore\n         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\n         This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the\n         copyright notice of each file or by using a line like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\n         what is considered by you to comprise The Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Noting Exceptional Files&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of\n         modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software\n         Files&amp;apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the\n         exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\n         exceptional files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n      &lt;p&gt;Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more\n         restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n         `.cfg&amp;apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a\n         modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of\n         declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &quot;,

This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(A)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(B)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(1)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(2)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nHow to Use This License\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;%%&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;filename\&quot;;original=\&quot;pig.dtx\&quot;;match=\&quot;.+\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;%%&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; Copyright &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;copyright\&quot;;original=\&quot;2001 M.

Y. Name&#39;.\n\nImportant Recommendations\n\n-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n\n% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.\n\nNoting Exceptional Files\n\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.\n\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.\n\n&quot;

LPPL Version 1.1  1999-07-10

Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the
base LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish
to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your
program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it
even if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW
TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions,
examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering
distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program
distributed under this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed
and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be
distributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary
and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the
distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The
Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the
distribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing
to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore
needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
The Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while 
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39;
in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================
You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.
Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal
notice forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the
following eight conditions are met:

  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the
     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below
     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of
     The Program&#39;.
 
  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any
     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified
     version of the file that are described below in the subsection
     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.
 
  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the
     original file.
 
  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and
     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program
     which contains it.
 
  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate
     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.
 
  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the
     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to
     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original
     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified
     files.
 
  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids
     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived
     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.
 
  8. You must do either (A) or (B):

       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,
           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified
           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by
           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated
           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program
           from the same place meets this condition, even though third
           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the
           modified file;

       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information
           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;
           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of 
           The Program free of charge (either the version from which
           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the
file available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,
installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is
accessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification&#39; of a file
means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any
applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or
a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of
the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be
applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the
above conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to
any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes
identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.

 
A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------
It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own
personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for
distributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such
modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by
accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may
not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file
that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of
this license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy
of The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide
ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its
licensed files.


Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program
--------------------------------------------------------
An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that
supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only
if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the
file or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions
on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with
respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that
is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions
of those files.


Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files
---------------------------------------------
If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,
if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional
conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions
above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:

  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since
    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are
    placed in the files they generate.
 
  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename
    extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard
    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute
    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names
    provided that:
    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of
        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;
    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input
        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition
        files is actually used by TeX).

  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename
    extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names.
    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands
    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.
 
Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,
The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of
components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,
but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.


NO WARRANTY
===========
There is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in
writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or
any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may
distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to
you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of
inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of
data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as
a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE
=========================================================
This section contains important instructions, examples, and
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
programs under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in
this section.


Choosing This License or Another License
----------------------------------------
If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to
this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your
program under a different license.  You may use the text of this license
as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to
the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is
distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any
license are encouraged to read it.


How to Use This License
-----------------------
To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also
a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is
constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

  %% pig.dtx
  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name
  %
  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
  % The latest version of this license is in
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
  % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX 
  % version 1999/06/01 or later.
  %
  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in
this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the
two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring
to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.


Important Recommendations
-------------------------
Defining What Constitutes The Program

   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the
   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by
   using a line like

    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
   to comprise The Program.

 Noting Exceptional Files
  
   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on
   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those
   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX
   Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a
   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either
   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of
   exceptional files.

   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are
   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on
   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension
   `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions
   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The
   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples 
   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional
   conditions.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

This license may be particularly suitable if your\nprogram is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW\nTO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions,\nexamples, and recommendations for authors who are considering\ndistributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program\ndistributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed\nand conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be\ndistributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary\nand/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the\ndistribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The\nProgram may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the\ndistribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing\nto distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore\nneeds to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while \nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39;\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.\nDistribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal\nnotice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the\nfollowing eight conditions are met:\n\n  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\n     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below\n     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of\n     The Program&#39;.\n \n  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any\n     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified\n     version of the file that are described below in the subsection\n     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.\n \n  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the\n     original file.\n \n  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and\n     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program\n     which contains it.\n \n  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate\n     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n \n  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the\n     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to\n     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original\n     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified\n     files.\n \n  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids\n     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived\n     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n \n  8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,\n           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified\n           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\n           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated\n           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program\n           from the same place meets this condition, even though third\n           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the\n           modified file;\n\n       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information\n           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;\n           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of \n           The Program free of charge (either the version from which\n           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the\nfile available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,\ninstalling the file on any machine in such a way that the file is\naccessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification&#39; of a file\nmeans any procedure that produces a derivative file under any\napplicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or\na significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of\nthe file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be\napplied to files that have been modified in accordance with the\nabove conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to\nany such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\napply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes\nidentical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\n \nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for\ndistributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may\nnot occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file\nthat you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of\nthis license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy\nof The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide\nways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\nlicensed files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that\nsupplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only\nif, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the\nfile or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\nof those files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\nconditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since\n    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are\n    placed in the files they generate.\n \n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard\n    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute\n    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\n    provided that:\n    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\n        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\n        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\n        files is actually used by TeX).\n\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names.\n    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands\n    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n \nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\nThere is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\ndistribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nprograms under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in\nthis section.\n\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to\nthis license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your\nprogram under a different license.  You may use the text of this license\nas a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to\nthe LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is\ndistributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\na statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is\nconstrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX \n  % version 1999/06/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\nthis license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the\ntwo files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring\nto the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the\n   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line like\n\n    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise The Program.\n\n Noting Exceptional Files\n  \n   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\n   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\n   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\n   Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\n   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\n   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\n   exceptional files.\n\n   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\n   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\n   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n   `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions\n   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The\n   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples \n   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional\n   conditions.&quot;,

LPPL Version 1.1 1999-07-10 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project

Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed.

You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.

In this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.

This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.

You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.

You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:

   1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.

   2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.

   3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.

   4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.

   5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.

   6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.

   7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.

   8. You must do either (A) or (B):

      (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;

      (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).

Note that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

Changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.

The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.

Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program

--------------------------------------------------------

An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.

Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files

---------------------------------------------

If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:

   - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.

   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:

      (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;

      (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).

   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.

Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE

=========================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.

Choosing This License or Another License

----------------------------------------

If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.

How to Use This License

-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

%% pig.dtx

%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name

%

% This program may be distributed and/or modified under the

% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1

% of this license or (at your option) any later version.

% The latest version of this license is in

% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

% and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX

% version 1999/06/01 or later.

%

% This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.

Important Recommendations

-------------------------

Defining What Constitutes The Program

The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like

% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.

Noting Exceptional Files

If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.

Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n\n% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.\n\nNoting Exceptional Files\n\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.\n\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&quot;,

This license may be particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&#39;, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program&#39; refers to any program distributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:\n\n   1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program&#39;.\n\n   2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;.\n\n   3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n   4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n\n   5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n\n   6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n\n   7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n\n   8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n      (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified file;\n\n      (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of charge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution&#39; of a file means making the file available to others by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself. `Modification&#39; of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to any such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n   - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&#39; since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n\n   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd&#39; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may also distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names provided that:\n\n      (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n\n      (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n\n   - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg&#39; (configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you&#39; in this section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex&#39; in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&#39; may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nHow to Use This License\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n%% pig.dtx\n\n%% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n\n%\n\n% This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n\n% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1\n\n% of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n\n% The latest version of this license is in\n\n% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n\n% and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n\n% version 1999/06/01 or later.\n\n%\n\n% This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `The Program&#39; referring to the two files `pig.dtx&#39; and `pig.ins&#39;, and `The Copyright Holder&#39; referring to the person `M. Y. Name&#39;.\n\nImportant Recommendations\n\n-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n\n% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise The Program.\n\nNoting Exceptional Files\n\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&#39;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files.\n\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension `.cfg&#39;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.&quot;,
