THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:

a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (&quot;IBM&quot;), the Original Program, and

b.  in the case of each Contributor,
	i.  changes to the Program, and
	ii.  additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
&#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

&quot;Contributor&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source
code, object code and documentation, if any.

&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.

&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
se is licensed hereunder.

c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided that:

a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b.  its license agreement:
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          DEFINITIONS
            &lt;br /&gt;

   &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; means:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
                  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (&amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot;), the Original Program, and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
                  in the case of each Contributor,
                
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; i.&lt;/var&gt;
                    changes to the Program, and
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; ii.&lt;/var&gt;
                    additions to the Program;
                      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
                      are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
                      &amp;apos;originates&amp;apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
                      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&amp;apos;s
                      behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                           
&lt;li&gt;
                              &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; (i)&lt;/var&gt;
                          are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
                            &lt;br /&gt;

            the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
                            &lt;br /&gt;

            derivative works of the Program.

                        &lt;/li&gt;
                        
&lt;/ul&gt;
                     &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Licensed Patents &amp;quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
            Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
            Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Original Program&amp;quot; means the original version of the software
            accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source
            code, object code and documentation, if any.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Program&amp;quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Recipient&amp;quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this
            Agreement, including all Contributors.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
                license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
                publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
                object code form.

            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
                license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
                import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
                if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
                shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
                if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
                addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
                the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
                other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
                se is licensed hereunder.

            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
                &lt;br /&gt;

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
                &lt;br /&gt;

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
                &lt;br /&gt;

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
                &lt;br /&gt;

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
                &lt;br /&gt;

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
                &lt;br /&gt;

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Recipient&amp;apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before
                &lt;br /&gt;

      distributing the Program.

            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
              Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
                &lt;br /&gt;

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          REQUIREMENTS
            &lt;br /&gt;

   A Contributor may choose to distribute
            the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
            provided that:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
              it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              its license agreement:
                
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; i.&lt;/var&gt;
                    effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
                      and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
                      conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
                      conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; ii.&lt;/var&gt;
                    effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
                      for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
                      consequential damages, such as lost profits;

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iii.&lt;/var&gt;
                    states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
                      offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iv.&lt;/var&gt;
                    states that source code for the Program is available from such
                      Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
                      manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the Program is made available in source code form: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
              it must be made available under this Agreement; and
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
            of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
            subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
            &lt;br /&gt;

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
            responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
            like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
            use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
            commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
            create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
            Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
            such Contributor (&amp;quot;Commercial Contributor&amp;quot;) hereby agrees to defend
            and indemnify every other Contributor (&amp;quot;Indemnified Contributor&amp;quot;)
            against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot;) arising
            from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
            party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
            acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
            its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
            The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
            In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
            notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
            allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
            Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
            negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
            such claim at its own expense.

          &lt;p&gt;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
            product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
            Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
            claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
            claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&amp;apos;s
            responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
            would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
            those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
            other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
            &lt;br /&gt;

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
            PROVIDED ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
            KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
            WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
            OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
            responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
            distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
            exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
            the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
            laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
            unavailability or interruption of operations.

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
            &lt;br /&gt;

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
            NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
            INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
            ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
            TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
            THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          GENERAL
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
            applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
            the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
            action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
            minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

          &lt;p&gt;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
            respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
            or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by
            that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
            terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if
            Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
            a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
            itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
            hardware) infringes such Recipient&amp;apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&amp;apos;s
            rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
            litigation is filed.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;All Recipient&amp;apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
            fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
            Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
            time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&amp;apos;s
            rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
            and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
            However, Recipient&amp;apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM

PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION

OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   1. DEFINITIONS

   &quot;Contribution&quot; means:

      a. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (&quot;IBM&quot;), the Original Program, and

      b. in the case of each Contributor,

         i. changes to the Program, and

         ii. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:

            (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with

            the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not

            derivative works of the Program.

   &quot;Contributor&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

   &quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

   &quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

   &quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.

   &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is

      Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before

      distributing the Program.

      d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

   3. REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

      a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      b. its license agreement:

         i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

   Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   5. NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</pre></details></li></ul><h1>by Source</h1><ul><li><h3><a href="/source/SPDX">SPDX</a>: <a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">SPDXLicense:eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083</a> for <a href="/?license=spdx:IPL-1.0"><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>IPL-1.0</span></a></h3><div class="two-columns-grid"><div><h2>LicenseNames</h2><ul><li><b>this:</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>IPL-1.0</span></li></ul></li><li><b>other LicenseNames (1):</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename">IBM Public License v1.0</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2>License Ratings</h2><ul><li><span title="">FSF: <b style="color: green;">Libre</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li><li><span title="">OSI: <b style="color: green;">Approved</b></span><span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li></ul><h2>License Comments</h2><ul><li><b>SPDXLicense: </b>This license was superseded by CPL.<span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="SPDXLicense:eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">[<a href="/fact/SPDXLicense/eb53b19b8ce1693e94f7f99bfe065083">SPDXLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li></ul><h3>URLs</h3><ul><li><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/IPL-1.0" target="_blank">https://opensource.org/licenses/IPL-1.0</a></li></ul></div></div><h3>Texts</h3><ul><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>IBM Public License Version 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
&quot;Contribution&quot; means:

a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (&quot;IBM&quot;), the Original Program, and

b.  in the case of each Contributor,
	i.  changes to the Program, and
	ii.  additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
&#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

&quot;Contributor&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source
code, object code and documentation, if any.

&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.

&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
se is licensed hereunder.

c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided that:

a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b.  its license agreement:
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

                      &amp;apos;originates&amp;apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
                      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&amp;apos;s

              Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
                license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
                publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
                license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
                import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
                if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
                shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
                if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
                addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
                the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
                other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
                se is licensed hereunder.

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
              Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
                &lt;br /&gt;

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
                &lt;br /&gt;

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
                &lt;br /&gt;

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
                &lt;br /&gt;

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
                &lt;br /&gt;

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
                &lt;br /&gt;

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Recipient&amp;apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before
                &lt;br /&gt;

      distributing the Program.

            &lt;/li&gt;

              Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
                &lt;br /&gt;

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
                &lt;br /&gt;

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

            &lt;/li&gt;

          REQUIREMENTS
            &lt;br /&gt;

   A Contributor may choose to distribute
            the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
            provided that:

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
              it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              its license agreement:
                
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; i.&lt;/var&gt;
                    effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
                      and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
                      conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
                      conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; ii.&lt;/var&gt;
                    effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
                      for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
                      consequential damages, such as lost profits;

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iii.&lt;/var&gt;
                    states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
                      offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

                  &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; iv.&lt;/var&gt;
                    states that source code for the Program is available from such
                      Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
                      manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the Program is made available in source code form: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
              it must be made available under this Agreement; and
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
              a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
            of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
            subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
            &lt;br /&gt;

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
            responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
            like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
            use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
            commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
            create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
            Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
            such Contributor (&amp;quot;Commercial Contributor&amp;quot;) hereby agrees to defend
            and indemnify every other Contributor (&amp;quot;Indemnified Contributor&amp;quot;)
            against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot;) arising
            from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
            party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
            acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
            its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
            The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
            In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
            notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
            allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
            Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
            negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
            such claim at its own expense.

          &lt;p&gt;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
            product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
            Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
            claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
            claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&amp;apos;s
            responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
            would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
            those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
            other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.
          &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
            &lt;br /&gt;

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
            PROVIDED ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
            KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
            WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
            OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
            responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
            distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
            exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
            the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
            laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
            unavailability or interruption of operations.

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
            &lt;br /&gt;

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
            NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
            INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
            ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
            TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
            THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          GENERAL
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
            applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
            the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
            action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
            minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

          &lt;p&gt;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
            respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
            or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by
            that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
            terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if
            Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
            a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
            itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
            hardware) infringes such Recipient&amp;apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&amp;apos;s
            rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
            litigation is filed.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;All Recipient&amp;apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
            fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
            Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
            time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&amp;apos;s
            rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
            and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
            However, Recipient&amp;apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any
            licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
            and survive.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
            from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
            distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
            may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
            under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
            Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
            Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
            other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
            expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
            no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
            under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
            otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
            this Agreement are reserved.
          &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
            the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
            party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
            Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
            party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
          &lt;/p&gt;

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\nOF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n\na.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\&quot;IBM\&quot;), the Original Program, and\n\nb.  in the case of each Contributor,\n\ti.  changes to the Program, and\n\tii.  additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n&#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\nsuch Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s\nbehalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with\nthe Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\&quot;Licensed Patents \&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a\nContributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its\nContribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software\naccompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source\ncode, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\na.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\nlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\npublicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\nContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\nobject code form.\n\nb.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\nlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\nimport and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\nif any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\nshall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\nif, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by\nthe Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\nother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\nse is licensed hereunder.\n\nc.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\nEach Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\nbrought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\nproperty rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\nsole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\nneeded, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\nrequired to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\nRecipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before\ndistributing the Program.\n\nd.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\nsufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\ncopyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute\nthe Program in object code form under its own license agreement,\nprovided that:\n\na.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nb.  its license agreement:\n\ti.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n\tand conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n\tconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n\tconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\tii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n\tfor damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n\tconsequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\tiii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n\toffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\tiv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such\n\tContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n\tmanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\na.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and\nb.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\n\tCopyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator\nof its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial\nuse of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;)\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with\nits distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\nThe obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\nIn order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\nnotify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\nsuch claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s\nresponsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor\nwould have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to\nthose performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any\nother Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\nContributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\nNOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,\nINDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON\nANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR\nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF\nTHE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim\nor counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by\nthat Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall\nterminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if\nRecipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any\nlicenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nIBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\nfrom time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one\nother than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor\nunder this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\notherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under\nthis Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this\nAgreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each\nparty waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n&quot;,

While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial\n            use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\n            commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\n            create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\n            Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\n            such Contributor (&amp;quot;Commercial Contributor&amp;quot;) hereby agrees to defend\n            and indemnify every other Contributor (&amp;quot;Indemnified Contributor&amp;quot;)\n            against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot;) arising\n            from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\n            party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\n            acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with\n            its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\n            The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n            In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\n            notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\n            allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n            Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n            negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\n            such claim at its own expense.\n\n          &lt;p&gt;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n            product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n            Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n            claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n            claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&amp;apos;s\n            responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor\n            would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to\n            those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any\n            other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n            Contributor must pay those damages.\n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n          NO WARRANTY\n            &lt;br /&gt;\n\n   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\n            PROVIDED ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n            KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\n            WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\n            OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\nOF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n\na.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\&quot;IBM\&quot;), the Original Program, and\n\nb.  in the case of each Contributor,\n\ti.  changes to the Program, and\n\tii.  additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n&#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\nsuch Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s\nbehalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with\nthe Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\&quot;Licensed Patents \&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a\nContributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its\nContribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software\naccompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source\ncode, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\na.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\nlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\npublicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\nContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\nobject code form.\n\nb.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\nlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\nimport and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\nif any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\nshall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\nif, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by\nthe Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\nother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\nse is licensed hereunder.\n\nc.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\nEach Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\nbrought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\nproperty rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\nsole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\nneeded, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\nrequired to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\nRecipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before\ndistributing the Program.\n\nd.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\nsufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\ncopyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute\nthe Program in object code form under its own license agreement,\nprovided that:\n\na.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nb.  its license agreement:\n\ti.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n\tand conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n\tconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n\tconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\tii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n\tfor damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n\tconsequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\tiii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n\toffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\tiv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such\n\tContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n\tmanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\na.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and\nb.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\n\tCopyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator\nof its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial\nuse of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;)\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with\nits distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\nThe obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\nIn order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\nnotify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\nsuch claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s\nresponsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor\nwould have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to\nthose performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any\nother Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\nContributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial\n            use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\n            commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\n            create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\n            Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\n            such Contributor (&amp;quot;Commercial Contributor&amp;quot;) hereby agrees to defend\n            and indemnify every other Contributor (&amp;quot;Indemnified Contributor&amp;quot;)\n            against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot;) arising\n            from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\n            party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\n            acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with\n            its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\n            The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\n            In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\n            notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\n            allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n            Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n            negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\n            such claim at its own expense.\n\n          &lt;p&gt;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n            product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n            Contributor.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;c.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\n      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\n      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\n      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n\n      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n\n      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n\n      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n\n      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\n\n      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n\n      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n\n      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n\n      Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before\n\n      distributing the Program.\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;d.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n\n      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\n\n      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; REQUIREMENTS\n\n   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; its license agreement:\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;i.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;ii.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;iii.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n         &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;iv.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n   When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;a.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;b.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\n   Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\n   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; NO WARRANTY\n\n   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\n   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\n   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\n   &quot;

Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:

            (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with

            the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not

            derivative works of the Program.

   &quot;Contributor&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

   &quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

   &quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

   &quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.

   &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is

      Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before

      distributing the Program.

      d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

   3. REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

      a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      b. its license agreement:

         i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

   Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   5. NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.

REQUIREMENTS\n\n   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n      a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n      b. its license agreement:\n\n         i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n         ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n         iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n         iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n   When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n      a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n      b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\n   Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\n   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n   5. NO WARRANTY\n\n   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7. GENERAL\n\n   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\n   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\n   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.&quot;,

            &quot;_fossLight_LICENSE_TEXT&quot;: &quot;IBM Public License Version 1.0\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\&quot;AGREEMENT\&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\nOF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n\nin the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\&quot;IBM\&quot;), the Original Program, and\nin the case of each Contributor,\nchanges to the Program, and\nadditions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\&quot;Licensed Patents \&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n \nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nits license agreement:\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\nstates that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\nit must be made available under this Agreement; and\na copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\nCopyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\&quot;Commercial Contributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nIBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.&quot;,
