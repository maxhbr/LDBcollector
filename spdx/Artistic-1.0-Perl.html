Freely available means that there is no charge for the software, and there is no charge for redistribution.<span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="HitachiOpenLicense:92cd8e1ac6a6f09a923ac736e76da300">[<a href="/fact/HitachiOpenLicense/92cd8e1ac6a6f09a923ac736e76da300">HitachiOpenLicense</a>]</span><span title="HitachiOpenLicense:e2525d8a7455fa5ffbe93166293e5cec">[<a href="/fact/HitachiOpenLicense/e2525d8a7455fa5ffbe93166293e5cec">HitachiOpenLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li><li><b>HitachiOpenLicense: </b>http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0<span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="HitachiOpenLicense:92cd8e1ac6a6f09a923ac736e76da300">[<a href="/fact/HitachiOpenLicense/92cd8e1ac6a6f09a923ac736e76da300">HitachiOpenLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li><li><b>HitachiOpenLicense: </b>http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0<span class="provided-by">(provided by: <span title="HitachiOpenLicense:e2525d8a7455fa5ffbe93166293e5cec">[<a href="/fact/HitachiOpenLicense/e2525d8a7455fa5ffbe93166293e5cec">HitachiOpenLicense</a>]</span>)</span></li></ul><h3>URLs</h3><ul><li><a href="http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html" target="_blank">http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html</a></li><li><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0" target="_blank">https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0</a></li><li>OSI Page: <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0" target="_blank">https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0</a></li><li><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html" target="_blank">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html</a></li><li><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0.html" target="_blank">https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0.html</a></li><li><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0-Perl.html" target="_blank">https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0-Perl.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense</a></li><li><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Artistic_v1.0" target="_blank">http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Artistic_v1.0</a></li><li>OSI: <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-1.0" target="_blank">http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-1.0</a></li><li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-1.0" target="_blank">http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-1.0</a></li><li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0" target="_blank">http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense</a></li><li><a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_1_0" target="_blank">http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_1_0</a></li></ul><h3>Other Statements</h3><ul><li>obsolete</li><li>[&quot;not-allowed&quot;]</li><li>http://www.perlfoundation.org/</li><li>http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-1.0</li><li>http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html</li></ul></div></div><h3>Texts</h3><ul><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre>The &quot;Artistic License&quot;

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      &lt;p&gt;Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Package&amp;quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Standard Version&amp;quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Copyright Holder&amp;quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot; is you, if you&amp;apos;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reasonable copying fee&amp;quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Freely Available&amp;quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees

          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this

             and associated disclaimers.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
             or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
             Standard Version.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;

                place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such

                   modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
                   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
              &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot; is you, if you&amp;apos;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reasonable copying fee&amp;quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Freely Available&amp;quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.&lt;/p&gt;

                place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
                   as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
                   modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
                   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables,
                   which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
                   executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

          You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables,
                   giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the
                   differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
                   the Standard Version.

             fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
             However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from
the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package.

C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

   8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

Some versions of the artistic license contain the following clause:

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 

With this clause present, it is called the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-Perl-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.

One such example is the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0. 



The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      &lt;p&gt;The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the
         Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
         while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
         customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Package&amp;quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Standard Version&amp;quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Copyright Holder&amp;quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot; is you, if you&amp;apos;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reasonable copying fee&amp;quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Freely Available&amp;quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.&lt;/p&gt;

          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
             Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices
             and associated disclaimers.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
             or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
             Standard Version.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a
             prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided
             that you do at least ONE of the following:

                place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
                   as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
                   modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
                   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
              &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
                give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in
                   manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
                   Version.
              &lt;/li&gt;

          You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any
             fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
             However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
             programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do
             not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package&amp;apos;s
             interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form
             of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so

          The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
             this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to
             whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
             If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
             &amp;quot;undump&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unexec&amp;quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then
             distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor
             shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent
             such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n     \&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called \&quot;undump\&quot; or \&quot;unexec\&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.\n\n8.

(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n     \&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called \&quot;undump\&quot; or \&quot;unexec\&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.\n\n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n\n9.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      &lt;p&gt;The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the

         while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
         customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reasonable copying fee&amp;quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from
the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                Preamble
 
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.
 
Definitions:
 
    &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
    created through textual modification.
 
    &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
    of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 
    &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or
    copyrights for the package.
 
    &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing
    this Package.
 
    &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the
    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
    and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
    as a market that must bear the fee.)
 
    &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item
    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
    under the same conditions they received it.
 
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:
 
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.
 
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.
 
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.
 
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.
 
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.
 
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.
 
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\nPackage via the so-called \&quot;undump\&quot; or \&quot;unexec\&quot; methods of producing a\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n \n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\nlanguages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\nemulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this\nPackage shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\nequivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\nnot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\nregression tests for the language.\n \n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always\npermitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,\nwhen no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible\nto the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be\nconstrued as a distribution of this Package.\n \n9.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

      c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

   8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

   9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The End</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

      c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

   6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

   7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

   8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

   9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

   10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The End</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

            &quot;_fossLight_LICENSE_TEXT&quot;: &quot;The \&quot;Artistic License\&quot;\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n     \&quot;Package\&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n     \&quot;Standard Version\&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n\n     \&quot;Copyright Holder\&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n     \&quot;You\&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n     \&quot;Reasonable copying fee\&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n     \&quot;Freely Available\&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called \&quot;undump\&quot; or \&quot;unexec\&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.\n\n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n\n9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n10.

Some versions of the artistic license contain the following clause:

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 

With this clause present, it is called the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-Perl-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.

One such example is the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0. 



The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  (NOTE: This license has been superseded by the Artistic License, Version 2.0.) 

This version of the Artistic License 1.0 contains a clause introduced for licensing an implementation of the Perl programming language:

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 

Without this clause present, it is called simply the Artistic License 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.

The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

■&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.
■&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
■&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
■&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
■&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
■&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.

8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Reasonable copying fees refer to the cost of the media, the cost of reproduction, and labor. Any cost that can be justified to the computing community, rather than the copyright holder, that bears the copying fee.
