Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

DEFINITIONS

&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to any and all of the following:

     - font files
     - data files
     - source code
     - build scripts
     - documentation

&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to the Font Software name as seen by users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative font software made by adding to, deleting, or substituting â€” in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Standard or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Standard or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the font from others.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed using this license, and may not be distributed under any other license.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.

         &lt;p&gt;SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PREAMBLE&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font
         projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
         an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they
         are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
         redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed.
         The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Font Software&amp;quot; refers to any and all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

         Copyright Holder.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Modified Version&amp;quot; refers to any derivative font software made by adding to, deleting, or
         substituting â€” in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Standard Version, by
         changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Author&amp;quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who
         contributed to the Font Software.&lt;/p&gt;

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font
names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

DEFINITIONS
&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to any and all of the following:
    - font files
    - data files
    - source code
    - build scripts
    - documentation

&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to the Font Software name as seen by
users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software
components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative font software made by
adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole --
any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats
or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Standard or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Standard or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is
granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all 
references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and
other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the
font from others.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed using this license, and may not be distributed
under any other license.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
