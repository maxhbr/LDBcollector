Nevertheless, the LGPL can still be applied to a Lisp program if certain

Accordingly, the license for the open-source Lisp applications consists

A &quot;Library&quot; in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign
modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for processing

source code or built with some other mechanisms). Foreign modules are
object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable. When we
speak of functions we do so in the most general way to include, in
addition, methods and unnamed functions. Lisp &quot;data&quot; is also a general
term that includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp
classes. A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as
does a Library, but this does not mean that the application is
necessarily a &quot;work based on the Library&quot; it contains.

The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before
any modifications are made to the files. If any of the functions or
classes in the Library are redefined in other files, then those
redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the Library. If additional
methods are added to generic functions in the Library, those additional
methods are NOT considered a work based on the Library. If Library
classes are subclassed, these subclasses are NOT considered a work based
on the Library. If the Library is modified to explicitly call other
functions that are neither part of Lisp itself nor an available add-on
module to Lisp, then the functions called by the modified Library ARE
considered a work based on the Library. The goal is to ensure that the
Library will compile and run without getting undefined function errors.

It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it
must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without that
proprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes between
the case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and one being
statically linked at build time. Section 5 of the LGPL states that the
former results in an executable that is a &quot;work that uses the Library.&quot;
Section 5 of the LGPL states that the latter results in one that is a
&quot;derivative of the Library&quot;, which is therefore covered by the LGPL.
Since Lisp only offers one choice, which is to link the Library into an
executable at build time, we declare that, for the purpose applying the
LGPL to the Library, an executable that results from linking a &quot;work
that uses the Library&quot; with the Library is considered a &quot;work that uses
the Library&quot; and is therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.

Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable to the
Library. However, in connection with each distribution of this
executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the LGPL, the source code of Library (or your derivative
thereof) that is incorporated into this executable.</pre></details></li></ul><h1>by Source</h1><ul><li><h3><a href="/source/Fedora">Fedora</a>: <a href="/fact/FedoraEntry/f5d7c65ab584ce5e49e758368fafa7d0">FedoraEntry:f5d7c65ab584ce5e49e758368fafa7d0</a> for <a href="/?license=Fedora:LLGPL"><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">Fedora:</span>LLGPL</span></a></h3><div class="two-columns-grid"><div><h2>LicenseNames</h2><ul><li><b>this:</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">Fedora:</span>LLGPL</span></li></ul></li><li><b>other LicenseNames (1):</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename"><span class="namespace">spdx:</span>LLGPL</span></li></ul></li><li><b>other LicenseName Hints (2):</b><ul class="capsulUl clearfix"><li><span class="licensename">LLGPL</span></li><li><span class="licensename">LLGPL</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2>License Ratings</h2><ul><li><span title="A license is allowed if Fedora determines that the license is a free software / open source license.

Foreign modules are\nobject code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable. When we\nspeak of functions we do so in the most general way to include, in\naddition, methods and unnamed functions. Lisp \&quot;data\&quot; is also a general\nterm that includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp\nclasses. A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as\ndoes a Library, but this does not mean that the application is\nnecessarily a \&quot;work based on the Library\&quot; it contains.\n\nThe Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before\nany modifications are made to the files.

If additional\nmethods are added to generic functions in the Library, those additional\nmethods are NOT considered a work based on the Library. If Library\nclasses are subclassed, these subclasses are NOT considered a work based\non the Library. If the Library is modified to explicitly call other\nfunctions that are neither part of Lisp itself nor an available add-on\nmodule to Lisp, then the functions called by the modified Library ARE\nconsidered a work based on the Library. The goal is to ensure that the\nLibrary will compile and run without getting undefined function errors.\n\nIt is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it\nmust be done in a way such that the Library will still run without that\nproprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes between\nthe case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and one being\nstatically linked at build time.
