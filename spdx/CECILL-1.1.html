Notice

This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting:
 - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
 - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C : CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

Commissariat à l&#39;Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software&#39;s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user&#39;s attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software&#39;s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

             proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and
             redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
             the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
             defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis
             between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The
             Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee&amp;apos;s use of the
             Software&amp;apos;s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights
             over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.

principles guiding its drafting:
   - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law  of
     torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
     to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
   - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution  of  free
     software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :
CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

PREAMBLE
--------


The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the
right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license
within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for
users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent
redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a
limited warranty and  the software&#39;s author, the holder of the economic
rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user&#39;s attention that the risks
associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means 
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
the Software&#39;s suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions
enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.
This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. 

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

Licensee&#39;s attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are
reserved for experienced users.

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the
product&#39;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,
and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or
property.

9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to
grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights
set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).

9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by  the
Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all
warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant
nature.

Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from
any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be
compatible  with   the   Licensee&#39;s   own   equipment   and   its   software
configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&#39;s requirements.

9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the
Software does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right
relating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.
Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or
all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the
use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should
such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall
provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such
technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case
basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as
regards the Licensee&#39;s use of the Software&#39;s  name.  No  warranty  shall  be
provided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the
Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.


Article 10  - TERMINATION
-------------------------


10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty
(30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained
ineffective.

10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall  no  longer  be
authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or  all
licenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement
shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with
the terms and conditions hereof.


Article 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
--------------------------------------


11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS

Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or  failure  to  perform
the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event  of  force  majeure,  an
act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning,  or
interruptions affecting  the  electricity  or  telecommunications  networks,
blocking of the network following a virus attack, the  intervention  of  the
government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,  fire,
explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several  occasions,  to
invoke  one  or  several  of  the  provisions   hereof,   shall   under   no
circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the  interested  Party  of
its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,
and  constitutes  the  entirety  of  the  agreement  between  said   Parties
concerning said purpose. No supplement or  modification  to  the  terms  and
conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is
made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

11.4. In the event that one or several of  the  provisions  hereof  were  to
conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said
act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make
the necessary amendments so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  said  act  or
legislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.
Similarly, the fact that a provision of  the  Agreement  may   be  null  and
void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole
to be null and void.

             at the time when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested

             in particular, without any or all warranty as to its market value, its secured, innovative or
             relevant nature.
          &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that
             it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee&amp;apos;s own
             equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&amp;apos;s

             or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other
             property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all
             proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and
             redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
             the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
             defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis

          EXCUSABLE EVENTS
          &lt;p&gt;Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may
             be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as,
             notably, defective functioning, or interruptions affecting the electricity or
             telecommunications networks, blocking of the network following a virus attack, the
             intervention of the government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
             fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

          The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the
             provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the
             interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 11.3.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral,

             between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and
             conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and
             signed by their duly authorized representatives.

          In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or
             future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence,
             and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or
             legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a
             provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause
             the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.

                ========================================


Notice
------


This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of  discussions
between its authors  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  two  main
principles guiding its drafting:
   - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law  of
     torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
     to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
   - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution  of  free
     software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :
CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

Commissariat à l&#39;Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical  and
industrial establishment, having its principal place of  business  at  31-33
rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique -  CNRS,  a  public  scientific
and technological establishment, having its principal place of  business  at
3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA,  a
public scientific and  technological  establishment,  having  its  principal
place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt,  BP  105,  78153  Le

PREAMBLE
--------


The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the
right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license
within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for
users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent
redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a
limited warranty and  the software&#39;s author, the holder of the economic
rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user&#39;s attention that the risks
associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means 
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
the Software&#39;s suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions
enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.
This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. 

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

Article 9  - WARRANTY
---------------------


9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards
scientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was
distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor
for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the
Licensee&#39;s attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are
reserved for experienced users.

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the
product&#39;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,
and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or
property.

9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to
grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights
set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).

9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by  the
Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all
warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant
nature.

Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from
any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be
compatible  with   the   Licensee&#39;s   own   equipment   and   its   software
configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&#39;s requirements.

9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the
Software does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right
relating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.
Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or
all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the
use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should
such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall
provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such
technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case
basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as
regards the Licensee&#39;s use of the Software&#39;s  name.  No  warranty  shall  be
provided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the
Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.


Article 10  - TERMINATION
-------------------------


10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty
(30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained
ineffective.

10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall  no  longer  be
authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or  all
licenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement
shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with
the terms and conditions hereof.


Article 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
--------------------------------------


11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS

Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or  failure  to  perform
the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event  of  force  majeure,  an
act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning,  or
interruptions affecting  the  electricity  or  telecommunications  networks,
blocking of the network following a virus attack, the  intervention  of  the
government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,  fire,
explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several  occasions,  to
invoke  one  or  several  of  the  provisions   hereof,   shall   under   no
circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the  interested  Party  of
its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,
and  constitutes  the  entirety  of  the  agreement  between  said   Parties
concerning said purpose. No supplement or  modification  to  the  terms  and
conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is
made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

11.4. In the event that one or several of  the  provisions  hereof  were  to
conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said
act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make
the necessary amendments so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  said  act  or
legislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.
Similarly, the fact that a provision of  the  Agreement  may   be  null  and
void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole
to be null and void.

11.5. LANGUAGE

The Agreement is drafted in both French and  English.  In  the  event  of  a
conflict as  regards  construction,  the  French  version  shall  be  deemed
authentic.

12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies  of
this Agreement.

12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is  protected

each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues
encountered by Free Software.

12.3. Any  or  all  Software  distributed  under  a  given  version  of  the
Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under  the  same  version  of
the Agreement, or  a  subsequent  version,  subject  to  the  provisions  of

endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise  during  the
performance of the Agreement out-of-court.

from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are  necessary,  the
disagreements or disputes shall be  referred  to  the  Paris  Courts  having
jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.

   PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.

   The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

   As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software&#39;s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

   In this respect, it is brought to the user&#39;s attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software&#39;s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

   This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

The Licensee acknowledges that the current situation as regards scientific and technical know-how at the time when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee&#39;s attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software that are reserved for experienced users.\n\n      The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the product&#39;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper functioning, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or property.\n\n      9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights on the Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).\n\n      9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \&quot;as is\&quot; by the Licensor without any or all other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any or all warranty as to its market value, its secured, innovative or relevant nature.\n\n      Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee&#39;s own equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&#39;s requirements.\n\n      9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee&#39;s use of the Software&#39;s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.\n\n   Article 10 - TERMINATION\n\n      10.1. In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.\n\n      10.2. The Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any or all licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.\n\n   Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n      11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS\n\n      Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning, or interruptions affecting the electricity or telecommunications networks, blocking of the network following a virus attack, the intervention of the government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.\n\n      11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.\n\n      11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.\n\n      11.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.\n\n      11.5. LANGUAGE\n\n      The Agreement is drafted in both French and English. In the event of a conflict as regards construction, the French version shall be deemed authentic.\n\n   Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT\n\n      12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement.\n\n      12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, that reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues encountered by Free Software.\n\n      12.3. Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement, or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of article 5.3.4.\n\n   Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\n\n      13.1. The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement out-of-court.\n\n      13.2. In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months as from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.\n\nVersion 1.1 of 10/26/2004&quot;,
