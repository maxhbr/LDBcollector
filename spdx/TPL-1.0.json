The Source Code version of\nCovered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and\nYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\nCode You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\nthis License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create\nor to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form\nunder the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to such recipients.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

The notice\nmust be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\nrights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the\nlicense for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\na different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\nInitial Developer or any Contributor.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect.

No one other than Thomas Richter\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\nunder this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of\nthis License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which\nis not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\nrename Your license so that the phrases \"TPL\", \"THOR Software\",\n\"Thomas Richter\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this\nLicense) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the\nlicense contains terms which differ from the THOR Public\nLicense.

Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If\n                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n                  party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections\n                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the\n                  Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the\n                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\n                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall\n                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\n                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> (b)</var>\n               <p>\n                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include\n                  an application programming interface and Contributor\n                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably\n                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)\n                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as\n                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor\n                  believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s\n                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient\n                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> 3.5.</var>\n               <p>\n                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\n                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible\n                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\n                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\n                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or\n                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source\n                  Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership\n                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,\n                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and\n                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\n                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> 3.6.</var>\n               <p>\n                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\n                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\n                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if\n                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version\n                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n                  License, including a description of how and where You have\n                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must\n                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\n                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You\n                  describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.\n                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or\n                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You\n                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that\n                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n                  limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code\n                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n                  distribute the Executable version under a different license\n                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\n                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by\n                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> 3.7.</var>\n               <p>\n                  Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining\n                  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of\n                  this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\n                  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n                  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> 4.</var>\n               <p>\n                  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n               </p>\n\n               <p>\n                  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the\n                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of the\n                  Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation\n                  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n                  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n                  limitations and the code they affect.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code.

The notice\nmust be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\nrights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the\nlicense for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\na different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\nInitial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify\nthe Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\nby the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\nterms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\nCode with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\nmust make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\nCovered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it.\n\n5.

No one other than Thomas Richter\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\nunder this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of\nthis License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which\nis not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\nrename Your license so that the phrases \"TPL\", \"THOR Software\",\n\"Thomas Richter\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this\nLicense) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the\nlicense contains terms which differ from the THOR Public\nLicense.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE\nIN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.

If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

If\n                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n                  party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections\n                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the\n                  Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the\n                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\n                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall\n                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\n                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n               </p>\n\n            </li>\n            \n<li>\n               <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"> (b)</var>\n               <p>\n                  Contributor APIs.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\n                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible\n                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\n                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\n                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or\n                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source\n                  Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership\n                  rights relating to Covered Code.

The notice must\n                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\n                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You\n                  describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.\n                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or\n                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You\n                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that\n                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n                  limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code\n                  version from the rights set forth in this License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"3.4.\";match=\".{0,20}\">>\n\n   Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(b)\";match=\".{0,20}\">>\n\n   Contributor APIs.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"3.6.\";match=\".{0,20}\">>\n\n   Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
