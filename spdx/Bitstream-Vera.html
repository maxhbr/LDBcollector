You may send a copy of any Bitstream font along with your documents to a commercial printer or other service bureau to enable the editing or printing of your document, provided that such party has informed you that it owns a valid license to use that particular font software. You may also &quot;embed&quot; PC TrueType format fonts within your documents for the viewing, editing, and printing of those documents.

Portable Documents. 
You may send along with your documents a Portable Font Resource (&quot;PFR&quot;) created by Bitstream&#39;s TrueDoc(r), for the purpose of allowing any third party to view, edit, or print the document remotely but with the express understanding that such party may not use such PFR to edit or print any other document unless independently licensed to do so.
