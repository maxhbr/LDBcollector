*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any
Work whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a
similar demonstration of intent:*

SPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0
Licensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0

*or*

Combined Work Exception

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;).

The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &quot;Embargo
Period&quot;) if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.

&quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient&#39;s User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.

### 7.7. License for the Text of this License

The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that
any modifications of this license may not use the name &quot;Cryptographic
Autonomy License&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe
any derived work of this License.

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to 
which it applies (the &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your 
private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software 
from liability.

who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated third party receives any 
part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You 
provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to 
independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss

          &lt;p&gt;
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and 
conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that 
triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.1. &lt;/var&gt;Application
              &lt;p&gt;
The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, 
as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by 
You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a &amp;quot;Modified Work&amp;quot;). 
Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

              &lt;p&gt;
This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You 
show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any 
action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any 
intellectual property right held by Licensor. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 2.3. &lt;/var&gt; Compliance and Remedies
              &lt;p&gt;
Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License 
places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the 
intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, 
the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You 
also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party 
beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You 
via specific performance. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of 
section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
permission to: 
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a) &lt;/var&gt;Take any action with the Work 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;that would infringe the non-patent intellectual 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;subject; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b) &lt;/var&gt; claims that Licensor can license 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or becomes able to license, to the extent that those 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor.
                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.2. &lt;/var&gt;Limitations on Permissions Granted
              &lt;p&gt;
The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1:
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a) &lt;/var&gt;Licensor does not grant any 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;patent license for claims that are only infringed due 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or the combination of the Work as provided by 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;component, including other software or hardware.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b) &lt;/var&gt; Licensor does not grant any 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;this License.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4. &lt;/var&gt;Conditions
          &lt;p&gt;
If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or 
any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made 
available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a &amp;quot;Recipient&amp;quot;), 
either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You 
must comply with the following conditions: 
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1. &lt;/var&gt;Provide Access to Source Code
              &lt;p&gt;
Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a 
copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code 
corresponding to the Work (&amp;quot;Access&amp;quot;). 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
The &amp;quot;Source Code&amp;quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making 
modifications, including any comments, configuration information, 
documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds 
or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to 
independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the 
functionality contained in the Work. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.1. &lt;/var&gt;Providing Network Access to the Source Code
                  &lt;p&gt;
Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a 
third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the 
same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under 
this License and for at least one year thereafter.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.2. &lt;/var&gt;Source Code for a Modified Work
                  &lt;p&gt;
Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of 
a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the 
Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You 
to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the 
modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either 
a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;
A &amp;quot;Compatible Open Source License&amp;quot; means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.3. &lt;/var&gt;Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular 
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &amp;quot;Embargo Period&amp;quot;) if:
                  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a) &lt;/var&gt;the modification is intended to 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;address a newly-identified vulnerability or a 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;security flaw in the Work,
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b) &lt;/var&gt;disclosure of the vulnerability 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c) &lt;/var&gt;You are participating in a 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;and 
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d) &lt;/var&gt;Access to the Source Code 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;pertaining to the modification is provided to all
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period. 
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2. &lt;/var&gt;Maintain User Autonomy
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the 
Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to 
interfere with a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the 
Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&amp;apos;s own User 
Data.
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;User Data&amp;quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, 
where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of 
the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the 
Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or 
where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the 
Recipient.
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.1. &lt;/var&gt;No Withholding User Data
                  &lt;p&gt;
Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to 
You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you 
provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used 
electronic form, of the Recipient&amp;apos;s User Data in your possession, to the 
extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the 
Work.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.2. &lt;/var&gt;No Technical Measures that Limit Access
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything 
provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, 
seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other 
method, limit a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to access any functionality present in 
Recipient&amp;apos;s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control 
of the Recipient&amp;apos;s User Data.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.3. &lt;/var&gt;No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to independently 
exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power 
to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of 
the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were 
limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties 
against Recipients.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.3. &lt;/var&gt;Provide Notices and Attribution
              &lt;p&gt;
You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in 
the Source Code (the &amp;quot;Notices&amp;quot;), and provide all such Notices to each 
Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. 
Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find 
hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.4. &lt;/var&gt;Scope of Conditions in this License
              &lt;p&gt;
You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to 
those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients 
with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full 
control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide 
processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.5. &lt;/var&gt;Combined Work Exception
              &lt;p&gt;
As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source 
Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the &amp;quot;Combined 
Work Exception,&amp;quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code 
files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a &amp;quot;Larger Work.&amp;quot; So 
long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable 
Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you 
provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&amp;apos;s 
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the 
Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the 
terms of your choice.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;  
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5. &lt;/var&gt;Term and Termination
          &lt;p&gt;
The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until 
terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&amp;apos;s 
intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first 
(&amp;quot;Term&amp;quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons 
listed below. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.1. &lt;/var&gt;Effect of Termination
              &lt;p&gt;
If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You 
under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately 
cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, 
including as part of any Modified Work. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.2. &lt;/var&gt;Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
              &lt;p&gt;
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the 
conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for 
non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will 
automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the 
conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor 
or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible 
for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only 
for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of 
permissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) 
sustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent 
termination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless 
rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.3. &lt;/var&gt;Termination Due to Litigation
              &lt;p&gt;
If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, 
either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License 
shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all 
permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, 
shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory 
judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and 
enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do 
not cause termination due to litigation. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any 
kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages 
related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or 
for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the 
use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or 
any and all other commercial damages or losses.

An &amp;quot;Affiliate&amp;quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one 
or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as 
contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

              &lt;p&gt;
A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a 
Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts 
of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction 
(excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous 
notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a 
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license 
under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further 
reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&amp;apos; exercise of 
the permissions granted herein. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages 
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and costs incurred 
in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A 
&amp;quot;prevailing party&amp;quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this 
License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the 
termination of this License. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not 
constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&amp;apos;s 
ability to enforce such provision at a later time. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any 
invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent 
of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;).

The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &quot;Embargo
Period&quot;) if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.

&quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient&#39;s User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.

### 7.7. License for the Text of this License

The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that
any modifications of this license may not use the name &quot;Cryptographic
Autonomy License&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe
any derived work of this License.</pre></details></li><li><details><summary>Text:</summary><pre># The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0

You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

      ### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.

      ### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.

      ### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

   ## 5. Term and Termination

   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

      ### 5.1. Effect of Termination

      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

      ### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

      ### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.

   ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.

   ## 7. Other Provisions 

   

      ### 7.1. Affiliates

      An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

      ### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.

      ### 7.3. No Sublicensing

      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.

      ### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

      ### 7.5. No Waiver

      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

      ### 7.6. Severability

      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;).

The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &quot;Embargo
Period&quot;) if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.

&quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient&#39;s User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to 
which it applies (the &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your 
private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software 
from liability. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties 
who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated third party receives any 
part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You 
provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to 
independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss 
of data or capability due to your actions. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and 
conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that 
triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

              &lt;p&gt;
The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, 
as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by 
You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a &amp;quot;Modified Work&amp;quot;). 
Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You 
show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any 
action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any 
intellectual property right held by Licensor. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License 
places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the 
intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, 
the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You 
also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party 
beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You 
via specific performance. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of 
section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
permission to: 
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;that would infringe the non-patent intellectual 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;subject; and
                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or becomes able to license, to the extent that those 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor.
                &lt;/li&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1:
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a) &lt;/var&gt;Licensor does not grant any 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;patent license for claims that are only infringed due 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or the combination of the Work as provided by 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;component, including other software or hardware.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b) &lt;/var&gt; Licensor does not grant any 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;this License.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4. &lt;/var&gt;Conditions
          &lt;p&gt;
If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or 
any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made 
available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a &amp;quot;Recipient&amp;quot;), 
either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You 
must comply with the following conditions: 
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1. &lt;/var&gt;Provide Access to Source Code
              &lt;p&gt;
Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a 
copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code 
corresponding to the Work (&amp;quot;Access&amp;quot;). 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
The &amp;quot;Source Code&amp;quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making 
modifications, including any comments, configuration information, 
documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds 
or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to 
independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the 
functionality contained in the Work. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.1. &lt;/var&gt;Providing Network Access to the Source Code
                  &lt;p&gt;
Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a 
third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the 
same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under 
this License and for at least one year thereafter.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.2. &lt;/var&gt;Source Code for a Modified Work
                  &lt;p&gt;
Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of 
a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the 
Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You 
to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the 
modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either 
a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;
A &amp;quot;Compatible Open Source License&amp;quot; means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.1.3. &lt;/var&gt;Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular 
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &amp;quot;Embargo Period&amp;quot;) if:
                  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; a) &lt;/var&gt;the modification is intended to 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;address a newly-identified vulnerability or a 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;security flaw in the Work,
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; b) &lt;/var&gt;disclosure of the vulnerability 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; c) &lt;/var&gt;You are participating in a 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;and 
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;   + &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; d) &lt;/var&gt;Access to the Source Code 
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;pertaining to the modification is provided to all
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt;     &lt;/var&gt;Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period. 
                      &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2. &lt;/var&gt;Maintain User Autonomy
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the 
Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to 
interfere with a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the 
Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&amp;apos;s own User 
Data.
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;User Data&amp;quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, 
where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of 
the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the 
Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or 
where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the 
Recipient.
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.1. &lt;/var&gt;No Withholding User Data
                  &lt;p&gt;
Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to 
You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you 
provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used 
electronic form, of the Recipient&amp;apos;s User Data in your possession, to the 
extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the 
Work.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.2. &lt;/var&gt;No Technical Measures that Limit Access
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything 
provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, 
seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other 
method, limit a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to access any functionality present in 
Recipient&amp;apos;s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control 
of the Recipient&amp;apos;s User Data.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; #### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.2.3. &lt;/var&gt;No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access
                  &lt;p&gt;
You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&amp;apos;s ability to independently 
exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power 
to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of 
the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were 
limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties 
against Recipients.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
              
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.3. &lt;/var&gt;Provide Notices and Attribution
              &lt;p&gt;
You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in 
the Source Code (the &amp;quot;Notices&amp;quot;), and provide all such Notices to each 
Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. 
Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find 
hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.4. &lt;/var&gt;Scope of Conditions in this License
              &lt;p&gt;
You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to 
those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients 
with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full 
control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide 
processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.5. &lt;/var&gt;Combined Work Exception
              &lt;p&gt;
As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source 
Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the &amp;quot;Combined 
Work Exception,&amp;quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code 
files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a &amp;quot;Larger Work.&amp;quot; So 
long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable 
Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you 
provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&amp;apos;s 
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the 
Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the 
terms of your choice.
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;  
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5. &lt;/var&gt;Term and Termination
          &lt;p&gt;
The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until 
terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&amp;apos;s 
intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first 
(&amp;quot;Term&amp;quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons 
listed below. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:none&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.1. &lt;/var&gt;Effect of Termination
              &lt;p&gt;
If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You 
under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately 
cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, 
including as part of any Modified Work. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.2. &lt;/var&gt;Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
              &lt;p&gt;
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the 
conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for 
non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will 
automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the 
conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor 
or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible 
for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only 
for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of 
permissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) 
sustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent 
termination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless 
rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;var class=&quot;optional-license-text&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.3. &lt;/var&gt;Termination Due to Litigation
              &lt;p&gt;
If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, 
either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License 
shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all 
permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, 
shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory 
judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and 
enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do 
not cause termination due to litigation. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any 
kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages 
related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or 
for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the 
use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or 
any and all other commercial damages or losses. 
          &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
An &amp;quot;Affiliate&amp;quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one 
or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as 
contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

              &lt;p&gt;
A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a 
Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts 
of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction 
(excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous 
notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a 
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license 
under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further 
reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&amp;apos; exercise of 
the permissions granted herein. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages 
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and costs incurred 
in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A 
&amp;quot;prevailing party&amp;quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this 
License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the 
termination of this License.

              &lt;p&gt;
Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not 
constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&amp;apos;s 
ability to enforce such provision at a later time. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any 
invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent 
of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid 
or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of 
this License will remain in full force and effect. 
              &lt;/p&gt;

                    &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;# The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0\n\n*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any\nWork whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a\nsimilar demonstration of intent:*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0\n\n*or*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with\nCombined Work Exception\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the\nsoftware to which it applies (the \&quot;Work\&quot;), either as-is or in modified\nform, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and\ncontributors to the software from liability.\n\nThis License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third\nparties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third\nparty receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this\nLicense requires that You provide that third party all the permissions\nand materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without\nthat third party having a loss of data or capability due to your\nactions.\n\nThe full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n## 2. Receiving a License\n\nIn order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The\nrules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the\nLicensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with\nthe Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n### 2.1. Application\n\nThe terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from\nLicensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or\nimplementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of\nthe Work (a \&quot;Modified Work\&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the\nWork also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\nThis License is automatically offered to every person and\norganization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its\nconditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this\nLicense, would infringe any intellectual property right held by\nLicensor.\n\n### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\nAny failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License\nand infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the\nevent of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any\njurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the\nLicensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may\nenforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via\nspecific performance.\n\n## 3. Permissions\n### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\nConditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the\nlimitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent\nintellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are\nsubject; and\n\n+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to\nlicense, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as\ndistributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\nThe following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section\n3.1:\n\n+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are\nonly infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by\nLicensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,\ndirectly or indirectly, with any other component, including other\nsoftware or hardware.\n\n+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service\nmarks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply\nwith the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n## 4. Conditions\n\nIf You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the\nWork, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,\ncommunicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate\nthird party (a \&quot;Recipient\&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a\nnetwork connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each\nRecipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the\nSource Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\nThe \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for\nmaking modifications, including any comments, configuration\ninformation, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,\ncryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary\nfor the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and\nto have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\nNetwork Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You\nor by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must\npersist during the same period in which You exercise any of the\npermissions granted to You under this License and for at least one\nyear thereafter.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each\nRecipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to\nthose portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as\nthe modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source\nCode corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be\nprovided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a\nCompatible Open Source License.\n\nA “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source \nInitiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under \nthis License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be \ndistributed together as a single work.\n\n#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\nYou may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular\nmodification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo\nPeriod\&quot;) if:\n\n+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified\nvulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end\nof the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one\nor more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the\nvulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,\nand\n\n+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is\nprovided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\nIn addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access\nto the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this\nLicense to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an\nindependent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You\nprovide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n\&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the\nWork, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially\nidentical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the\nRecipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,\nan existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,\nfor, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\nThroughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions\ngranted to You under this License, You must also provide to any\nRecipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,\nprovided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User\nData in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is\navailable to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to\nanything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of\ncryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological\nprotection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s\nability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent\ncopy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the\nRecipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to\nindependently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection\nmeasures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that\nthe capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of\nenforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\nYou must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices\ncontained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such\nNotices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the\nuse of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or\nvia an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing\nAccess to Source Code.\n\n### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\nYou are required to uphold the conditions of this License only\nrelative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than\nproviding Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source\nCode, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in\nthis License requires You to provide processing services to or engage\nin network interactions with anyone.\n\n### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\nAs an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to\nSource Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having\nthe \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively\nresulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other\nSoftware into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the\nrequirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access\nto the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide\nRecipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s\nability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software\nin the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be\nlicensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n## 5. Term and Termination\n\nThe term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and\ncontinues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or\nuntil all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software\nexpire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be\nrevoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\nIf this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted\nto You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You\nwill immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this\nLicense relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\nThis License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any\nof the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination\nfor non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License\nwill automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all\nthe conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified\nby Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your\nnoncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for\nthe Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after\nbecoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the\nWork under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance\nlasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for\nnoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are\nspecifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the\nWork, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You\nby this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to\nlitigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,\ndirectly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative\nreview procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in\nresponse to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former\nLicensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due\nto litigation.\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty\nof any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone\nfor any damages related to this software or this license, under any\nkind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a\nresult of this License or the use of the Work including, without\nlimitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\nfailure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other\ncommercial damages or losses.\n\n## 7. Other Provisions\n### 7.1. Affiliates\n\nAn \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly\nthrough one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and\nnatural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services\nto Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\nA Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating\nto a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only\nin the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if\nLicensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to\nall Licensees.\n\n### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\nThis License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a\nModified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a\nlicense under the terms described in this License. You may not impose\nany further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any\nRecipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\nIn any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages\nrelating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,\nthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and\nexpenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees\nand costs incurred in connection with such action, including any\nappeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that\nachieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through\nsettlement. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n### 7.5. No Waiver\n\nAny failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will\nnot constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit\nLicensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n### 7.6. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted\nto the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a\nconstruction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion\nwill be severed from this License but the rest of this License will\nremain in full force and effect.\n\n### 7.7. License for the Text of this License\n\nThe text of this license is released under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that\nany modifications of this license may not use the name \&quot;Cryptographic\nAutonomy License\&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe\nany derived work of this License.\n&quot;,

Loss of \npermissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) \nsustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent \ntermination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless \nrights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing. \n              &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.3. &lt;/var&gt;Termination Due to Litigation\n              &lt;p&gt;\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, \neither direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly \ninfringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License \nshall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all \npermissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, \nshall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory \njudgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and \nenforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do \nnot cause termination due to litigation. \n              &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6. &lt;/var&gt;Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n          &lt;p&gt;\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any \nkind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages \nrelated to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or \nfor any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or \nconsequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the \nuse of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, \nwork stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or \nany and all other commercial damages or losses. \n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7. &lt;/var&gt;Other Provisions\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n\n   &lt;/var&gt;\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.1. &lt;/var&gt;Affiliates\n              &lt;p&gt;\nAn &amp;quot;Affiliate&amp;quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one \nor more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control \nwith, the Licensee.

        &quot;licenseText&quot;: &quot;# The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0\n\n*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any\nWork whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a\nsimilar demonstration of intent:*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0\n\n*or*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with\nCombined Work Exception\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the\nsoftware to which it applies (the \&quot;Work\&quot;), either as-is or in modified\nform, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and\ncontributors to the software from liability.\n\nThis License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third\nparties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third\nparty receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this\nLicense requires that You provide that third party all the permissions\nand materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without\nthat third party having a loss of data or capability due to your\nactions.\n\nThe full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n## 2. Receiving a License\n\nIn order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The\nrules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the\nLicensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with\nthe Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n### 2.1. Application\n\nThe terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from\nLicensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or\nimplementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of\nthe Work (a \&quot;Modified Work\&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the\nWork also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\nThis License is automatically offered to every person and\norganization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its\nconditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this\nLicense, would infringe any intellectual property right held by\nLicensor.\n\n### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\nAny failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License\nand infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the\nevent of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any\njurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the\nLicensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may\nenforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via\nspecific performance.\n\n## 3. Permissions\n### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\nConditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the\nlimitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent\nintellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are\nsubject; and\n\n+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to\nlicense, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as\ndistributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\nThe following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section\n3.1:\n\n+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are\nonly infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by\nLicensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,\ndirectly or indirectly, with any other component, including other\nsoftware or hardware.\n\n+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service\nmarks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply\nwith the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n## 4. Conditions\n\nIf You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the\nWork, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,\ncommunicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate\nthird party (a \&quot;Recipient\&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a\nnetwork connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each\nRecipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the\nSource Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\nThe \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for\nmaking modifications, including any comments, configuration\ninformation, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,\ncryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary\nfor the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and\nto have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\nNetwork Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You\nor by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must\npersist during the same period in which You exercise any of the\npermissions granted to You under this License and for at least one\nyear thereafter.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each\nRecipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to\nthose portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as\nthe modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source\nCode corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be\nprovided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a\nCompatible Open Source License.\n\nA “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source \nInitiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under \nthis License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be \ndistributed together as a single work.\n\n#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\nYou may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular\nmodification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo\nPeriod\&quot;) if:\n\n+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified\nvulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end\nof the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one\nor more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the\nvulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,\nand\n\n+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is\nprovided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\nIn addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access\nto the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this\nLicense to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an\nindependent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You\nprovide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n\&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the\nWork, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially\nidentical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the\nRecipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,\nan existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,\nfor, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\nThroughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions\ngranted to You under this License, You must also provide to any\nRecipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,\nprovided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User\nData in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is\navailable to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to\nanything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of\ncryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological\nprotection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s\nability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent\ncopy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the\nRecipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to\nindependently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection\nmeasures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that\nthe capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of\nenforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\nYou must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices\ncontained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such\nNotices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the\nuse of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or\nvia an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing\nAccess to Source Code.\n\n### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\nYou are required to uphold the conditions of this License only\nrelative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than\nproviding Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source\nCode, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in\nthis License requires You to provide processing services to or engage\nin network interactions with anyone.\n\n### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\nAs an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to\nSource Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having\nthe \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively\nresulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other\nSoftware into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the\nrequirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access\nto the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide\nRecipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s\nability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software\nin the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be\nlicensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n## 5. Term and Termination\n\nThe term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and\ncontinues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or\nuntil all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software\nexpire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be\nrevoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\nIf this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted\nto You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You\nwill immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this\nLicense relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\nThis License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any\nof the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination\nfor non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License\nwill automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all\nthe conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified\nby Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your\nnoncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for\nthe Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after\nbecoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the\nWork under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance\nlasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for\nnoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are\nspecifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the\nWork, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You\nby this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to\nlitigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,\ndirectly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative\nreview procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in\nresponse to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former\nLicensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due\nto litigation.\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty\nof any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone\nfor any damages related to this software or this license, under any\nkind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a\nresult of this License or the use of the Work including, without\nlimitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\nfailure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other\ncommercial damages or losses.\n\n## 7. Other Provisions\n### 7.1. Affiliates\n\nAn \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly\nthrough one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and\nnatural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services\nto Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\nA Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating\nto a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only\nin the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if\nLicensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to\nall Licensees.\n\n### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\nThis License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a\nModified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a\nlicense under the terms described in this License. You may not impose\nany further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any\nRecipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\nIn any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages\nrelating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,\nthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and\nexpenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees\nand costs incurred in connection with such action, including any\nappeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that\nachieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through\nsettlement. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n### 7.5. No Waiver\n\nAny failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will\nnot constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit\nLicensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n### 7.6. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted\nto the effect and intent of the original portion.

Loss of \npermissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) \nsustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent \ntermination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless \nrights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing. \n              &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.3. &lt;/var&gt;Termination Due to Litigation\n              &lt;p&gt;\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, \neither direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly \ninfringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License \nshall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all \npermissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, \nshall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory \njudgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and \nenforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do \nnot cause termination due to litigation. \n              &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          \n&lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6. &lt;/var&gt;Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n          &lt;p&gt;\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any \nkind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages \nrelated to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or \nfor any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or \nconsequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the \nuse of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, \nwork stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or \nany and all other commercial damages or losses. \n          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ## &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7. &lt;/var&gt;Other Provisions\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n\n   &lt;/var&gt;\n          \n&lt;ul style=\&quot;list-style:none\&quot;&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;var class=\&quot;optional-license-text\&quot;&gt; ### &lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 7.1. &lt;/var&gt;Affiliates\n              &lt;p&gt;\nAn &amp;quot;Affiliate&amp;quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one \nor more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control \nwith, the Licensee.

Maintain User Autonomy\n\n      In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n      \&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n         &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;####&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Provide Notices and Attribution\n\n      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Scope of Conditions in this License\n\n      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Combined Work Exception\n\n      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;##&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Term and Termination\n\n   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Effect of Termination\n\n      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\n      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination Due to Litigation\n\n      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;##&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\n   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.\n\n   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;##&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Other Provisions&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; \n\n   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Affiliates\n\n      An \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\n      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Sublicensing\n\n      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\n      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; No Waiver\n\n      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Severability\n\n      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.\n\n      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; License for the Text of this License\n\n      The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that any modifications of this license may not use the name \&quot;Cryptographic Autonomy License\&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe any derived work of this License.\n\n      &quot;

Work whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a
similar demonstration of intent:*

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;).

The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &quot;Embargo
Period&quot;) if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.

&quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient&#39;s User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.

### 7.7. License for the Text of this License

The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that
any modifications of this license may not use the name &quot;Cryptographic
Autonomy License&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;# The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0\n\n*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any\nWork whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a\nsimilar demonstration of intent:*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0\n\n*or*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with\nCombined Work Exception\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the\nsoftware to which it applies (the \&quot;Work\&quot;), either as-is or in modified\nform, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and\ncontributors to the software from liability.\n\nThis License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third\nparties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third\nparty receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this\nLicense requires that You provide that third party all the permissions\nand materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without\nthat third party having a loss of data or capability due to your\nactions.\n\nThe full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n## 2. Receiving a License\n\nIn order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The\nrules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the\nLicensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with\nthe Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n### 2.1. Application\n\nThe terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from\nLicensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or\nimplementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of\nthe Work (a \&quot;Modified Work\&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the\nWork also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\nThis License is automatically offered to every person and\norganization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its\nconditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this\nLicense, would infringe any intellectual property right held by\nLicensor.\n\n### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\nAny failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License\nand infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the\nevent of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any\njurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the\nLicensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may\nenforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via\nspecific performance.\n\n## 3. Permissions\n### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\nConditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the\nlimitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent\nintellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are\nsubject; and\n\n+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to\nlicense, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as\ndistributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\nThe following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section\n3.1:\n\n+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are\nonly infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by\nLicensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,\ndirectly or indirectly, with any other component, including other\nsoftware or hardware.\n\n+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service\nmarks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply\nwith the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n## 4. Conditions\n\nIf You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the\nWork, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,\ncommunicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate\nthird party (a \&quot;Recipient\&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a\nnetwork connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each\nRecipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the\nSource Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\nThe \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for\nmaking modifications, including any comments, configuration\ninformation, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,\ncryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary\nfor the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and\nto have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\nNetwork Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You\nor by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must\npersist during the same period in which You exercise any of the\npermissions granted to You under this License and for at least one\nyear thereafter.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each\nRecipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to\nthose portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as\nthe modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source\nCode corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be\nprovided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a\nCompatible Open Source License.\n\nA “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source \nInitiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under \nthis License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be \ndistributed together as a single work.\n\n#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\nYou may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular\nmodification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo\nPeriod\&quot;) if:\n\n+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified\nvulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end\nof the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one\nor more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the\nvulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,\nand\n\n+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is\nprovided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\nIn addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access\nto the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this\nLicense to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an\nindependent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You\nprovide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n\&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the\nWork, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially\nidentical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the\nRecipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,\nan existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,\nfor, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\nThroughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions\ngranted to You under this License, You must also provide to any\nRecipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,\nprovided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User\nData in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is\navailable to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to\nanything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of\ncryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological\nprotection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s\nability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent\ncopy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the\nRecipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to\nindependently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection\nmeasures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that\nthe capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of\nenforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\nYou must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices\ncontained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such\nNotices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the\nuse of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or\nvia an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing\nAccess to Source Code.\n\n### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\nYou are required to uphold the conditions of this License only\nrelative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than\nproviding Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source\nCode, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in\nthis License requires You to provide processing services to or engage\nin network interactions with anyone.\n\n### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\nAs an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to\nSource Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having\nthe \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively\nresulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other\nSoftware into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the\nrequirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access\nto the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide\nRecipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s\nability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software\nin the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be\nlicensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n## 5. Term and Termination\n\nThe term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and\ncontinues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or\nuntil all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software\nexpire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be\nrevoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\nIf this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted\nto You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You\nwill immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this\nLicense relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\nThis License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any\nof the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination\nfor non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License\nwill automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all\nthe conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified\nby Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your\nnoncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for\nthe Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after\nbecoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the\nWork under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance\nlasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for\nnoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are\nspecifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the\nWork, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You\nby this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to\nlitigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,\ndirectly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative\nreview procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in\nresponse to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former\nLicensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due\nto litigation.\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty\nof any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone\nfor any damages related to this software or this license, under any\nkind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a\nresult of this License or the use of the Work including, without\nlimitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\nfailure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other\ncommercial damages or losses.\n\n## 7. Other Provisions\n### 7.1. Affiliates\n\nAn \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly\nthrough one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and\nnatural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services\nto Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\nA Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating\nto a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only\nin the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if\nLicensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to\nall Licensees.\n\n### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\nThis License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a\nModified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a\nlicense under the terms described in this License. You may not impose\nany further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any\nRecipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\nIn any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages\nrelating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,\nthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and\nexpenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees\nand costs incurred in connection with such action, including any\nappeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that\nachieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through\nsettlement. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n### 7.5. No Waiver\n\nAny failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will\nnot constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit\nLicensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n### 7.6. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted\nto the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a\nconstruction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion\nwill be severed from this License but the rest of this License will\nremain in full force and effect.\n\n### 7.7. License for the Text of this License\n\nThe text of this license is released under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that\nany modifications of this license may not use the name \&quot;Cryptographic\nAutonomy License\&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe\nany derived work of this License.&quot;,

Purpose\n\nThis License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the\nsoftware to which it applies (the \&quot;Work\&quot;), either as-is or in modified\nform, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and\ncontributors to the software from liability.\n\nThis License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third\nparties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third\nparty receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this\nLicense requires that You provide that third party all the permissions\nand materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without\nthat third party having a loss of data or capability due to your\nactions.\n\nThe full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n## 2. Receiving a License\n\nIn order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The\nrules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the\nLicensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with\nthe Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n### 2.1. Application\n\nThe terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from\nLicensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or\nimplementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of\nthe Work (a \&quot;Modified Work\&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the\nWork also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\nThis License is automatically offered to every person and\norganization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its\nconditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this\nLicense, would infringe any intellectual property right held by\nLicensor.\n\n### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\nAny failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License\nand infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the\nevent of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any\njurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the\nLicensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may\nenforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via\nspecific performance.\n\n## 3. Permissions\n### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\nConditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the\nlimitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent\nintellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are\nsubject; and\n\n+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to\nlicense, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as\ndistributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\nThe following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section\n3.1:\n\n+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are\nonly infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by\nLicensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,\ndirectly or indirectly, with any other component, including other\nsoftware or hardware.\n\n+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service\nmarks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply\nwith the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n## 4. Conditions\n\nIf You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the\nWork, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,\ncommunicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate\nthird party (a \&quot;Recipient\&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a\nnetwork connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each\nRecipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the\nSource Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\nThe \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for\nmaking modifications, including any comments, configuration\ninformation, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,\ncryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary\nfor the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and\nto have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\nNetwork Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You\nor by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must\npersist during the same period in which You exercise any of the\npermissions granted to You under this License and for at least one\nyear thereafter.\n\n#### 4.1.2.

Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\nYou may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular\nmodification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo\nPeriod\&quot;) if:\n\n+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified\nvulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end\nof the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one\nor more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the\nvulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,\nand\n\n+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is\nprovided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\nIn addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access\nto the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this\nLicense to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an\nindependent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You\nprovide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n\&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the\nWork, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially\nidentical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the\nRecipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,\nan existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,\nfor, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\nThroughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions\ngranted to You under this License, You must also provide to any\nRecipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,\nprovided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User\nData in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is\navailable to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to\nanything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of\ncryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological\nprotection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s\nability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent\ncopy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the\nRecipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to\nindependently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection\nmeasures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that\nthe capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of\nenforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\nYou must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices\ncontained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such\nNotices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the\nuse of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or\nvia an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing\nAccess to Source Code.\n\n### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\nYou are required to uphold the conditions of this License only\nrelative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than\nproviding Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source\nCode, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in\nthis License requires You to provide processing services to or engage\nin network interactions with anyone.\n\n### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\nAs an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to\nSource Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having\nthe \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively\nresulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other\nSoftware into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the\nrequirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access\nto the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide\nRecipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s\nability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software\nin the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be\nlicensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n## 5. Term and Termination\n\nThe term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and\ncontinues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or\nuntil all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software\nexpire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be\nrevoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\nIf this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted\nto You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate.

You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for\nthe Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after\nbecoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the\nWork under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance\nlasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for\nnoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are\nspecifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the\nWork, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You\nby this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to\nlitigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,\ndirectly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative\nreview procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in\nresponse to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former\nLicensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due\nto litigation.\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty\nof any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone\nfor any damages related to this software or this license, under any\nkind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a\nresult of this License or the use of the Work including, without\nlimitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\nfailure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other\ncommercial damages or losses.\n\n## 7. Other Provisions\n### 7.1. Affiliates\n\nAn \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly\nthrough one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and\nnatural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services\nto Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\nA Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating\nto a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only\nin the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if\nLicensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to\nall Licensees.\n\n### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\nThis License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a\nModified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a\nlicense under the terms described in this License. You may not impose\nany further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any\nRecipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\nIn any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages\nrelating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,\nthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and\nexpenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees\nand costs incurred in connection with such action, including any\nappeal of such action.

This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n### 7.5. No Waiver\n\nAny failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will\nnot constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit\nLicensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n### 7.6. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable.

   ## 1. Purpose

   This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software from liability.

   This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your actions.

   The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

   ## 2. Receiving a License

   In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

      ### 2.1. Application

      The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

      ### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

      This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by Licensor.

      ### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

      Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via specific performance.

   ## 3. Permissions 

   

      ### 3.1. Permissions Granted

      Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

         + a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject; and

         + b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.

      ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

      The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1:

         

         + a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other software or hardware.

         

         + b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

   ## 4. Conditions

   If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the following conditions:

      ### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

      Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;).

      The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications, including any comments, configuration information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

         #### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

         Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one year thereafter.

         #### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

         You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the &quot;Embargo Period&quot;) if:

            

            + a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

            

            + b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

            

            + c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, and

            

            + d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

      ### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

      In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.

      &quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

         #### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

         Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

         #### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

         You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the Recipient&#39;s User Data.

         #### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

         You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

      ### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the &quot;Notices&quot;), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.

      ### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.

      ### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the &quot;Combined Work Exception,&quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a &quot;Larger Work.&quot; So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

   ## 5. Term and Termination

   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (&quot;Term&quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

      ### 5.1. Effect of Termination

      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

      ### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

      ### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.

   ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.

      ### 7.1. Affiliates

      An &quot;Affiliate&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

      ### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.

      ### 7.3. No Sublicensing

      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License.

      ### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees

      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A &quot;prevailing party&quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

      ### 7.5. No Waiver

      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

      ### 7.6. Severability

      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.

            &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;# The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0\n\n*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the \&quot;License\&quot;) applies to any Work whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a similar demonstration of intent: *\n\n\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0\n\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0\n\n\n\n*or*\n\n\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception\n\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with Combined Work Exception\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n   ## 1. Purpose\n\n   This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to which it applies (the \&quot;Work\&quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software from liability.\n\n   This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your actions.\n\n   The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n   ## 2. Receiving a License\n\n   In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n      ### 2.1. Application\n\n      The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a \&quot;Modified Work\&quot;). Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n      ### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\n      This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by Licensor.\n\n      ### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\n      Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via specific performance.\n\n   ## 3. Permissions \n\n   \n\n      ### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\n      Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n         + a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject; and\n\n         + b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.\n\n      ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\n      The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1:\n\n         \n\n         + a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other software or hardware.\n\n         \n\n         + b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n   ## 4. Conditions\n\n   If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a \&quot;Recipient\&quot;), either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the following conditions:\n\n      ### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\n      Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\n      The \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications, including any comments, configuration information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n         #### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\n         Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one year thereafter.\n\n         #### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work\n\n         Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.\n\n         #### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\n         You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo Period\&quot;) if:\n\n            \n\n            + a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n            \n\n            + b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n            \n\n            + c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, and\n\n            \n\n            + d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n      ### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\n      In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n      \&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n         #### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\n         Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n         #### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\n         You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the Recipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n         #### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\n         You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n      ### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\n      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.\n\n      ### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\n      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.\n\n      ### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\n      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n   ## 5. Term and Termination\n\n   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n      ### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\n      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n      ### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\n      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n      ### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\n      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.\n\n   ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\n   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.\n\n   ## 7. Other Provisions \n\n   \n\n      ### 7.1. Affiliates\n\n      An \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n      ### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\n      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.\n\n      ### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\n      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n      ### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\n      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n      ### 7.5. No Waiver\n\n      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n      ### 7.6. Severability\n\n      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.\n\n      ### 7.7. License for the Text of this License\n\n      The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that any modifications of this license may not use the name \&quot;Cryptographic Autonomy License\&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe any derived work of this License.&quot;,

Receiving a License\n\n   In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules.

Compliance and Remedies\n\n      Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via specific performance.\n\n   ## 3. Permissions \n\n   \n\n      ### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\n      Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n         + a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject; and\n\n         + b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.\n\n      ### 3.2.

Provide Access to Source Code\n\n      Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code corresponding to the Work (\&quot;Access\&quot;).\n\n      The \&quot;Source Code\&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications, including any comments, configuration information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n         #### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\n         Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one year thereafter.\n\n         #### 4.1.2.

Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\n         You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \&quot;Embargo Period\&quot;) if:\n\n            \n\n            + a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n            \n\n            + b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n            \n\n            + c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, and\n\n            \n\n            + d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n      ### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\n      In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to interfere with a Recipient&#39;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&#39;s own User Data.\n\n      \&quot;User Data\&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n         #### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\n         Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient&#39;s User Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n         #### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\n         You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient&#39;s ability to access any functionality present in Recipient&#39;s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the Recipient&#39;s User Data.\n\n         #### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\n         You may not contractually restrict a Recipient&#39;s ability to independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n      ### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\n      You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the \&quot;Notices\&quot;), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.\n\n      ### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\n      You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.\n\n      ### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\n      As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the \&quot;Combined Work Exception,\&quot; or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a \&quot;Larger Work.\&quot; So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient&#39;s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n   ## 5. Term and Termination\n\n   The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor&#39;s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (\&quot;Term\&quot;). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n      ### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\n      If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n      ### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\n      This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n      ### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\n      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.\n\n   ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\n   As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.\n\n   ## 7. Other Provisions \n\n   \n\n      ### 7.1. Affiliates\n\n      An \&quot;Affiliate\&quot; means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n      ### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\n      A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.\n\n      ### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\n      This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients&#39; exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n      ### 7.4. Attorneys&#39; Fees\n\n      In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A \&quot;prevailing party\&quot; is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n      ### 7.5. No Waiver\n\n      Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor&#39;s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n      ### 7.6. Severability\n\n      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.\n\n      ### 7.7. License for the Text of this License\n\n      The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that any modifications of this license may not use the name \&quot;Cryptographic Autonomy License\&quot; or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe any derived work of this License.&quot;,
