EUPL (c) the European Community 2007

This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

     Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

     - The Licence: this Licence.

     - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

     - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

     - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

     - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.

     - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

     - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.

     - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

     - The Licensee or &quot;You&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.

     - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:

     - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,

     - reproduce the Work,

     - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,

     - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,

     - distribute the Work or copies thereof,

     - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,

     - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, &quot;Compatible Licence,&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot; inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

     - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;

                         Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country

&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        reproduce the Work,
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,

&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or
                         copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,
                    &lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later
                 invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his

                &lt;p&gt;The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents
                 held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the
                 Work under this Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
                Communication of the Source Code
                &lt;p&gt;The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the
                 Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy
                 of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes
                 or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
                 where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to
                 distribute and/or communicate the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
                Limitations on copyright
                &lt;p&gt;Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or
                 limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of
                 the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
                Obligations of the Licensee
                &lt;p&gt;The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed
                 on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and
                 all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
                 include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she
                 distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
                 prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or
                 Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
                 done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original
                 Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming
                 Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative
                 Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies
                 thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible
                 Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible
                 Licence. For the sake of this clause, &amp;quot;Compatible Licence,&amp;quot; refers to the licences listed in
                 the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&amp;apos;s obligations under the Compatible
                 Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
                 Compatible Licence shall prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
                 will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
                 Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
                 and/or communicate the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                 service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
                 in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
                Chain of Authorship
                &lt;p&gt;The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned
                 by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the
                 Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are
                 owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant
                 the Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a
                 licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
                Disclaimer of Warranty
                &lt;p&gt;The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is
                 not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; inherent to this type of
                 software development.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis and without
                 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability,

                 construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this
                 Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights
                 granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version

EUPL © the European Community 2007 
 
This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software 
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the 
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use 
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 
 
The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as 
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright 
notice for the Original Work: 
 
Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 
 
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. 
 
1. Definitions 
 
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: 
 
- The Licence: this Licence. 
 
- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated 
by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable 
Code as the case may be. 
 
- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, 
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define 
the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to

Work under the Licence. 
 
- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the 
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

Software under the terms of the Licence. 
 
- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, 
distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or 
off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the 
disposal of any other natural or legal person. 
 
2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence 
 
The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub- 
licensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the 
Original Work: 
 
- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, 
- reproduce the Work, 
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,

Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, 
the Work, 
- distribute the Work or copies thereof, 
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, 
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. 
 
Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now 
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. 
 
In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his 
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the 
economic rights here above listed. 
 
The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any 
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted 
on the Work under this Licence. 
 
3. Communication of the Source Code 
 
The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable 
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a 
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the 
Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright 
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely 
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the 
Work. 
   
4. Limitations on copyright 
 
Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any 
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original 
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations 
thereto. 
 
5. Obligations of the Licensee 
 
The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations 
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: 
 
Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks 
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. 
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with 
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must 
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been 
modified and the date of modification. 
 
Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the 
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution 
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later 
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under 
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose 
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or 
restrict the terms of the Licence. 
 
Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative 
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work  
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be 
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, 
&quot;Compatible Licence&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this 
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict 
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence 
shall prevail.  
 
Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the 
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or 
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long 
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 
 
Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for 
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the copyright notice. 
 
6. Chain of Authorship 
 
The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted 
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power 
and authority to grant the Licence. 
 
Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the 
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and 
authority to grant the Licence. 
 
Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors 
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this 
Licence. 
 
7. Disclaimer of Warranty 
 
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous 
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot; 
inherent to this type of software development. 
 
For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and 
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, 
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as 
stated in Article 6 of this Licence. 
 
This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the 
grant of any rights to the Work. 
 
8. Disclaimer of Liability 
 
Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural 
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or 
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, 
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be 
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 
 
9. Additional agreements 
 
While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to 
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this 
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own 
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any 
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each 
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such 
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 

10. Acceptance of the Licence

affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable 
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this

least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding

reproduced by the Licensee. 
 
12. Termination of the Licence 
 
The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any

Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full 
compliance with the Licence.  
 
13. Miscellaneous 
 
Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement 
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. 
 
If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this 
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision 
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 
 
The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions 
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of 
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with 
a unique version number. 
 
All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have 
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

     - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;

     - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.

                         Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country

&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,

&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        reproduce the Work,
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or
                         copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                    
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                        distribute the Work or copies thereof,
                    &lt;/li&gt;

                        sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later
                 invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his

                 economic rights here above listed.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents
                 held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the
                 Work under this Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
                Communication of the Source Code
                &lt;p&gt;The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the
                 Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy
                 of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes
                 or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
                 where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to
                 distribute and/or communicate the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
                Limitations on copyright
                &lt;p&gt;Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or
                 limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of
                 the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
                Obligations of the Licensee
                &lt;p&gt;The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed
                 on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and
                 all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
                 include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she
                 distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
                 prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or
                 Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
                 done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original
                 Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming
                 Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative
                 Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies
                 thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible
                 Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible
                 Licence. For the sake of this clause, &amp;quot;Compatible Licence,&amp;quot; refers to the licences listed in
                 the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&amp;apos;s obligations under the Compatible
                 Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
                 Compatible Licence shall prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
                 will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
                 Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
                 and/or communicate the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                 service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
                 in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
                Chain of Authorship
                &lt;p&gt;The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned
                 by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the
                 Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are
                 owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant
                 the Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a
                 licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
                Disclaimer of Warranty
                &lt;p&gt;The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is
                 not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; inherent to this type of
                 software development.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis and without
                 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability,
                 fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of
                 intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of
                 any rights to the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class=&quot;replaceable-license-text&quot;&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
                Disclaimer of Liability
                &lt;p&gt;Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the
                 Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of
                 any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation,
                 damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or
                 any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
                 damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far
                 such laws apply to the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

                Additional agreements
                &lt;p&gt;While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an
                 additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                 indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence.
                 However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
                 responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if
                 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
                 by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such
                 warranty or additional liability.&lt;/p&gt;

Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).\n\nThe Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:\n\n     Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1\n\nor has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.\n\n1. Definitions\n\nIn this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:\n\n     - The Licence: this Licence.\n\n     - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.\n\n     - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.\n\n     - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.\n\n     - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.\n\n     - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\n\n     - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.\n\n     - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.\n\n     - The Licensee or \&quot;You\&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.\n\n     - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.\n\n2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence\n\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:\n\n     - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,\n\n     - reproduce the Work,\n\n     - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,\n\n     - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,\n\n     - distribute the Work or copies thereof,\n\n     - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,\n\n     - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.\n\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\n\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\n\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\n\n3. Communication of the Source Code\n\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n4. Limitations on copyright\n\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.\n\n5. Obligations of the Licensee\n\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n\nAttribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\n\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \&quot;Compatible Licence,\&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n6. Chain of Authorship\n\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \&quot;bugs\&quot; inherent to this type of software development.\n\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \&quot;as is\&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\n\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n9. Additional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \&quot;I agree\&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n11. Information to the public\n\nIn case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n\n12. Termination of the Licence\n\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n13. Miscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\n\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value.

If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n4. Limitations on copyright\n\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.\n\n5. Obligations of the Licensee\n\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n\nAttribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\n\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \&quot;Compatible Licence,\&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n6. Chain of Authorship\n\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \&quot;bugs\&quot; inherent to this type of software development.\n\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \&quot;as is\&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\n\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n9. Additional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \&quot;I agree\&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n11. Information to the public\n\nIn case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n\n12. Termination of the Licence\n\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n13. Miscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\n\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.\n\n14. Jurisdiction\n\nAny litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n\nAny litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.\n\n15. Applicable Law\n\nThis Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.\n\nThis licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:\n\n     - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;\n\n     - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\&quot;Compatible Licences\&quot; according to article 5 EUPL are:\n\n     - GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2\n     - Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0\n     - Common Public License v. 1.0\n     - Eclipse Public License v. 1.0\n     - Cecill v. 2.0\n&quot;,

Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\n   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Chain of Authorship\n\n   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\n   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\n   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \&quot;bugs\&quot; inherent to this type of software development.\n\n   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \&quot;as is\&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n\n   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Liability\n\n   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional agreements\n\n   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance of the Licence\n\n   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \&quot;I agree\&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Information to the public\n\n   In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;12.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination of the Licence\n\n   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;13.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous\n\n   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\n\n   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\n   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\n   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;14.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Jurisdiction\n\n   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n\n   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;15.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Applicable Law\n\n   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.\n\n   This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;\n\n      &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.\n\nAppendix\n\n\&quot;Compatible Licences\&quot; according to article 5 EUPL are:\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Common Public License v. 1.0\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Eclipse Public License v. 1.0\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;-\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt; Cecill v. 2.0&quot;

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.&quot;,

V. 1.1 
 
EUPL © the European Community 2007 
 
This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software 
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the 
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use 
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 
 
The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as 
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright 
notice for the Original Work: 
 
Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 
 
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. 
 
1. Definitions 
 
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: 
 
- The Licence: this Licence. 
 
- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated 
by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable 
Code as the case may be. 
 
- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, 
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define 
the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to 
classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law 
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.  
 
- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works. 
 
- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most 
convenient for people to study and modify. 
 
- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is 
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. 
 
- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the 
Work under the Licence. 
 
- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the 
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. 
 
- The Licensee or &quot;You&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the 
Software under the terms of the Licence. 
 
- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, 
distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or 
off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the 
disposal of any other natural or legal person. 
 
2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence 
 
The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub- 
licensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the 
Original Work: 
 
- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, 
- reproduce the Work, 
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, 
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the 
Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, 
the Work, 
- distribute the Work or copies thereof, 
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, 
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. 
 
Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now 
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. 
 
In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his 
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the 
economic rights here above listed. 
 
The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any 
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted 
on the Work under this Licence. 
 
3. Communication of the Source Code 
 
The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable 
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a 
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the 
Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright 
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely 
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the 
Work. 
   
4. Limitations on copyright 
 
Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any 
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original 
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations 
thereto. 
 
5. Obligations of the Licensee 
 
The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations 
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: 
 
Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks 
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. 
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with 
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must 
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been 
modified and the date of modification. 
 
Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the 
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution 
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later 
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under 
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose 
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or 
restrict the terms of the Licence. 
 
Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative 
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work  
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be 
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, 
&quot;Compatible Licence&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this 
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict 
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence 
shall prevail.  
 
Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the 
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or 
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long 
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 
 
Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for 
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the copyright notice. 
 
6. Chain of Authorship 
 
The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted 
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power 
and authority to grant the Licence. 
 
Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the 
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and 
authority to grant the Licence. 
 
Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors 
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this 
Licence. 
 
7. Disclaimer of Warranty 
 
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous 
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot; 
inherent to this type of software development. 
 
For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and 
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, 
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as 
stated in Article 6 of this Licence. 
 
This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the 
grant of any rights to the Work. 
 
8. Disclaimer of Liability 
 
Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural 
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or 
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, 
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be 
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 
 
9. Additional agreements 
 
While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to 
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this 
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own 
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any 
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each 
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such 
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 

10. Acceptance of the Licence 
 
The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot; 
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by 
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable 
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this 
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.  
 
Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by 
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of 
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or 
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.  
 
11. Information to the public 
 
In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic 
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a 
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at 
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding 
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and 
reproduced by the Licensee. 
 
12. Termination of the Licence 
 
The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. 
 
Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the 
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full 
compliance with the Licence.  
 
13. Miscellaneous 
 
Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement 
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. 
 
If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this 
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision 
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 
 
The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions 
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of 
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with 
a unique version number. 
 
All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have 
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.  
   
14. Jurisdiction 
 
Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the 
European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in 
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 
 
Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and 
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary 
business. 
 
15. Applicable Law 
 
This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the 
Licensor resides or has his registered office. 
 
This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: 
 
- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any 
Licensee; 
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or 
registered office inside a European Union country.</pre></details></li></ul><details><summary>JSON:</summary><pre>{

This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

   

   Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

   

   or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.

   1. Definitions

   In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

      - The Licence: this Licence.

      - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

      - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

      - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

      - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.

      - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

      - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.

      - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

      - The Licensee or &quot;You&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.

      - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.

   2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

   The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:

      - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,

      - reproduce the Work,

      - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,

      - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,

      - distribute the Work or copies thereof,

      - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,

      - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

   Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

   In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

   The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

   3. Communication of the Source Code

   The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

   4. Limitations on copyright

   Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

   5. Obligations of the Licensee

   The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

   Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, &quot;Compatible Licence,&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

   6. Chain of Authorship

   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty

   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot; inherent to this type of software development.

   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

   8. Disclaimer of Liability

   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

   9. Additional agreements

   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.

   10. Acceptance of the Licence

   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

   11. Information to the public

   In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

   12. Termination of the Licence

   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

   13. Miscellaneous

   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

   14. Jurisdiction

   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.

   15. Applicable Law

   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

   This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

      - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;

      - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.

        &quot;_rf_text&quot;: &quot;European Union Public Licence V. 1.1 EUPL (c) the European Community 2007\n\nThis European Union Public Licence (the \&quot;EUPL\&quot;) applies to the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).\n\nThe Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:\n\n   \n\n   Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1\n\n   \n\n   or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.\n\n   1. Definitions\n\n   In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:\n\n      - The Licence: this Licence.\n\n      - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.\n\n      - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.\n\n      - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.\n\n      - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.\n\n      - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\n\n      - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.\n\n      - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.\n\n      - The Licensee or \&quot;You\&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.\n\n      - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.\n\n   2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence\n\n   The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:\n\n      - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,\n\n      - reproduce the Work,\n\n      - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,\n\n      - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,\n\n      - distribute the Work or copies thereof,\n\n      - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,\n\n      - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.\n\n   Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\n\n   In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\n\n   The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\n\n   3. Communication of the Source Code\n\n   The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n   4. Limitations on copyright\n\n   Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.\n\n   5. Obligations of the Licensee\n\n   The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n\n   Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\n\n   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\n   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \&quot;Compatible Licence,\&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\n   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n   6. Chain of Authorship\n\n   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\n   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\n   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \&quot;bugs\&quot; inherent to this type of software development.\n\n   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \&quot;as is\&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n\n   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n   8. Disclaimer of Liability\n\n   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n   9. Additional agreements\n\n   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   10. Acceptance of the Licence\n\n   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \&quot;I agree\&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n   11. Information to the public\n\n   In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n\n   12. Termination of the Licence\n\n   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n   13. Miscellaneous\n\n   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\n\n   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\n   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\n   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.\n\n   14. Jurisdiction\n\n   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n\n   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.\n\n   15. Applicable Law\n\n   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.\n\n   This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:\n\n      - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;\n\n      - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.\n\nAppendix\n\n\&quot;Compatible Licences\&quot; according to article 5 EUPL are:\n\n   - GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2\n\n   - Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0\n\n   - Common Public License v. 1.0\n\n   - Eclipse Public License v. 1.0\n\n   - Cecill v. 2.0&quot;,

            &quot;_fossLight_LICENSE_TEXT&quot;: &quot;European Union Public Licence V. 1.1\n\nEUPL (c) the European Community 2007\n\nThis European Union Public Licence (the \&quot;EUPL\&quot;) applies to the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).\n\nThe Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work: \n\n     Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 \n\nor has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.\n\n1. Definitions\n\nIn this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:\n\n     - The Licence: this Licence.\n\n     - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.\n\n     - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.\n\n     - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.\n\n     - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.\n\n     - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\n\n     - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.\n\n     - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.\n\n     - The Licensee or \&quot;You\&quot;: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.\n\n     - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.\n\n2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence\n\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:\n\n     - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, \n\n     - reproduce the Work, \n\n     - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, \n\n     - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, \n\n     - distribute the Work or copies thereof, \n\n     - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, \n\n     - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.\n\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\n\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\n\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\n\n3. Communication of the Source Code\n\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\n4. Limitations on copyright\n\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.\n\n5. Obligations of the Licensee\n\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n\nAttribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\n\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \&quot;Compatible Licence,\&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\n\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n6. Chain of Authorship\n\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \&quot;bugs\&quot; inherent to this type of software development.\n\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \&quot;as is\&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\n\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n9. Additional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \&quot;I agree\&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n11. Information to the public\n\nIn case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n\n12. Termination of the Licence\n\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n13. Miscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\n\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.\n\n14. Jurisdiction\n\nAny litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n\nAny litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.\n\n15. Applicable Law\n\nThis Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.\n\nThis licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:\n\n     - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee; \n\n     - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\&quot;Compatible Licences\&quot; according to article 5 EUPL are: \n\n     - GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2 \n     - Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0 \n     - Common Public License v. 1.0 \n     - Eclipse Public License v. 1.0 \n     - Cecill v. 2.0&quot;,

V. 1.1

EUPL © the European Community 2007

This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to the Work or Software
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

- The Licence: this Licence.

- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated
by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
Code as the case may be.

- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee,
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define
the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to
classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
convenient for people to study and modify.

- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the
Work under the Licence.

- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

- The Licensee or “You”: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the
Software under the terms of the Licence.

- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting,
distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or
off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the
disposal of any other natural or legal person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable
licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the
Original Work:

- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
- reproduce the Work,
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the
Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be,
the Work,
- distribute the Work or copies thereof,
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the
economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted
on the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the
Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the
Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations
thereto.

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been
modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or
restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
“Compatible Licence” refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence
shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
the content of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power
and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and
authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this
Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs”
inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as
stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the
grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree”
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and
reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full
compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with
a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the
European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
business.

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the
Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any
Licensee;
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
registered office inside a European Union country.
