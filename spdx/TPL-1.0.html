0. Notes of Origin

0.1 As required by paragraph 6.3 of the &quot;Mozilla Public Licence&quot;,
&quot;MPL&quot; in the following, it is hereby stated that this Licence
condition (&quot;TPL&quot;) differs in the following items from the original
&quot;Mozilla Public Licence&quot; as provided by &quot;Netscape Communications
Corporation&quot;:

a) Paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of the MPL has been modified to bind licence
modifications to the Author of this Licence, Thomas Richter.

b) Paragraph 11 has been modified to gover this Licence by German
law rather than Californian Law.

c) The licence has been renamed to &quot;TPL&quot; and &quot;THOR Public
Licence&quot;. All references towards &quot;MPL&quot; have been removed except in
section 0 to indicate the difference from &quot;MPL&quot;.

No other modifications have been made.

1.0.1. &quot;Commercial Use&quot; means distribution or otherwise making the
Covered Code available to a third party.

1.1. &quot;Contributor&quot; means each entity that creates or contributes to
the creation of Modifications.

1.2. &quot;Contributor Version&quot; means the combination of the Original Code,
prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made
by that particular Contributor.

1.3. &quot;Covered Code&quot; means the Original Code or Modifications or the
combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
including portions thereof.

1.4. &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot; means a mechanism generally
accepted in the software development community for the electronic
transfer of data.

1.5. &quot;Executable&quot; means Covered Code in any form other than Source
Code.

1.6. &quot;Initial Developer&quot; means the individual or entity identified as
the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

1.7. &quot;Larger Work&quot; means a work which combines Covered Code or
portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.8. &quot;License&quot; means this document.

1.8.1. &quot;Licensable&quot; means having the right to grant, to the maximum
extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or
subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights conveyed herein.

1.9. &quot;Modifications&quot; means any addition to or deletion from the
substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
Modification is: A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a
file containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
previous Modifications.
 
1.10. &quot;Original Code&quot; means Source Code of computer software code

any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code
differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor&#39;s choice. The
Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
for no charge.

1.12. &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) means an individual or a legal entity
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
License or a future version of this License issued under Section
6.1. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity which controls, is

2. Source Code License.

2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.  The Initial Developer hereby grants
You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to
third party intellectual property claims: (a) under intellectual
property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial
Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for
sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions
thereof).  

(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under
the terms of this License.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i)
the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
Original Code with other software or devices.
 
2.2. Contributor Grant.  Subject to third party intellectual property
claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license
 
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created
by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified
basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a
Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination).

(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered
Code.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for
infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor
Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that
Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor
Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by
Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or to
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may
include an additional document offering the additional rights
described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create
or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code to
which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims.  If
Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
&quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.  If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an
application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 
(c) Representations.  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.


3.5. Required Notices.  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You
created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where
You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute Covered
Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5
have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and
where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39;
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set
forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under
a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.  Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.  Once Covered Code has been published
under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to
use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Thomas Richter. No one other than Thomas Richter
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of
this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which
is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;TPL&quot;, &quot;THOR Software&quot;,
&quot;Thomas Richter&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in
your license (except to note that your license differs from this
License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the
license contains terms which differ from the THOR Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code
or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty
for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
the 60 day notice period specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant.

8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot;
and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
German law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,

                  Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                  granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
                  the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
                  Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
                  modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination
                  of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
                  software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
                  devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code
                  in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Application of License. The Modifications which You create
                  or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                  this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
                  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
                  only under the terms of this License or a future version
                  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
                  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
                  Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
                  on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
                  applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights
                  hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
                  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You
                  create or to which You contribute must be made available
                  in Source Code form under the terms of this License
                  either on the same media as an Executable version or via
                  an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                  to whom you made an Executable version available; and
                  if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
                  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
                  after the date it initially became available, or at
                  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that
                  particular Modification has been made available to such
                  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the
                  Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
                  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered
                  Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting
                  the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
                  the date of any change. You must include a prominent
                  statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
                  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer
                  in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                  Executable version or related documentation in which You
                  describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If
                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                  party&amp;apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise
                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                  Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the
                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received
                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include
                  an application programming interface and Contributor
                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)
                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
                  believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s
                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due
                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would
                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or
                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor
                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                  Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership
                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,
                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if
                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                  License, including a description of how and where You have
                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                  describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.
                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                  limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code
                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
                  distribute the Executable version under a different license
                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
                  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of
                  this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
                  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
                  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
                  Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation
                  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
                  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
                  be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
                  must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
                  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
                  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
                  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  This License applies to code to which the
                  Initial Developer has attached the notice
                  in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  New Versions. Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or
                  new versions of the License from time to time. Each
                  version will be given a distinguishing version number.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published
                  under a particular version of the License, You may always
                  continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
                  also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
                  subsequent version of the License published by Thomas Richter.
                  No one other than Thomas Richter has the right to modify the
                  terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version
                  of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it
                  to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
                  License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
                  &amp;quot;TPL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;THOR Software&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Thomas Richter&amp;quot; or any confusingly
                  similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to
                  note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
                  otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                  contains terms which differ from the THOR Public License.
                  (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code
                  or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not
                  of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

                  RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
                  IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN

                  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
                  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
                  AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
                  CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

                  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

                  fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware
                  of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
                  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
                  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
                  effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

                  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
                  infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
                  against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
                  Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
                  action is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:

                  such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
                  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
                  such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
                  License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                  prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
                  notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
                  a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
                  future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
                  withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
                  Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice,
                  a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
                  agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
                  is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
                  under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at
                  the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

                  Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
                  infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
                  Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective
                  as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed,

                  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
                  alleging that such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly
                  or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
                  resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
                  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
                  reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
                  under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
                  determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

                  held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed

                  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect

                  that the language of a contract shall be construed
                  against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.

8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS &quot;PARTICIPANT&quot;) ALLEGING THAT:

a. such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT&#39;S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.

8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.

9. Limitation of Liability

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or to
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may
include an additional document offering the additional rights
described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create
or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code to
which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims.  If
Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
&quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.  If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an
application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 
(c) Representations.  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.


3.5. Required Notices.  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You
created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where
You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute Covered
Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5
have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and
where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39;
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set
forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under
a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.  Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.  Once Covered Code has been published
under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to
use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Thomas Richter. No one other than Thomas Richter
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of
this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which
is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;TPL&quot;, &quot;THOR Software&quot;,
&quot;Thomas Richter&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in
your license (except to note that your license differs from this
License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the
license contains terms which differ from the THOR Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code
or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty
for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
the 60 day notice period specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant.

8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot;
and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
German law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
entity chartered or registered to do business in Federal Republic of
Germany, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Federal Republic of
Germany, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and
expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer
permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice
of the TPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

                  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license
                  is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original

                  non-exclusive license (a) under intellectual property
                  rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
                  by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display,
                  perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
                  created by such Contributor (or portions thereof)
                  either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications,

                  combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
                  its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

                  Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is

                  the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
                  Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
                  modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination
                  of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
                  software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
                  devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code
                  in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

                  Application of License. The Modifications which You create
                  or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                  this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
                  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
                  only under the terms of this License or a future version
                  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
                  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
                  Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
                  on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
                  applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights
                  hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
                  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You
                  create or to which You contribute must be made available
                  in Source Code form under the terms of this License
                  either on the same media as an Executable version or via
                  an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                  to whom you made an Executable version available; and
                  if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
                  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
                  after the date it initially became available, or at
                  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that
                  particular Modification has been made available to such
                  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the
                  Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
                  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered
                  Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting
                  the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
                  the date of any change. You must include a prominent
                  statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
                  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer
                  in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                  Executable version or related documentation in which You
                  describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If
                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                  party&amp;apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise
                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                  Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the
                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received
                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include
                  an application programming interface and Contributor
                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)
                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
                  believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s
                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due
                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would
                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or
                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor
                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                  Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership
                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,
                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if
                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                  License, including a description of how and where You have
                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                  describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.
                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                  limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code
                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
                  distribute the Executable version under a different license
                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
                  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of
                  this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
                  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
                  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
                  Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation
                  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
                  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
                  be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
                  must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
                  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
                  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
                  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  This License applies to code to which the
                  Initial Developer has attached the notice
                  in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
               &lt;/p&gt;

                  New Versions. Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or
                  new versions of the License from time to time. Each
                  version will be given a distinguishing version number.

                  Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published
                  under a particular version of the License, You may always
                  continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
                  also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
                  subsequent version of the License published by Thomas Richter.
                  No one other than Thomas Richter has the right to modify the
                  terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

                  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
                  infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
                  against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial

                  such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
                  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
                  such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
                  License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                  prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
                  notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
                  a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
                  future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
                  withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor

                  agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
                  is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
                  under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at
                  the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

                  under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in

The Source Code version of\nCovered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and\nYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\nCode You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\nthis License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create\nor to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form\nunder the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code to\nwhich You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You\nmade to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must\ninclude a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\nDeveloper and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the\nSource Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\ndocumentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\nCovered Code.\n\n3.4.

If\nContributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\ngranted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\nmust include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\n\&quot;LEGAL\&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in\nsufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\nContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\navailable as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\nmodify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\nthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\nreceived the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n(b) Contributor APIs.  If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an\napplication programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of\npatent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\nContributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n \n(c) Representations.  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed\npursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that\nContributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s)\nand/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\nby this License.\n\n\n3.5.

If it is not possible to put such\nnotice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You\nmust include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\nwhere a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\ncreated one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\nduplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where\nYou describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to\nCovered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute Covered\nCode in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5\nhave been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice\nstating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\nunder the terms of this License, including a description of how and\nwhere You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice\nmust be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39;\nrights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the\nlicense for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\na different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\nInitial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify\nthe Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\nby the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\nterms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\nCode with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\nmust make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\nCovered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it.\n\n5.

No one other than Thomas Richter\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\nunder this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of\nthis License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which\nis not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\nrename Your license so that the phrases \&quot;TPL\&quot;, \&quot;THOR Software\&quot;,\n\&quot;Thomas Richter\&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this\nLicense) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the\nlicense contains terms which differ from the THOR Public\nLicense. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code\nor Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\nthemselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot;\nand \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot; as such terms are\nused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\nC.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\nall U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\nrights set forth herein.\n\n11.

If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\nGerman law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\nprovides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With\nrespect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an\nentity chartered or registered to do business in Federal Republic of\nGermany, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Federal Republic of\nGermany, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\nwithout limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and\nexpenses.

The Modifications which You create\n                  or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of\n                  this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.\n                  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed\n                  only under the terms of this License or a future version\n                  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\n                  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\n                  Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms\n                  on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\n                  applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights\n                  hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\n                  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You\n                  create or to which You contribute must be made available\n                  in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n                  either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n                  an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone\n                  to whom you made an Executable version available; and\n                  if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\n                  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n                  after the date it initially became available, or at\n                  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that\n                  particular Modification has been made available to such\n                  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the\n                  Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\n                  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered\n                  Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting\n                  the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n                  the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n                  statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n                  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\n                  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer\n                  in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n                  Executable version or related documentation in which You\n                  describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.4.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If\n                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n                  party&amp;apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections\n                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the\n                  Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the\n                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\n                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall\n                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\n                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include\n                  an application programming interface and Contributor\n                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably\n                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)\n                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as\n                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor\n                  believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s\n                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient\n                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\n                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible\n                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\n                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\n                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or\n                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source\n                  Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership\n                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,\n                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and\n                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\n                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\n                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\n                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if\n                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version\n                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n                  License, including a description of how and where You have\n                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must\n                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\n                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You\n                  describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.\n                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or\n                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You\n                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that\n                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n                  limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code\n                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n                  distribute the Executable version under a different license\n                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\n                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by\n                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining\n                  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of\n                  this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\n                  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n                  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the\n                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of the\n                  Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation\n                  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n                  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n                  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n                  be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and\n                  must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n                  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n                  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n                  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Application of this License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  This License applies to code to which the\n                  Initial Developer has attached the notice\n                  in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Versions of the License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  New Versions.

The Source Code version of\nCovered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and\nYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\nCode You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\nthis License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create\nor to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form\nunder the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to such recipients.

If You\ncreated one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\nduplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where\nYou describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to\nCovered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

The notice\nmust be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39;\nrights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the\nlicense for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\na different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\nInitial Developer or any Contributor.

Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\nCode with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\nmust make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\nCovered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code.

No one other than Thomas Richter\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\nunder this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of\nthis License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which\nis not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\nrename Your license so that the phrases \&quot;TPL\&quot;, \&quot;THOR Software\&quot;,\n\&quot;Thomas Richter\&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this\nLicense) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the\nlicense contains terms which differ from the THOR Public\nLicense. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code\nor Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\nthemselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot;\nand \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot; as such terms are\nused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\nC.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\nall U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\nrights set forth herein.\n\n11.

With\nrespect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an\nentity chartered or registered to do business in Federal Republic of\nGermany, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Federal Republic of\nGermany, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\nwithout limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and\nexpenses.

The Modifications which You create\n                  or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of\n                  this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.\n                  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed\n                  only under the terms of this License or a future version\n                  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\n                  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\n                  Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms\n                  on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\n                  applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights\n                  hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\n                  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You\n                  create or to which You contribute must be made available\n                  in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n                  either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n                  an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone\n                  to whom you made an Executable version available; and\n                  if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\n                  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n                  after the date it initially became available, or at\n                  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that\n                  particular Modification has been made available to such\n                  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the\n                  Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\n                  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered\n                  Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting\n                  the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n                  the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n                  statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n                  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\n                  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer\n                  in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n                  Executable version or related documentation in which You\n                  describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.4.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If\n                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n                  party&amp;apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections\n                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the\n                  Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the\n                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\n                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall\n                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\n                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include\n                  an application programming interface and Contributor\n                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably\n                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)\n                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as\n                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor\n                  believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s\n                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient\n                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\n                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible\n                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\n                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\n                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or\n                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source\n                  Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership\n                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,\n                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and\n                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\n                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\n                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\n                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if\n                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version\n                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n                  License, including a description of how and where You have\n                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must\n                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\n                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You\n                  describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.\n                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or\n                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You\n                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that\n                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n                  limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code\n                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n                  distribute the Executable version under a different license\n                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\n                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by\n                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining\n                  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of\n                  this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\n                  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n                  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the\n                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of the\n                  Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation\n                  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n                  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n                  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n                  be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and\n                  must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n                  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n                  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n                  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Application of this License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  This License applies to code to which the\n                  Initial Developer has attached the notice\n                  in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  Versions of the License.\n               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n&lt;li&gt;\n               &lt;var class=\&quot;replaceable-license-text\&quot;&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n                  New Versions.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL\&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Contributor APIs. If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;3.7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;5.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Application of this License.\n\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Versions of the License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.1.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   New Versions. Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Thomas Richter. No one other than Thomas Richter has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;6.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \&quot;TPL\&quot;, \&quot;THOR Software\&quot;, \&quot;Thomas Richter\&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the THOR Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;7.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.2.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that:\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(a)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;(b)\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.3.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;8.4.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;9.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;10.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot; and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n   &lt;&lt;var;name=\&quot;bullet\&quot;;original=\&quot;11.\&quot;;match=\&quot;.{0,20}\&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n   MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Application of License

ANY COVERED CODE THAT YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SECTION 2.2. THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF COVERED CODE MAY BE DISTRIBUTED ONLY UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE OR A FUTURE VERSION OF THIS LICENSE RELEASED UNDER SECTION 6.1, AND YOU MUST INCLUDE A COPY OF THIS LICENSE WITH EVERY COPY OF THE SOURCE CODE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE. YOU MAY NOT OFFER OR IMPOSE ANY TERMS ON ANY SOURCE CODE VERSION THAT ALTERS OR RESTRICTS THE APPLICABLE VERSION OF THIS LICENSE OR THE RECIPIENTS&#39; RIGHTS HEREUNDER. HOWEVER, YOU MAY INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL DOCUMENT OFFERING THE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code

ANY MODIFICATION WHICH YOU CREATE OR TO WHICH YOU CONTRIBUTE MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SOURCE CODE FORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE EITHER ON THE SAME MEDIA AS AN EXECUTABLE VERSION OR VIA AN ACCEPTED ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO ANYONE TO WHOM YOU MADE AN EXECUTABLE VERSION AVAILABLE; AND IF MADE AVAILABLE VIA ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM, MUST REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER THE DATE IT INITIALLY BECAME AVAILABLE, OR AT LEAST SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER A SUBSEQUENT VERSION OF THAT PARTICULAR MODIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO SUCH RECIPIENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE SOURCE CODE VERSION REMAINS AVAILABLE EVEN IF THE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM IS MAINTAINED BY A THIRD PARTY.

3.3. Description of Modifications

YOU MUST CAUSE ALL COVERED CODE TO WHICH YOU CONTRIBUTE TO CONTAIN A FILE DOCUMENTING THE CHANGES YOU MADE TO CREATE THAT COVERED CODE AND THE DATE OF ANY CHANGE. YOU MUST INCLUDE A PROMINENT STATEMENT THAT THE MODIFICATION IS DERIVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM ORIGINAL CODE PROVIDED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER IN (A) THE SOURCE CODE, AND (B) IN ANY NOTICE IN AN EXECUTABLE VERSION OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBE THE ORIGIN OR OWNERSHIP OF THE COVERED CODE.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims

IF CONTRIBUTOR HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT A LICENSE UNDER A THIRD PARTY&#39;S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS REQUIRED TO EXERCISE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY SUCH CONTRIBUTOR UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2, CONTRIBUTOR MUST INCLUDE A TEXT FILE WITH THE SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION TITLED &quot;LEGAL&quot; WHICH DESCRIBES THE CLAIM AND THE PARTY MAKING THE CLAIM IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL THAT A RECIPIENT WILL KNOW WHOM TO CONTACT. IF CONTRIBUTOR OBTAINS SUCH KNOWLEDGE AFTER THE MODIFICATION IS MADE AVAILABLE AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.2, CONTRIBUTOR SHALL PROMPTLY MODIFY THE LEGAL FILE IN ALL COPIES CONTRIBUTOR MAKES AVAILABLE THEREAFTER AND SHALL TAKE OTHER STEPS (SUCH AS NOTIFYING APPROPRIATE MAILING LISTS OR NEWSGROUPS) REASONABLY CALCULATED TO INFORM THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE COVERED CODE THAT NEW KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN OBTAINED.

(b) Contributor APIs

IF CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE AN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE AND CONTRIBUTOR HAS KNOWLEDGE OF PATENT LICENSES WHICH ARE REASONABLY NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THAT API, CONTRIBUTOR MUST ALSO INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION IN THE LEGAL FILE.

(c) Representations.

CONTRIBUTOR REPRESENTS THAT, EXCEPT AS DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.4 (A) ABOVE, CONTRIBUTOR BELIEVES THAT CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S MODIFICATIONS ARE CONTRIBUTOR&#39;S ORIGINAL CREATION(S) AND/OR CONTRIBUTOR HAS SUFFICIENT RIGHTS TO GRANT THE RIGHTS CONVEYED BY THIS LICENSE.

3.5. Required Notices

YOU MUST DUPLICATE THE NOTICE IN EXHIBIT A IN EACH FILE OF THE SOURCE CODE. IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PUT SUCH NOTICE IN A PARTICULAR SOURCE CODE FILE DUE TO ITS STRUCTURE, THEN YOU MUST INCLUDE SUCH NOTICE IN A LOCATION (SUCH AS A RELEVANT DIRECTORY) WHERE A USER WOULD BE LIKELY TO LOOK FOR SUCH A NOTICE. IF YOU CREATED ONE OR MORE MODIFICATION(S) YOU MAY ADD YOUR NAME AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A. YOU MUST ALSO DUPLICATE THIS LICENSE IN ANY DOCUMENTATION FOR THE SOURCE CODE WHERE YOU DESCRIBE RECIPIENTS&#39; RIGHTS OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS RELATING TO COVERED CODE. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO OFFER, AND TO CHARGE A FEE FOR, WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO ONE OR MORE RECIPIENTS OF COVERED CODE. HOWEVER, YOU MAY DO SO ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. YOU MUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAN ANY SUCH WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATION IS OFFERED BY YOU ALONE, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EVERY CONTRIBUTOR FOR ANY LIABILITY INCURRED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR AS A RESULT OF WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY TERMS YOU OFFER.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions

YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE COVERED CODE IN EXECUTABLE FORM ONLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 AND 3.5 HAVE BEEN MET FOR THAT COVERED CODE, AND IF YOU INCLUDE A NOTICE STATING THAT THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF THE COVERED CODE IS AVAILABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF HOW AND WHERE YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.2. THE NOTICE MUST BE CONSPICUOUSLY INCLUDED IN ANY NOTICE IN AN EXECUTABLE VERSION, RELATED DOCUMENTATION OR COLLATERAL IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBE RECIPIENTS&#39; RIGHTS RELATING TO THE COVERED CODE. YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE EXECUTABLE VERSION OF COVERED CODE OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS UNDER A LICENSE OF YOUR CHOICE, WHICH MAY CONTAIN TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THIS LICENSE, PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND THAT THE LICENSE FOR THE EXECUTABLE VERSION DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO LIMIT OR ALTER THE RECIPIENT&#39;S RIGHTS IN THE SOURCE CODE VERSION FROM THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE EXECUTABLE VERSION UNDER A DIFFERENT LICENSE YOU MUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ANY TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THIS LICENSE ARE OFFERED BY YOU ALONE, NOT BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EVERY CONTRIBUTOR FOR ANY LIABILITY INCURRED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH TERMS YOU OFFER.

3.7. Larger Works

YOU MAY CREATE A LARGER WORK BY COMBINING COVERED CODE WITH OTHER CODE NOT GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE LARGER WORK AS A SINGLE PRODUCT. IN SUCH A CASE, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LICENSE ARE FULFILLED FOR THE COVERED CODE.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE WITH RESPECT TO SOME OR ALL OF THE COVERED CODE DUE TO STATUTE, JUDICIAL ORDER, OR REGULATION THEN YOU MUST: (A) COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE; AND (B) DESCRIBE THE LIMITATIONS AND THE CODE THEY AFFECT. SUCH DESCRIPTION MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE LEGAL FILE DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.4 AND MUST BE INCLUDED WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOURCE CODE. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY STATUTE OR REGULATION, SUCH DESCRIPTION MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED FOR A RECIPIENT OF ORDINARY SKILL TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT.

5. Application of this License

THIS LICENSE APPLIES TO CODE TO WHICH THE INITIAL DEVELOPER HAS ATTACHED THE NOTICE IN EXHIBIT A AND TO RELATED COVERED CODE.

6. Versions of the License

6.1. New Versions

TERRACOTTA, INC. (&quot;TERRACOTTA&quot;) MAY PUBLISH REVISED AND/OR NEW VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE FROM TIME TO TIME. EACH VERSION WILL BE GIVEN A DISTINGUISHING VERSION NUMBER.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

ONCE COVERED CODE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED UNDER A PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE LICENSE, YOU MAY ALWAYS CONTINUE TO USE IT UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT VERSION. YOU MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO USE SUCH COVERED CODE UNDER THE TERMS OF ANY SUBSEQUENT VERSION OF THE LICENSE PUBLISHED BY TERRACOTTA. NO ONE OTHER THAN TERRACOTTA HAS THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE TERMS APPLICABLE TO COVERED CODE CREATED UNDER THIS LICENSE.

6.3. Derivative Works of License; Antecedent Licenses

IF YOU CREATE OR USE A MODIFIED VERSION OF THIS LICENSE (WHICH YOU MAY ONLY DO IN ORDER TO APPLY IT TO CODE WHICH IS NOT ALREADY COVERED CODE GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE), YOU MUST (A) RENAME YOUR LICENSE SO THAT THE PHRASES &quot;TERRACOTTA&quot;, &quot;TPL&quot;, OR ANY CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR PHRASE DO NOT APPEAR IN YOUR LICENSE (EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT YOUR LICENSE DIFFERS FROM THIS LICENSE) AND (B) OTHERWISE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOUR VERSION OF THE LICENSE CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THE TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE. (FILLING IN THE NAME OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL CODE OR CONTRIBUTOR IN THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A SHALL NOT OF THEMSELVES BE DEEMED TO BE MODIFICATIONS OF THIS LICENSE.)

THIS TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE (TPL) IS SIMILAR TO, AND CONTAINS SAMPLES FROM, THE MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE (MPL) AND THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL). HOWEVER, THIS TPL CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN THE MPL AND THE CDDL.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. Termination

8.1. THIS LICENSE AND THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER WILL TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH TERMS HEREIN AND FAIL TO CURE SUCH BREACH WITHIN 30 DAYS OF BECOMING AWARE OF THE BREACH. ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.

8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS &quot;PARTICIPANT&quot;) ALLEGING THAT:

a. such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT&#39;S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. Termination\n\n8.1. THIS LICENSE AND THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER WILL TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH TERMS HEREIN AND FAIL TO CURE SUCH BREACH WITHIN 30 DAYS OF BECOMING AWARE OF THE BREACH. ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.\n\n8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS \&quot;PARTICIPANT\&quot;) ALLEGING THAT:\n\na. such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\nb. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT&#39;S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.\n\n8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.\n\n9. Limitation of Liability\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. Government End Users\n\nTHE COVERED CODE IS A \&quot;COMMERCIAL ITEM,\&quot; AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (OCT. 1995), CONSISTING OF \&quot;COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE\&quot; AND \&quot;COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION,\&quot; AS SUCH TERMS ARE USED IN 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (SEPT. 1995). CONSISTENT WITH 48 C.F.R. 12.212 AND 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 THROUGH 227.7202-4 (JUNE 1995), ALL U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS ACQUIRE COVERED CODE WITH ONLY THOSE RIGHTS SET FORTH HEREIN.\n\n11. Miscellaneous\n\nTHIS LICENSE REPRESENTS THE COMPLETE AGREEMENT CONCERNING SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE IS HELD TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, SUCH PROVISION SHALL BE REFORMED ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO MAKE IT ENFORCEABLE. THIS LICENSE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW PROVISIONS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, PROVIDES OTHERWISE), EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICT-OF-LAW PROVISIONS. WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE PARTY IS A CITIZEN OF, OR AN ENTITY CHARTERED OR REGISTERED TO DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ANY LITIGATION RELATING TO THIS LICENSE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WITH VENUE LYING IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WITH THE LOSING PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS&#39; FEES AND EXPENSES.

NO ONE OTHER THAN TERRACOTTA HAS THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE TERMS APPLICABLE TO COVERED CODE CREATED UNDER THIS LICENSE.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works of License; Antecedent Licenses\n\nIF YOU CREATE OR USE A MODIFIED VERSION OF THIS LICENSE (WHICH YOU MAY ONLY DO IN ORDER TO APPLY IT TO CODE WHICH IS NOT ALREADY COVERED CODE GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE), YOU MUST (A) RENAME YOUR LICENSE SO THAT THE PHRASES \&quot;TERRACOTTA\&quot;, \&quot;TPL\&quot;, OR ANY CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR PHRASE DO NOT APPEAR IN YOUR LICENSE (EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT YOUR LICENSE DIFFERS FROM THIS LICENSE) AND (B) OTHERWISE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOUR VERSION OF THE LICENSE CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THE TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE. (FILLING IN THE NAME OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL CODE OR CONTRIBUTOR IN THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A SHALL NOT OF THEMSELVES BE DEEMED TO BE MODIFICATIONS OF THIS LICENSE.)\n\nTHIS TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE (TPL) IS SIMILAR TO, AND CONTAINS SAMPLES FROM, THE MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE (MPL) AND THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL).

SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. Termination\n\n8.1.

PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.\n\n8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS \&quot;PARTICIPANT\&quot;) ALLEGING THAT:\n\na. such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\nb. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT&#39;S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.\n\n8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.\n\n9. Limitation of Liability\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. Government End Users\n\nTHE COVERED CODE IS A \&quot;COMMERCIAL ITEM,\&quot; AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (OCT. 1995), CONSISTING OF \&quot;COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE\&quot; AND \&quot;COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION,\&quot; AS SUCH TERMS ARE USED IN 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (SEPT. 1995).
