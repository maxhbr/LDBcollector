The yaml files withing the subfolders shows metadata on the individual licenses and exception.
The files also contain alternative names that support the normalization of licenses and exceptions.

## Why another list of licenses and exceptions?
{metæffekt} is follows a defined strategie for analyzing, scanning and documenting software projects. To do this a 
consistent baseline set of information is required. This baseline must cover the different license types that a used
by the software stacks being examined.

OSI, SPDX and ScanCode provide a good representation of licenses and exceptions in the open source
domain. However, the license identification and matching strategies are not fully compatible with
the level of granularity and paradigms set forth by {metæffekt}. Second, the data does not cover public 
available licenses (at least not to the extend required).

This is why {metæffekt} chose to create an overarching database of licenses, exceptions, 
references, exceptions, expressions; the {metæffekt}-universe.

## Is {metæffekt} handing back to the FOSS Compliance Community?
Sure. We intent to provide those parts of our {metæffekt}-universe into the community, which we are allowed to.

The only issue is time and resources. {metæffekt} is a self financed company that makes a
living from customer projects. With our limited time and resources we have to be very focused. 
We are ready to do community work, once we see that there is a benefit beyond simply publishing 
materials.

So, if you see that this materials can be suitable to you or easy your work, let us known. We are looking forward to
intensify our community work or to start off a new project.

## Disclaimer

This is all work in progress. In particular the scancode identifications and scancode matching is used
to validate the dataset.

Please note, that the {metæffekt}-universe as displayed in this repository is a converted, reduced
dataset from the representation we use internally. The internal representation models licenses
explicitly. We perform deterministic license matching based on evidences and patterns.

The internal representation (and therefore the content shown here) is based on SPDX and ScanCode.

All company names, organization names, license names, and product names mentioned in this documentation
are used for identification purposes only.

## Contribution
As this repository is largely showing converted data a direct contribution in the form of patches is
not appropriate. You may send requests for corrections or questions 
to [contact@metaeffekt.com](mailto:contact@metaeffekt.com). Modifications will then be applied to the 
internal dataset to produce the corrected outputs.
