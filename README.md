# OSI-License-Categories
Part of a project to put more rigor to understanding the OSI license list and the relationships between the approved licenses

Initially launched at the Free Software Foundation Europe's (FSFE) Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) in Gothenberg, Sweden in 2024.

Aim here is to analyze the OSI approved license list (found here: https://opensource.org/license) to determine where licenses have common text, and also where, despite common text, they deviate from one another.

THe hope here is that it might help people navigate the full license list, as well as understand that many of the licenses are variants (sometimes relatively insubstantial variants) from one another.

The .odt files are comparison files between OSI-approved licenses and a "ur" analogue license that I've designated as the "head of license family." By opening those files, you can see how the particular license compares to the "ur" license. In some cases (concatenative) there's a comparison to multiple licenses because a particular license takes parts from more than one license.
