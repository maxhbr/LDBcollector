# lice-comb

A Clojure library for software *lice*nse detection.  It does this by *comb*ing through tools.deps and Leiningen dependencies, directory structures, and JAR & ZIP files, attempting to detect what license(s) they contain, and then normalising them into [SPDX license expression(s)](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/).

This library leverages, and is inspired by, the *excellent* [SPDX project](https://spdx.dev/).  It's a great shame that it doesn't have greater traction in the Java & Clojure (and wider open source) communities.  If you're new to SPDX and would prefer to read a primer rather than dry specification documents, I can thoroughly recommend [David A. Wheeler's SPDX Tutorial](https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/spdx-tutorial#spdx-tutorial).

## Disclaimer

**The author and contributors to `lice-comb` are not lawyers, and neither they nor `lice-comb` itself provides legal advice. This is nothing more than logic to assist in finding license information.**

## System Requirements

* `lice-comb` (all versions) requires an internet connection.

* `lice-comb` (all versions) assumes Maven is installed and in the `PATH` (but has fallback logic if it isn't available).

* `lice-comb` (v2.0+) requires JDK 11 or higher.

## Installation

`lice-comb` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.github.pmonks/lice-comb).

### Trying it Out

#### Clojure CLI

```shell
$ # Where #.#.# is replaced with an actual version number (see badge above)
$ clj -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.pmonks/lice-comb {:mvn/version "#.#.#"}}}'
```

#### Leiningen

```shell
$ lein try com.github.pmonks/lice-comb
```

#### deps-try

```shell
$ deps-try com.github.pmonks/lice-comb
```

### Demo

```clojure
;; Core matching functionality
(require '[lice-comb.matching :as lcm])

; Initialise the matching namespace
; Notes:
; 1. This is slow the first time it's run, due to Spdx-Java-Library downloading SPDX files from the
;    internet and caching them (it takes ~1 minute on my laptop). It's substantially faster on
;    subsequent invocations however.
; 2. This step is optional, though initialisation will still happen regardless, and when it does
;    you'll incur the same cost
(lcm/init!)

(lcm/name->expressions "Apache")
;=> #{"Apache-2.0"}

(lcm/name->expressions "GNU Public License 2.0 w/ the GNU Classpath Exception")

;=> #{"Apache-2.0"}


;; License extraction from Maven poms, including ones that aren't locally downloaded
(require '[lice-comb.maven :as lcmvn])

(require '[lice-comb.deps :as lcd])

(lcd/dep->expressions ['org.clojure/clojure {:deps/manifest :mvn :mvn/version "1.11.1"}])

;; License extraction from Leiningen dependency vectors

(lcl/dep->expressions ['aopalliance/aopalliance "1.0"])

; Also shows how lice-comb handles "public domain" attestations (which are not supported directly
; by SPDX, as they're not a licensing mechanism)

## Upgrading

### 1.x -> 2.x

The implementation of [issue #3](https://github.com/pmonks/lice-comb/issues/3) resulted in a number of unavoidable breaking changes, including:

* A wholesale change from returning sets of SPDX identifiers to returning sets of SPDX expressions
* The creation of [a dedicated SPDX-specific library (`clj-spdx`)](https://github.com/pmonks/clj-spdx) that leverages [the official SPDX Java library](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library)

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with the caveat that the permanent branches are called `main` and `dev`, and any changes to the `main` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed (JARs to Clojars, API docs to GitHub Pages, etc.).

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `main` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `main` will be rejected.

### Build Tasks

`lice-comb` uses [`tools.build`](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build). You can get a list of available tasks by running:

```
clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc
```

Of particular interest are:

* `clojure -T:build test` - run the unit tests
* `clojure -T:build lint` - run the linters (clj-kondo and eastwood)
* `clojure -T:build ci` - run the full CI suite (check for outdated dependencies, run the unit tests, run the linters)
* `clojure -T:build install` - build the JAR and install it locally (e.g. so you can test it with downstream code)

Please note that the `deploy` task is restricted to the core development team (and will not function if you run it yourself).
