# Double Open Policy Configuration

This repository is used to maintain the license classification (license-classifications.yml) created by Double Open.

## Rationale

We aim to maintain the license classification consumed by [ORT (OSS Review Toolkit)](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) in automatic open source compliance reviews. However, the contents of the license classification file are useful in many manual instances too, at least for us. Anyone is free to use the license classification subject to its applicable licensing. As you can see, the license classification is published by us freely, without any warranties.

## ORT rules

We do not currently maintain our ORT rules as a public version. However, we have published a small ruleset to help in combining the license classification with your ORT rules.

## Versioning

We are currently in beta versions, below 1.0. Our aim with versioning is to enable the determination of compatibility between different versions of related resources. For example version 0.9 of the license classification will work together with certain ORT rules. We also offer training and policy documentation which may need to be updated as versions update. The version numbering helps us to communicate which documents have been created to work together. Backward compatibility is still being explored as to, e.g., what extent we can update the license classifications while maintaining backward compatibility with the ORT rules.

## Contributing to the license classification

Unclassified or unchecked licenses and new license variants - as well as some new licenses - are identified in new compliance projects. Also, there could be room for discussion or plain errors in the current classification. Changes to the license classification can be proposed via pull request or with GitHub issues. We expect all new content to be published in our repository under CC0, as this is how we have published our own work so far. Submitting new or changed material, whether with pull requests or GitHub issues, indicates that you accept the application of CC0 to your submission.

## Paid services

If you need a warranty for the content of the classification, or for the timely maintenance of the classification for new modifications, please be in contact with us.
