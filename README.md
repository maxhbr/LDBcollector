The yaml files within the subfolders show metadata on the individual licenses and exceptions.
The files also contain alternative names that support the normalization of licenses and exceptions.

## Why another list of licenses and exceptions?
{metæffekt} follows a defined strategy for analyzing, scanning and documenting software projects. To do this, a 
consistent information/data baseline is required. This baseline must cover the different license types that are used
by the software stacks being examined.

OSI, SPDX and the ScanCode Toolkit provide a good representation of licenses and exceptions in the FOSS domain. 
However, the license identification and matching strategies are not fully compatible with
the level of granularity and paradigms set forth by {metæffekt}. Second, the data does not cover publicly
available commercial licenses (at least not to the extend required).

This is why {metæffekt} choose to create an overarching database of licenses, exceptions, 
references, exceptions, expressions; the {metæffekt}-universe.

## Is {metæffekt} handing back to the FOSS Compliance Community?
Sure. We intend to provide those parts of our {metæffekt}-universe to the community, which we are allowed to share.

The only issue is time and resources. {metæffekt} is a self-financed company that makes a
living from customer projects. With our limited time and resources we have to be very focused. 
We are ready to do community work, once we see that there is a benefit beyond simply publishing 
materials.

So if you see that this material can be useful to you or ease your work, let us know. We are looking forward to
intensify our community work or to start off a new project.

## Disclaimer

This is all work in progress and subject to continuous improvement. In particular, ScanCode identifications and
ScanCode matching is used to validate the dataset and synchronize the different sources.

Please note that the {metæffekt}-universe as displayed in this repository is a converted, reduced
dataset from a more extensive internal representation. The internal representation models licenses
explicitly and is used for deterministic license matching based on evidences and patterns.

The internal representation (and therefore the content shown here) is based on SPDX and ScanCode.

All company names, organization names, license names, and product names mentioned in this documentation
are used for identification purposes only.

## Contribution
As this repository is largely showing converted data a direct contribution in the form of patches is
not appropriate. You may send requests for corrections or questions 
to [contact@metaeffekt.com](mailto:contact@metaeffekt.com). Modifications will then be applied to the 
internal dataset to produce the corrected outputs.
