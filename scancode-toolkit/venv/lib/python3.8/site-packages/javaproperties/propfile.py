class PropertiesFile(MutableMapping[str, str]):
    """
    .. versionadded:: 0.3.0

    A custom mapping class for reading from, editing, and writing to a
    ``.properties`` file while preserving comments & whitespace in the original
    input.

    A `PropertiesFile` instance can be constructed from another mapping and/or
    iterable of pairs, after which it will act like an
    `~collections.OrderedDict`.  Alternatively, an instance can be constructed
    from a file or string with `PropertiesFile.load()` or
    `PropertiesFile.loads()`, and the resulting instance will remember the
    formatting of its input and retain that formatting when written back to a
    file or string with the `~PropertiesFile.dump()` or
    `~PropertiesFile.dumps()` method.  The formatting information attached to
    an instance ``pf`` can be forgotten by constructing another mapping from it
    via ``dict(pf)``, ``OrderedDict(pf)``, or even ``PropertiesFile(pf)`` (Use
    the `copy()` method if you want to create another `PropertiesFile` instance
    with the same data & formatting).

    When not reading or writing, `PropertiesFile` behaves like a normal
    `~collections.abc.MutableMapping` class (i.e., you can do ``props[key] =
    value`` and so forth), except that (a) like `~collections.OrderedDict`, key
    insertion order is remembered and is used when iterating & dumping (and
    `reversed` is supported), and (b) like `Properties`, it may only be used to
    store strings and will raise a `TypeError` if passed a non-string object as
    key or value.

    Two `PropertiesFile` instances compare equal iff both their key-value pairs
    and comment & whitespace lines are equal and in the same order.  When
    comparing a `PropertiesFile` to any other type of mapping, only the
    key-value pairs are considered, and order is ignored.

    `PropertiesFile` currently only supports reading & writing the simple
    line-oriented format, not XML.
