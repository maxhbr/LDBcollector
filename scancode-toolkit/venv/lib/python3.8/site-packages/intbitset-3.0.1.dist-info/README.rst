Installation
============

intbitset is on PyPI so all you need is a C compiler and pip: ::

    pip install intbitset

Documentation
=============

The ``intbitset`` library provides a set implementation to store sorted
unsigned integers either 32-bits integers (between ``0`` and
``2**31 - 1`` or ``intbitset.__maxelem__``) or an infinite range
with fast set operations implemented via bit vectors in a *Python C
extension* for speed and reduced memory usage.

The ``inbitset`` class emulates the Python built-in set class interface
with some additional specific methods such as its own fast dump and load
marshalling functions.  ::

    >>> from intbitset import intbitset
    >>> x = intbitset([1,2,3])
    >>> y = intbitset([3,4,5])
    >>> x & y
    intbitset([3])
    >>> x | y
    intbitset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

``intbitset`` additionally support the `pickle protocol
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_, the `iterator protocol
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types>`_ and can
behave like a ``sequence`` that can be sliced. Because the intergers are
always stored sorted, the fist element of a non-empty set `[0]` is also
the `min()` integer and the last element `[-1]` is also the `max()` integer
in the set.

When compared to the standard library ``set`` class, ``intbitset`` set
operations such as intersection, union and difference can be up to 5000
faster for dense integer sets.

Complete documentation is available at <http://intbitset.readthedocs.io> or
can be built using Sphinx: ::

    pip install Sphinx
    python setup.py build_sphinx

Testing
=======

Running the tests are as simple as: ::

    pip install -e .[tests]
    pytest

Running the tests on multiple Python versions: ::

    pip install tox
    tox


Development
===========

To regenerate the C code with Cython: ::

    pip install cython
    cython intbitset/intbitset.pyx

Then commit the regenarted C source and update the CHANGE.rst
