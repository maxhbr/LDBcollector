* Export the Google spreadsheet to a TSV file (not CSV)

* Run the script this way:

      ./tsv2toml.py good.tsv $(pwd)/approved

  The good.tsv file is the exported spreadsheet from Google with the
  column header row removed and any summary total rows below the
  license rows removed.  The second argument to the script is the
  subdirectory to store the licenses.  Right now we're only writing
  out approved licenses.

* The script will display which rows caused problems and save the bad
  rows to "bad.tsv" which can be imported in to another Google
  spreadsheet if you want.

Ideally we will just remedy the problem rows and run this script again
until everything is imported.  At that point the spreadsheet can be
discarded and all continuing work will be in the git repo.  Of course,
the work for unapproved licenses and special case things can be
handled before we completely discard the spreadsheet side of the
information.
