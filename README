Fedora License Data Project

This project contains information about licenses used in the Fedora
Linux project.  Licenses are categorized by their approval or
non-approval and may include additional notes.  The data files provide
mappings between the SDPX license expressions and the older Fedora
license abbreviations.

The project also intends to publish the combined license information
in a number of data file formats and provide a package in Fedora for
other projects to reference, such as package building tools and
package checking tools.

The Fedora Legal is responsible for this project.
