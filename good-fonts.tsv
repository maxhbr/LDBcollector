Even with this change, this license is considered to be on the "borderline" of Free, and it is not recommended for use.

Hack Open Font License	HOFL	LicenseRef-HOFL	NO	not found currently in Fedora	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/HackOpenFontLicense	The Hack Open Font License is a weird mix of the Bitstream Vera and SIL Open Font licenses. It has the common "must be renamed if modified" and "must not be sold by itself" clauses that are found in font licenses. These clauses might make a software license non-free (though, the first one seems to be acceptable by the FSF in some cases), but they have been considered acceptable for FOSS font licensing for some time now. It is worth noting that the Hack font upstream (the origination of this license) feels that the "sold by itself" clause can be trivially circumvented and has no issue with people doing that (e.g. font comes with a helloworld binary).
