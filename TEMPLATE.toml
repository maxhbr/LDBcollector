# Each file provides information about a single allowed or not-allowed
# Fedora license.  The file format is TOML and the sections are
# described below.  For information on the TOML standard, see

# All files must provide a 'license' block.
[license]

# The SPDX expression for this license type in Fedora.
#
#     spdx_expression = "GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Autoconf-exception-3.0"
#
# This expression is constructed using valid SPDX license and
# exception identifiers found at https://spdx.org/ and information
# on how to contruct SPDX expressions at https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/SPDX-license-expressions/
# Note: the SPDX expressions operators OR and AND should not be used 
# in this context. 
#
# This is a required field.
expression = ""

# The status identifiers for this license expression.  It is an array
# of strings where each string may be any of:
#
#     allowed
#     allowed-content
#     allowed-documentation
#     allowed-fonts
#     allowed-firmware
#     not-allowed
#
# This is a required field.  At least one status is required, but a license
# may have multiple listed for specific "allowed" scenarios 
# (e.g., "allowed-content" and "allowed-documentation").  Note that 
# "not-allowed" should not be combined with any allowed statuses and "allowed"
# need not be combined with any other allowed statuses. For more information 
# on how Fedora determines the status of a license, 
# see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-approval
status = [ "" ]

# Optional URL(s) to the license text.  This field is a multiline
# literal string.  For licenses that have an SPDX expression, 
# the the corresponding SPDX URL will be auto-generated when the Docs packages
# displaying this data is published, so you do not need to put SPDX URLs here. 
# For example:
#
#     url = '''
#     https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html
#     https://www.gnu.org/licenses/autoconf-exception-3.0.html

# This field is optional.

# Any notes related to specific usage for a particular license. For example,

# This field is optional.

# Full text of the license for licenses that do not have an SPDX
# expression.  This field is a multiline
