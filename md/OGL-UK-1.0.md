    legislation (including the Freedom of Information Acts for the UK and Scotland) by

    Definitions
    In this licence, the terms below have the following meanings:

    ‘Information’

    and artistic works, content, data and source code) offered for use under the terms of this licence.

    ‘Information Provider’
    means the person or organisation providing the Information under this licence.

    ‘Licensor’
    means any Information Provider which has the authority to offer Information under the
    terms of this licence or the Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, who has the

    means the natural or legal person, or body of persons corporate or incorporate, acquiring rights under this licence.

    About the Open Government Licence
    The Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) has developed this licence as a
    tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use
    of their Information under a common open licence. The Controller invites public sector
    bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence.

    The Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and
    database right owned by the Crown. The extent of the Controller’s offer to license this
    Information under the terms of this licence is set out in the UK Government Licensing Framework.

    This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from
    time to time, issue new versions of the Open Government Licence. However, you may continue
    to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so.

    These terms have been aligned to be interoperable with any Creative Commons Attribution Licence,
    which covers copyright, and Open Data Commons Attribution License, which covers database rights and applicable copyrights.
