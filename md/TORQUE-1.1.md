General Comments
----------------

-   “Per Fedora, when the licensing for TORQUE 2.4 expired, the TORQUE
    upstream drafted a new license with updated contact information. The
    intention was to have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the
    older licensing, but because part of it was misread or accidentally
    ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE v2.5+ Software License contained
    commercial use restrictions which made it non-free. After this issue
    was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the TORQUE upstream revised
    the license to remove the commercial use restrictions in v1.1. The
    TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but GPL incompatible
    because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that this
    license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is
    derived from OpenPBS''s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is
    properly dual licensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that
    this license is not useful for other codebases without removing Note
    1. ” (source:
