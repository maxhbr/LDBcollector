    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    PREAMBLE
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
    framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
    others.

    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
    redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font
    names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

    DEFINITIONS
    "Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:
        - font files
        - data files
        - source code
        - build scripts
        - documentation

    "Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by
    users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

    "Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
    components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by
    adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole --
    any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats
    or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
    Software, subject to the following conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
    in Standard or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

    2) Standard or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and sold with any software, provided that each copy
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
    Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is
    granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all 
    references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and
    other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the
    font from others.

    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
    Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
    permission.

    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed using this license, and may not be distributed
    under any other license.

    TERMINATION
    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
    not met.

    DISCLAIMER
    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
