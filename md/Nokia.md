    a) which is directly or indirectly controlling such party;

    b) which is under the same direct or indirect ownership or control as such party; or

    c) which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party.

    other entity has fifty percent (50%) or more of the votes in such entity, is able to
    direct its affairs and/or to control the composition of its board of directors or
    equivalent body.

    "Commercial Use" shall mean distribution or otherwise making the Covered Software
    available to a third party.

    ''Contributor'' shall mean each entity that creates or contributes to the creation of
    Modifications.

    ''Contributor Version'' shall mean in case of any Contributor the combination of the
    Original Software, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications
    made by that particular Contributor and in case of Nokia in addition the Original
    Software in any form, including the form as Exceutable.

    ''Covered Software'' shall mean the Original Software or Modifications or the
    combination of the Original Software and Modifications, in each case including
    portions thereof.

    ''Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' shall mean a mechanism generally accepted in

    thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

    ''License'' shall mean this document.

    "Licensable" shall mean having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible,
    whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently acquired, any and all of the
    rights conveyed herein.

    ''Modifications'' shall mean any addition to or deletion from the substance or
    structure of either the Original Software or any previous Modifications. When Covered
    Software is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

    a) Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Original
    Software or previous Modifications.

    b) Any new file that contains any part of the Original Software or previous
    Modifications.

    ''Original Software'' shall mean the Source Code of computer software code which is

    modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an
    Executable, or source code differential comparisons against either the Original
    Software or another well known, available Covered Software of the Contributor's
    choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
    appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

    "You'' (or "Your") shall mean an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of

    Subject to the terms of this License and subject to third party intellectual property
    claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license

    a) under copyrights Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display,
    perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
    portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
    Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    b) under Patent Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using, or selling of
    Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its

    with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or
    4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications
    made by that Contributor.

    3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

    3.1 Application of License.


    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
    terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
    version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License
    or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include
    a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
    offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
    applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
    may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
    Section 3.5.

    3.2 Availability of Source Code.

    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available
    in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
    Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to
    whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
    the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients.
    You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
    if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    3.3 Description of Modifications.

    You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
    documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any
    change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
    directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the
    name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
    or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
    Software.

    3.4  Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims.

    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
    property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under
    Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
    distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim
    in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
    obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
    Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
    received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs.

    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
    Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
    implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

    (c) Representations.

    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
    Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
    creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
    this License.

    3.5 Required Notices.

    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
    not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
    structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
    directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one
    or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
    described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for
    the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
    Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia
    or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
    agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
    offer.

    3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of
    Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice
    stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the
    terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
    the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
    notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
    describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the
    Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your
    choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
    version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
    version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
    version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer.

    3.7 Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
    product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
    fulfilled for the Covered Software.

    4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
    extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
    description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
    included with all distributions of the Source Code.

    Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

    5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

    This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and
    to related Covered Software.

    6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.


    6.1 New Versions.

    Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
    version will be given a distinguishing version number.

    6.2 Effect of New Versions.

    Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License,
    You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
    choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
    License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms
    applicable to Covered Software created under this License.

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
    DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

    8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You
    fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
    becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are
    properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
    survive.

    8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor
    against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

    a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
    patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1
    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
    in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
    and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
    within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
    mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
    withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
    automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
    above.

    b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
    Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
    by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
    date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
    Participant.

    8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
    Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
    such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
    patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by
    such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
    the amount or value of any payment or license.

    8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
    agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
    You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
    DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
    COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A
    PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S.
    $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any
    party dealing as a consumer.

    10. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All
    rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.
    Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of
    Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any
    part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

    This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled
    by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The
    arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language.
    If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the
    validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable
    according to its terms.

    11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
    damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
    License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
    to constitute any admission of liability.

INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\nrespect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or\nregulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum\nextent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
