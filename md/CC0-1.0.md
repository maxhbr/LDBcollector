    Creative Commons Legal Code

    CC0 1.0 Universal

        CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
        LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
        ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
        INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
        REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
        PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
        THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
        HEREUNDER.

    Statement of Purpose

    The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
    and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
    authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
    the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
    scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
    of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
    works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
    and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
    These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
    culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
    works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
    part through the use and efforts of others.

    For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
    expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
    associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
    is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
    elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
    terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

    1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
    Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
    limited to, the following:

      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
         communicate, and translate a Work;
     ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
         likeness depicted in a Work;
     iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
         subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
         in a Work;
     vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
         European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
         protection of databases, and under any national implementation
         thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
         directive); and
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
         world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
         implementations thereof.

    2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
    of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
    irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
    Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
    of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
    future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
    worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
    treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
    purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
    member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
    successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
    revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
    equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
    as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

    3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
    be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
    Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
    extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
    person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
    time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
    of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
    limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
    "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
    applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
    partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
    of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
    will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
    Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
    action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
    express Statement of Purpose.

    4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

     a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
        surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
     b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
        warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
        statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
        title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
        infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
        the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
        the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
     c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
        that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
        limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
        Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
        consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
        Work.
     d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
        party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
        this CC0 or use of the Work.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. \n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n    i.the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n\n    ii.moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n    iii.publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n\n    iv.rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n    v.rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n\n    vi.database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 \n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor \n    version of such directive); and\n\n    vii.other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national \n    implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. \n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n    a.No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by \n    this document.\n\n    b.Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, \n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, \n    non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not \n    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n    c.Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, \n    including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility \n    for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n    d.Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation \n    with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.",
