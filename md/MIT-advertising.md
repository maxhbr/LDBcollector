-   “Per Fedora, this license is a modified version of the common MIT
    license, with an additional advertising clause that makes it
    GPL-incompatible. It was originally found at
    http://www.enlightenment.org/viewvc/e16/e/COPYING?revision=1.10 ,
    but that URL is gone (they seem to have moved source control
    systems). The latest available copy from enlightment.org
    http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk/E16/e/COPYING has been
    preserved here for reference. ” (source:
