    2. Source Code License.

          2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
          The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
          non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
          claims:
               (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
               trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
               modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
               Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
               as part of a Larger Work; and

               (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
               selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
               sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
               Original Code (or portions thereof).

               (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
               effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
               Original Code under the terms of this License.

               (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
               granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
               separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
               by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
               combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

          2.2. Contributor Grant.
          Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
          hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

               (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
               trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
               display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
               created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
               unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
               and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

               (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
               selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
               and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
               of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
               made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
               Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
               Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
               Version (or portions of such combination).

               (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
               effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
               the Covered Code.

               (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
               granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
               Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
               3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
               Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
               by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
               Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
               infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
               that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

          3.1. Application of License.
          The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
          governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
          Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
          distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
          of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
          copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
          distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
          version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
          License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
          an additional document offering the additional rights described in
          Section 3.5.

          3.2. Availability of Source Code.
          Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
          made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
          either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
          Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
          Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
          Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
          months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
          (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
          has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
          ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
          Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

          3.3. Description of Modifications.
          You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
          file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
          the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
          the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
          Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
          Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
          Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
          origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

          3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
               (a) Third Party Claims.
               If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
               intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
               granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
               Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
               distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
               party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
               know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
               the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
               Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
               Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
               (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
               reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
               Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

               (b) Contributor APIs.
               If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
               interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
               are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
               also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                    (c)    Representations.
               Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
               Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
               Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
               Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
               this License.

          3.5. Required Notices.
          You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
          Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
          Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
          location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
          to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
          You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
          Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
          for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
          rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
          charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
          obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
          may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
          Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
          any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
          offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
          Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
          Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
          support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

          3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
          You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
          requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
          and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
          the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
          including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
          obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
          in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
          collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
          Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
          Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
          contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
          compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
          Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
          rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
          License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
          license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
          from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
          Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
          Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
          the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
          terms You offer.

          3.7. Larger Works.
          You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
          not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
          Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
          requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

          If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
          License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
          statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
          the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
          describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
          must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
          be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
          extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
          sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
          understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

          This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
          attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

          6.1. New Versions.
          Netizen Pty Ltd ("Netizen ") may publish revised and/or new versions 
          of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
          distinguishing version number.

          6.2. Effect of New Versions.
          Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
          License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
          version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
          of any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one
          other than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to
          Covered Code created under this License.

          6.3. Derivative Works.
          If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
          only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
          governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
          the phrases "Netizen", "NOSL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not 
          appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from 
          this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the 
          license contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source 
          License and Xen Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the 
          Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described 
          in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
          this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

          COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
          WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
          DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
          THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
          IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
          YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
          COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
          OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
          ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

          7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided 
          to the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, 
          implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject
          matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded.  
          Where legislation implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty 
          and that legislation avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract 
          excluding or modifying the application of or the exercise of or 
          liability under such term, such term shall be deemed to be included 
          in this Agreement.  However, the liability of Supplier for any breach 
          of such term shall be limited, at the option of Supplier, to any one 
          or more of the following: if the breach related to goods: the 
          replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the repair 
          of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of 
          acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the 
          goods repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying 
          of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the 
          services supplied again.

    8. TERMINATION.

          8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
          such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
          sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
          survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
          nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
          shall survive.

          8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
          claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
          or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
          You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

          (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
          Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
          shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
          unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
          agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
          royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
          Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
          the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
          of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
          mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
          is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
          Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
          the 60 day notice period specified above.

          (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
          Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
          any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
          and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
          sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
          Participant.

          8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
          alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
          indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
          by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
          infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
          granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
          into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
          license.

          8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
          all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
          which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
          prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
          (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
          DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
          OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
          ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
          CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
          WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
          COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
          INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
          LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
          RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
          PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
          EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
          THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

          The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
          48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
          software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
          terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
          C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
          all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
          rights set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

          This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
          matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
          unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
          necessary to make it enforceable.

          This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the 
          law of the State of Victoria.  The parties irrevocably submit to the 
          exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and 
          any Courts hearing appeals from such Courts.  This Agreement is 
          deemed to have been made in Victoria.

          The application of the United Nations Convention on
          Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
          Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
          shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
          License.

    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

          As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
          responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
          out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
          work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
          responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
          shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

          Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
          "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
          Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
          Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
          by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Application of License.\n      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n      an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n      Section 3.5.\n\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n      3.3. Description of Modifications.\n      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n           (a) Third Party Claims.\n           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n           distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n           (b) Contributor APIs.\n           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n           also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n                (c)    Representations.\n           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n           this License.\n\n      3.5. Required Notices.\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n      terms You offer.\n\n      3.7. Larger Works.\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n      understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n      6.1. New Versions.\n      Netizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and/or new versions \n      of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n      distinguishing version number.\n\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one\n      other than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n      Covered Code created under this License.\n\n      6.3. Derivative Works.\n      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n      the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not \n      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from \n      this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the \n      license contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source \n      License and Xen Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the \n      Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described \n      in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n      this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n      7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided \n      to the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, \n      implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject\n      matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded.  \n      Where legislation implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty \n      and that legislation avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract \n      excluding or modifying the application of or the exercise of or \n      liability under such term, such term shall be deemed to be included \n      in this Agreement.  However, the liability of Supplier for any breach \n      of such term shall be limited, at the option of Supplier, to any one \n      or more of the following: if the breach related to goods: the \n      replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the repair \n      of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of \n      acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      goods repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying \n      of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      services supplied again.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n      shall survive.\n\n      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n      You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n      the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n      Participant.\n\n      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n      license.\n\n      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n      prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n      The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n      software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n      rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n      necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the \n      law of the State of Victoria.  The parties irrevocably submit to the \n      exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and \n      any Courts hearing appeals from such Courts.  This Agreement is \n      deemed to have been made in Victoria.\n\n      The application of the United Nations Convention on\n      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n      License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n      \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A - Netizen Open Source License\n\n      ``The contents of this file are subject to the Netizen Open Source\n      License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except \n      in compliance with the License.

Availability of Source Code.\n      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n      3.3. Description of Modifications.\n      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n           (a) Third Party Claims.\n           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n           distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n           (b) Contributor APIs.\n           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n           also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n                (c)    Representations.\n           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n           this License.\n\n      3.5. Required Notices.\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n      terms You offer.\n\n      3.7. Larger Works.\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n      understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n      6.1. New Versions.\n      Netizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and/or new versions \n      of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n      distinguishing version number.\n\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one\n      other than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n      Covered Code created under this License.\n\n      6.3. Derivative Works.\n      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n      the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not \n      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from \n      this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the \n      license contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source \n      License and Xen Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the \n      Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described \n      in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n      this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n      7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided \n      to the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, \n      implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject\n      matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded.  \n      Where legislation implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty \n      and that legislation avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract \n      excluding or modifying the application of or the exercise of or \n      liability under such term, such term shall be deemed to be included \n      in this Agreement.  However, the liability of Supplier for any breach \n      of such term shall be limited, at the option of Supplier, to any one \n      or more of the following: if the breach related to goods: the \n      replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the repair \n      of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of \n      acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      goods repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying \n      of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      services supplied again.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n      shall survive.\n\n      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n      You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n      the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n      Participant.\n\n      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n      license.\n\n      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n      prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n      The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n      software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n      rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n      necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the \n      law of the State of Victoria.  The parties irrevocably submit to the \n      exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and \n      any Courts hearing appeals from such Courts.  This Agreement is \n      deemed to have been made in Victoria.\n\n      The application of the United Nations Convention on\n      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n      License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n      \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A - Netizen Open Source License\n\n      ``The contents of this file are subject to the Netizen Open Source\n      License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except \n      in compliance with the License.

The Initial Developer Grant.\n      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property\n      claims:\n           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n           trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,\n           modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\n           Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or\n           as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n           (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or\n           selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,\n           sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the\n           Original Code (or portions thereof).\n\n           (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are\n           effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes\n           Original Code under the terms of this License.\n\n           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n           granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)\n           separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused\n           by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the\n           combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.\n\n      2.2. Contributor Grant.\n      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n           display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n           created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an\n           unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code\n           and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n           selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n           and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions\n           of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have\n           made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\n           Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of\n           Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\n           Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n           (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n           effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of\n           the Covered Code.\n\n           (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n           granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n           Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;\n           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of\n           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made\n           by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the\n           Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\n           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\n           that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n      3.1. Application of License.\n      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n      an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n      Section 3.5.\n\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n      3.3. Description of Modifications.\n      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n           (a) Third Party Claims.\n           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n           distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n           (b) Contributor APIs.\n           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n           also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n                (c)    Representations.\n           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n           this License.\n\n      3.5. Required Notices.\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n      terms You offer.\n\n      3.7. Larger Works.\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n      understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n      6.1. New Versions.\n      Netizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and/or new versions \n      of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n      distinguishing version number.\n\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one\n      other than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n      Covered Code created under this License.\n\n      6.3. Derivative Works.\n      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n      the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not \n      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from \n      this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the \n      license contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source \n      License and Xen Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the \n      Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described \n      in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n      this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n      7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided \n      to the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, \n      implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject\n      matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded.  \n      Where legislation implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty \n      and that legislation avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract \n      excluding or modifying the application of or the exercise of or \n      liability under such term, such term shall be deemed to be included \n      in this Agreement.  However, the liability of Supplier for any breach \n      of such term shall be limited, at the option of Supplier, to any one \n      or more of the following: if the breach related to goods: the \n      replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the repair \n      of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of \n      acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      goods repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying \n      of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the \n      services supplied again.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n      shall survive.\n\n      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n      You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n      the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n      Participant.\n\n      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n      license.\n\n      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n      prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n      The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n      software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n      rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n      necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the \n      law of the State of Victoria.  The parties irrevocably submit to the \n      exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and \n      any Courts hearing appeals from such Courts.  This Agreement is \n      deemed to have been made in Victoria.\n\n      The application of the United Nations Convention on\n      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n      License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n      \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A - Netizen Open Source License\n\n      ``The contents of this file are subject to the Netizen Open Source\n      License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except \n      in compliance with the License.
