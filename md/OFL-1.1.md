    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

    Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

    PREAMBLE
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
    with others.

    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

    DEFINITIONS
    "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
    Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
    include source files, build scripts and documentation.

    "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
    copyright statement(s).

    "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
    or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
    Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
    new environment.

    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
    Software, subject to the following conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
    presented to the users.

    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
    Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
    permission.

    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created
    using the Font Software.

    TERMINATION
    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
    not met.

    DISCLAIMER
    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
    OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
    COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
    FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
    OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

It attempts to be a compromise between the values of the free software and typeface design communities. It is used for almost all open source font projects, including those by Adobe, Google and Mozilla.\n\nhow: Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your font source and copy the text of the license into the file. Replace [year] with the current year and [fullname] ([email]) with the name and contact email address of each copyright holder. You may take the additional step of appending a Reserved Font Name notice. This option requires anyone making modifications to change the font's name, and is not ideal for web fonts (which all users will modify by changing formats and subsetting for their own needs.)\n\nnote: This license doesn't require source provision, but recommends it. All files derived from OFL files must remain licensed under the OFL.\n\nusing:\n\npermissions:\n  - private-use\n  - commercial-use\n  - modifications\n  - distribution\n\nconditions:\n  - include-copyright\n  - same-license\n\nlimitations:\n  - liability\n  - warranty\n\n---\n\nCopyright (c) [year] [fullname] ([email])\n\nThis Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\nThis license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nSIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREAMBLE\nThe goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide\ndevelopment of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation\nefforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and\nopen framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership\nwith others.\n\nThe OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and\nredistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,\nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\nrequirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\nto any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\nHolder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may\ninclude source files, build scripts and documentation.\n\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\ncopyright statement(s).\n\n\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\ndistributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\nor substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\nOriginal Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\nnew environment.\n\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\nwriter or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n\nPERMISSION AND CONDITIONS\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\nredistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\nSoftware, subject to the following conditions:\n\n1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\nin Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n\n2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\nredistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\ncontains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\nincluded either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\nin the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\nbinary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n\n3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\nName(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\nCopyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\npresented to the users.\n\n4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\nSoftware shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\nModified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\nCopyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\npermission.\n\n5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\nmust be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\ndistributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to\nremain under this license does not apply to any document created\nusing the Font Software.\n\nTERMINATION\nThis license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are\nnot met.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nTHE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT\nOF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.
