    third condition, is also in use. This is because even a generous
    copyright license does not implicitly forfeit the copyright holder's
    "right of publicity". In other words, even if a license does not
    forbid you from claiming that the copyright holder or other parties
    endorses or promotes your work, the law generally does. We're not
