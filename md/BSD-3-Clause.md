-   **↑** Rating is: Bronze (source: [BlueOak License
    List](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list "BlueOak License List"))

-   **↑** Note that a 2-clause form of the BSD license, removing the
    third condition, is also in use. This is because even a generous
    copyright license does not implicitly forfeit the copyright holder's
    "right of publicity". In other words, even if a license does not
    forbid you from claiming that the copyright holder or other parties
    endorses or promotes your work, the law generally does. We're not
    aware of any exceptions. (source: [Debian Free Software
    Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses "Debian Free Software Guidelines"))
