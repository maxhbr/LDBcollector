    3DFX GLIDE Source Code General Public License

    1. PREAMBLE

    This license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application
    program interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar
    to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open
    standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these
    licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software,
    any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing
    the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general
    use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that
    the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made
    available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be
    subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work.

    This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the
    standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire
    derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license
    nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for
    the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the
    identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the
    licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
    distribution and modification follow.

    2. DEFINITIONS

    2.1 This License applies to any program (or other "work") which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    distributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General
    Public License.

    2.2 The term "Program" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX's
    GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.

    2.3 "Derivative Work" means, for the purpose of the License, that
    portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable
    portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or
    with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that
    performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other
    portions of a work.

    2.4 "Modifications of the Program" means any work, which includes a
    Derivative Work, and includes the whole of such work.

    2.5 "License" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.

    2.6 The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, any
    associated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control
    compilation and installation of the executable work.

    2.7 "3dfx" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc.


    3. LICENSED ACTIVITIES

    3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
    Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the
    provision of section 3.3 and provided also that:

    (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
    an appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice
    that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can
    only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as
    set forth in section 5;

    (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
    to the absence of any warranty; and

    (c) do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior
    written permission of 3dfx, and

    (d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy
    of this License.


    3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your
    copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and
    distribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3
    and provided that you also meet all of the following conditions:

    (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
    of a Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that
    recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work
    can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty
    as set forth in section 5;

    (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
    to the absence of any warranty; and

    (c) give all recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this
    License along with the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily
    receive a copy of this License.

    (d) You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work
    to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
    date of any change.

    (e) You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or
    publish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
    terms of this License.

    (f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the
    prior written permission of 3dfx.

    (g) If the Derivative Work normally reads commands
    interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
    such interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows:

    "COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS
    SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE
    TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE,
    INC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE
    DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM
    INFO@3DFX.COM)."

    (h) The requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the
    modified work as a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not
    the intent of this License to claim rights or contest your rights to
    work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of Derivative Works.


    3.3 DISTRIBUTION

    (a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are
    distributed must include in the file headers the following language
    verbatim:

    "THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED
    ONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. THERE IS NO
    RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF
    3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM
    THE DISTRIBUTOR OR BY CONTACTING 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC (info@3dfx.com).
    THIS PROGRAM. IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A
    FULL TEXT OF THE NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS.

    USE, DUPLICATION OR DISCLOSURE BY THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBJECT TO
    RESTRICTIONS AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION (C)(1)(II) OF THE RIGHTS
    IN TECHNICAL DATA AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE CLAUSE AT DFARS 252.227-7013,
    AND/OR IN SIMILAR OR SUCCESSOR CLAUSES IN THE FAR, DOD OR NASA FAR
    SUPPLEMENT. UNPUBLISHED RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF
    THE UNITED STATES.

    COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"

    (b) You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2
    provided that you also do one of the following:

    (1) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
    terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or,

    (2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
    your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    (3) Accompany it with the information you received as
    to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
    is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
    the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
    accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.)

    (c) The source code distributed need not include anything
    that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with
    the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
    system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
    accompanies the executable code.

    (d) If distribution of executable code or object code is made
    by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
    equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts
    as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    (e) Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative
    Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and
    successor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and
    Derivative Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
    enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    (f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without
    the prior written permission of 3dfx.

    (g) You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Program or any Derivative Works except as expressly provided under
    this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
    distribute the Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.


    4. MISCELLANEOUS

    4.1 Acceptance of this License is voluntary. By using, modifying or
    distributing the Program or any Derivative Work, you indicate your
    acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
    for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
    it. Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this
    License is in violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws.

    4.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works
    is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
    interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
    this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
    or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    4.3 This License is to be construed according to the laws of the
    State of California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the
    State of California in the event it is necessary to enforce the
    provisions of this License.


    5. NO WARRANTIES

    5.1 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS"AS IS"
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
    AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORK IS WITH YOU.
    SHOULD THE PROGRAM OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    5.2 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL 3DFX
    INTERACTIVE, INC., OR ANY OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
    WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS AS
    PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS (INCLUDING BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
    SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM OR
    DERIVATIVE WORKS TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
