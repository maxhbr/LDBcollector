    The Clarified Artistic License

    Preamble

    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
    Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
    semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
    giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
    Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
    reasonable modifications.

    Definitions:

        "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
        created through textual modification.

        "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
        Copyright Holder as specified below.

        "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
        copyrights for the package.

        "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
        Package.

        "Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this
        Package to another party.

        "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use
        the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. 
        It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
        the same conditions they received it.

    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
    disclaimers.

    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
    derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from
    the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be
    considered the Standard Version.

    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
    provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
    how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least
    ONE of the following:

        a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
        them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
        Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
        major network archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or
        by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in
        the Standard Version of the Package.

        b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
        organization.

        c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
        with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
        a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
        documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

        e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified
        Package permission to make your modifications Freely Available in
        some specific way.


    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

        a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
        files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
        on where to get the Standard Version.

        b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
        the Package with your modifications.

        c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
        document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
        with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

        e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your
        modifications, by mail order.

    5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this
    Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee
    you choose for that support.  You may not charge a license fee for the
    right to use this Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in
    aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs
    as part of a larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software
    distribution, and charge license fees for other parts of that software
    distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
    product of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You may
    embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by
    linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation,
    provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so
    embedded.

    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
    output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
    the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and
    may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If
    such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
    so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable
    image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as
    a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
    of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an
    executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
    supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
    subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall
    not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input
    as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language
    in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the
    language.

    8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
    distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package
    is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this
    Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial
    distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this
    Package.

    9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
    promote products derived from this software without specific prior
    written permission.

    10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                                The End
