    # Polyform Small Business License 1.0.0

    <https://polyformproject.org/licenses/small-business/1.0.0>

    ## Acceptance

    In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
    to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
    your licenses.

    ## Copyright License

    The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
    software to do everything you might do with the software
    that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
    in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
    only distribute the software according to [Distribution
    License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
    based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
    License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

    ## Distribution License

    The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
    to distribute copies of the software.  Your license
    to distribute covers distributing the software with
    changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works
    License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

    ## Notices

    You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
    the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
    URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
    beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
    with the software.  For example:

    > Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)

    ## Changes and New Works License

    The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
    make changes and new works based on the software for any
    permitted purpose.

    ## Patent License

    The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
    covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
    to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

    ## Fair Use

    You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
    law. These terms do not limit them.

    ## Small Business

    Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for
    a permitted purpose if your company has fewer than 100 total
    individuals working as employees and independent contractors,
    and less than 1,000,000 USD (2019) total revenue in the prior
    tax year.  Adjust this revenue threshold for inflation according
    to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price
    index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items,
    not seasonally adjusted, with 1982â€“1984=100 reference base.

    ## No Other Rights

    These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
    your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
    granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
    any other licenses.

    ## Patent Defense

    If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
    contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
    for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
    your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
    immediately for work on behalf of your company.

    ## Violations

    The first time you are notified in writing that you have
    violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
    not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
    continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
    and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
    32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
    end immediately.

    ## No Liability

    ***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
    any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
    to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
    or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

    ## Definitions

    The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these
    terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes
    available under these terms.

    **You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these
    terms.

    **Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship,
    or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all
    organizations that have control over, are under the control of,
    or are under common control with that organization.  **Control**
    means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity,
    or the power to direct its management and policies by vote,
    contract, or otherwise.  Control can be direct or indirect.

    **Your licenses** are all the licenses granted to you for the
    software under these terms.

    **Use** means anything you do with the software requiring one
    of your licenses.
