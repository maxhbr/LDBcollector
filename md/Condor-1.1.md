    redistribution of this Software, with or without modification,  in

    this license including sublicenses by you is subject to the following
    conditions:

       which is provided with the Software.

    Alternatively, if that is where third-party acknowledgments
       normally appear, this acknowledgment must be reproduced in the
       Software itself.

    Any academic report, publication, or other academic disclosure 
       of results obtained with this Software will acknowledge this
       Software's use by an appropriate citation.

    The name Condor

       Wisconsin-Madison.  The trademark may not be used to endorse or
       promote software, or products derived therefrom, and, other than
       as required by section 2 and 3 above, it may not be affixed to modified
       redistributions of this Software without the prior written
       approval, obtainable via email to condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu.

    To the extent that patent claims licensable by the University of
       Wisconsin-Madison are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of

       free perpetual license under such patent claims, with the rights
       for you to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
       transfer the Software in source code and object code form and
       derivative works.   This patent license shall apply to the
       combination of the Software with other software if, at the time
       the Software is added by you, such addition of the Software causes
       such combination to be covered by such patent claims. This patent
       license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
       the Software.  No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    If you or any subsequent sub-licensee (a ``Recipient") institutes

       counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software infringes
       such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
       (directly or indirectly) under the patent license above shall
       terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  All
       sublicenses to the Software which have been properly granted prior
       to termination shall survive any termination of said patent
       license, if not otherwise terminated pursuant to this section.
