      CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

    Version 2.1 dated 2013-06-21


        Notice

    This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
    of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
    the two main principles guiding its drafting:

      * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
        of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
      * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
        is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
        property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
        holders of the economic rights over software.

    The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre]) 
    license are: 

    Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives - CEA, a
    public scientific, technical and industrial research establishment,
    having its principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le
    Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

    Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
    and technological establishment, having its principal place of business
    at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

    Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique -
    Inria, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its
    principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP
    105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.


        Preamble

    The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
    the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
    license within the framework of an open source distribution model.

    The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
    users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

    In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
    modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
    with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
    economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

    In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
    and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
    the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
    complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
    developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
    knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
    suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
    enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
    more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
    security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
    provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
    removed herefrom.

    This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
    the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

    Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the
    CeCILL licenses family (http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html) for any 
    necessary clarification.

    The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
    all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
    and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
    and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
    distribution of said Initial Software.

    least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2 <#term>.


          6.2 OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS

    The Licensee who develops a Contribution is the owner of the
    intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by
    applicable law.


          6.3 OVER THE EXTERNAL MODULES

    The Licensee who develops an External Module is the owner of the
    intellectual property rights over this External Module as defined by
    applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
    govern its distribution.


          6.4 JOINT PROVISIONS

    The Licensee expressly undertakes:

     1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
        notices attached to the Software;

     2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies of
        the Software modified or not.

    The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
    intellectual property rights on the Software of the Holder and/or
    Contributors, and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any
    and all measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual
    property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors.


        Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES

    7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
    provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.

    However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
    terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
    maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
    Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
    shall incur liability therefor.

    7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
    its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
    itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
    Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
    warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
    shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
    and the Licensee.


        Article 8 - LIABILITY

    8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
    entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
    from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
    Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.

    8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
    this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
    (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
    obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
    Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
    generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
    agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
    loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
    opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
    legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
    shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
    any or all compensation from the Licensor.


        Article 9 - WARRANTY

    9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
    state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
    possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
    possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
    attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
    modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
    reserved for experienced users.

    The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
    the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
    order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
    or properties.

    9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
    to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
    rights set forth in Article 5 <#scope>).

    9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
    the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
    that provided for in Article 9.2 <#good-faith> and, in particular,
    without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
    innovative or relevant nature.

    Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
    from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
    be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
    configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

    9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
    Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
    relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
    the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
    arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
    instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
    Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
    the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
    expertise for its defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be
    decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
    Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
    disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
    name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
    prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
    of a trademark.


        Article 10 - TERMINATION

    10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
    hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
    thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
    remained ineffective.

    10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
    authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
    licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
    shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
    with the terms and conditions hereof.


        Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS


          11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS

    Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to
    perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force
    majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective
    functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications
    networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by
    government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
    fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

    11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
    one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be
    interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to
    invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

    11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
    whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
    purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
    Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
    terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
    unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
    representatives.

    11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
    conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
    said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
    the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
    text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
    of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
    cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.


          11.5 LANGUAGE

    The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions
    are deemed authentic.


        Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT

    12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this
    Agreement.

    12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is
    protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who
    reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the
    Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may
    address new issues encountered by Free Software.

    12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may
    only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement
    or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of Article 5.3.4
    <#compatibility>.


        Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

    13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to
    endeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes
    that may arise during the performance of the Agreement.

    13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their
    occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the
    disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having
    jurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.
