    FREE SOFTWARE LICENSING AGREEMENT CeCILL
    ========================================

    Notice
    ------

    This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of  discussions
    between its authors  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  two  main
    principles guiding its drafting:
       - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law  of
         torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
         to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
       - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution  of  free
         software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

    The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :
    CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

    Commissariat ‡ l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical  and
    industrial establishment, having its principal place of  business  at  31-33
    rue de la FÈdÈration, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

    Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique -  CNRS,  a  public  scientific
    and technological establishment, having its principal place of  business  at
    3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

    Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA,  a
    public scientific and  technological  establishment,  having  its  principal
    place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt,  BP  105,  78153  Le
    Chesnay cedex.


    PREAMBLE
    --------


    The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the
    right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license
    within the framework of an "open source" distribution model.

    The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for
    users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent
    redistribution operations.

    As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
    and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a
    limited warranty and  the software's author, the holder of the economic
    rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.

    In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
    associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
    the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  
    mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means 
    that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having
    in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
    the Software's suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions
    enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
    generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.
    This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is
    not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. 

    This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the
    economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

    itself. Said warranty,  and  the  financial  terms  and  conditions  of  its
    application, shall be subject to a separate instrument executed between  the
    Licensor and the Licensee.


    Article 8  - LIABILITY
    ----------------------


    8.1. Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor  fail  to
    fulfill all or part of its obligations  hereunder,  the  Licensee  shall  be
    entitled to claim compensation for the direct loss suffered  as a result of
    a fault on the part of the Licensor, subject to providing evidence of it. 

    8.2. The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under  this
    Licensing Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result ,  in  particular:
    (i) of loss due the Licensee's total  or  partial  failure  to  fulfill  its
    obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software's use  or
    performance that  is  suffered  by  the  Licensee,  when  the  latter  is  a

    all compensation from the Licensor.


    Article 9  - WARRANTY
    ---------------------


    9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards
    scientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was
    distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor
    for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the
    Licensee's attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,
    using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are
    reserved for experienced users.

    The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the
    product's suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,
    and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or
    property.

    9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to
    grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights
    set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).

    9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by  the
    Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than
    that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all
    warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant
    nature.

    Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from
    any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be
    compatible  with   the   Licensee's   own   equipment   and   its   software
    configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee's requirements.

    9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the
    Software does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right
    relating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.
    Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or
    all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the
    use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should
    such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall
    provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such
    technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case
    basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a
    memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as
    regards the Licensee's use of the Software's  name.  No  warranty  shall  be
    provided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the
    Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.


    Article 10  - TERMINATION
    -------------------------


    10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations
    hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty
    (30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained
    ineffective.

    10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall  no  longer  be
    authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or  all
    licenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement
    shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with
    the terms and conditions hereof.


    Article 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
    --------------------------------------


    11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS

    Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or  failure  to  perform
    the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event  of  force  majeure,  an
    act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning,  or
    interruptions affecting  the  electricity  or  telecommunications  networks,
    blocking of the network following a virus attack, the  intervention  of  the
    government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,  fire,
    explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

    11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several  occasions,  to
    invoke  one  or  several  of  the  provisions   hereof,   shall   under   no
    circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the  interested  Party  of
    its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

    11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,
    whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,
    and  constitutes  the  entirety  of  the  agreement  between  said   Parties
    concerning said purpose. No supplement or  modification  to  the  terms  and
    conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is
    made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

    11.4. In the event that one or several of  the  provisions  hereof  were  to
    conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said
    act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make
    the necessary amendments so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  said  act  or
    legislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.
    Similarly, the fact that a provision of  the  Agreement  may   be  null  and
    void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole
    to be null and void.

    11.5. LANGUAGE

    The Agreement is drafted in both French and  English.  In  the  event  of  a
    conflict as  regards  construction,  the  French  version  shall  be  deemed
    authentic.

    and may only be modified by the authors of the  License,  that  reserve  the
    right to periodically publish updates or  new  versions  of  the  Agreement,
    each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues
    encountered by Free Software.

    12.3. Any  or  all  Software  distributed  under  a  given  version  of  the
    Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under  the  same  version  of
    the Agreement, or  a  subsequent  version,  subject  to  the  provisions  of
    article 5.3.4.


    Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
    -------------------------------------------

    from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are  necessary,  the
    disagreements or disputes shall be  referred  to  the  Paris  Courts  having
    jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.


                                                       Version 1.1 of 10/26/2004
