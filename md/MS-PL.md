    Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)

    This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,
    you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the
    software.

    1. Definitions

    The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution"
    have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

    A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
    software.

    A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
    license.

    "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its
    contribution.

    2. Grant of Rights

    (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
    conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
    exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
    contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
    contribution or any derivative works that you create.

    (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
    conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
    exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make,
    have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its
    contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the
    software.

    3. Conditions and Limitations

    (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
    contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

    (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
    claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
    to the software ends automatically.

    (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
    copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
    software.

    (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may
    do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with
    your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or
    object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this
    license.

    (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
    contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have
    additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot
    change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude
    the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
    non-infringement.
