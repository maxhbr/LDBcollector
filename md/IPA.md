    The Licensor grants to the Recipient a license to use the Licensed Program in any and all countries in accordance with each of the provisions set forth in this Agreement. However, any and all rights underlying in the Licensed Program shall be held by the Licensor. In no sense is this Agreement intended to transfer any right relating to the Licensed Program held by the Licensor except as specifically set forth herein or any right relating to any trademark, trade name, or service mark to the Recipient.

    1.         The Recipient may install the Licensed Program on any number of Computers and use the same in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement.

    5.         If any Recipient performs Reproduction or Other Exploitation of a Digital Document File in which Embedded Fonts of the Licensed Program are used only for rendering the Digital Content within such Digital Document File then such Recipient shall have no further obligations under this Agreement in relation to such actions.

    (b)    any additional file created by the font developing program in the course of creating the Derived Program that can be used for further modification of the Derived Program, if any.

    (2)                It is required to also Redistribute means to enable recipients of the Derived Program to replace the Derived Program with the Licensed Program first released under this License (the "Original Program").

    (3)                The Recipient must license the Derived Program under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

    4.         The Licensor is under no obligation to respond to any technical questions or inquiries, or provide any other user support in connection with the installation, use or the Reproduction and Other Exploitation of the Licensed Program or Derived Programs thereof.
