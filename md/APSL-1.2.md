General Comments

-   “In addition to the requirements of strong copyleft licenses,
    network copyleft licenses require you to share larger programs that
    you build with the licensed software not just when you give copies
    to others, but also when you run the software for others to use over
    the Internet or another network.” (source: [BlueOak License

-   “Strong copyleft licenses require you to share both the licensed
    software (like the weak copyleft licenses, and larger programs that
