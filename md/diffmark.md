General Comments
----------------

-   “Per Fedora, this extremely minimal and permissive license was found
    in diffmark (0.08). While poorly written, our interpretation of the
    text permits use, modification, and distribution. It also permits
    wearing it as a hat or eating it for lunch, although neither of
    those cases are recommended. This would perhaps be considered
    Copyright only, except that no requirement of retention of copyright
    is present, and the copyright holder is disclaiming liability
    (albeit, poorly). This license is Free, and GPL compatible. ”
