    license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: 

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
      sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or

      Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or
      devices, including but not limited to Modifications.

    3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

    3.1 Application of License.
    The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under the terms
    of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,
    and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
    You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
    that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor
    Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The
    Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the
    Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the
    Contributor Version. In the event that the Modifications do not meet such
    requirements, You agree to publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards
    protocol resulting from implementation of Your Modifications and a reference
    implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code
    form, and to make any such deviation and reference implementation or
    Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as this license
    on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first customer shipment
    of Your Modifications.

    3.2 Required Notices.
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
    is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
    structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
    directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
    one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice
    described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
    for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
    relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
    of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
    not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than
    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability
    incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if the
    requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code, and if
    You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
    available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously
    included in any notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation
    or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original
    Code. You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version of
    the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
    terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the
    terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under
    a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
    from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the
    Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.4 Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code not
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
    product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
    fulfilled for the Original Code.

    4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
    respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or
    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
    maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
    affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
    3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
