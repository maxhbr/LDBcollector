    you build with the licensed software not just when you give copies
    to others, but also when you run the software for others to use over
    the Internet or another network.” (source: [BlueOak License

    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or
    other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
    ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered
    Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
    responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple. You must obtain the
    recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple
    harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against
    Apple by reason of any such Additional Terms.

    7. Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new
    versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be
    given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been
    published under a particular version of this License, You may continue
    to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
    such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
    License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple has the right to
    modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
    License.

    8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Original Code may contain in whole or
    in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The
    Original Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of
    data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly
    acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or any portion
    thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE ORIGINAL CODE IS
    PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND
    AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND
    9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS
    "APPLE") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
    AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY
    RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE
    ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF
    THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR- FREE, OR THAT
    DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN
    INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED
    REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE
    SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Original Code is not
    intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
    navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in
    which case the failure of the Original Code could lead to death,
    personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

    9. Liability.

    9.1 Infringement.  If any portion of, or functionality implemented by,
    the Original Code becomes the subject of a claim of infringement,
    Apple may, at its option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary
    for Apple and You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b)
    modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer infringing;
    or (c) suspend Your rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and
    distribute the Affected Original Code until a final determination of
    the claim is made by a court or governmental administrative agency of
    competent jurisdiction and Apple lifts the suspension as set forth
    below.  Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon
    Apple's posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that
    is used for implementation of this License.  Upon such final
    determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the
    payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction,
    modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original
    Code, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected
    Original Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site
    that is used for implementation of this License.  If Apple suspends
    Your rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall
    be construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable
    law, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing
    code or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third
    party.

    9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO
    USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY
    OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY
    OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF
    ANY REMEDY.  In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
    damages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars
    ($50.00).

    10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the
    trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac
    OS X Server" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple
    (collectively "Apple Marks") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse
    or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
    permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third
    party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
    http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

    11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to
    the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple
    ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be
    automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole
    discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this
    License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or
    may choose not to license them at all.  Apple's development, use,
    reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered
    Code will not be subject to this License.

    12. Termination.

    12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
       terminate:

    (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
    any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
    days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of
    the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically
    without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this
    License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.

    12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to
    immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,
    sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all
    copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control.
    All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted
    prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.
    Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
    termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited
    to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  Neither party will be
    liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
    solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
    terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to
    any other right or remedy of either party.

    13.  Miscellaneous.

    13.1 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
    defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights
    in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to
    the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial
    license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with
    FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
    Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
    Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
    Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S.
    Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
    forth herein.

    13.2 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as
    creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
    legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to
    the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
    otherwise.

    13.3 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair
    Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
    it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
    same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
    Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
    develop, produce, market or distribute.

    13.4 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision
    of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of
    that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides
    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
    will not apply to this License.

    13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent
    jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
    to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
    the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
    and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
    continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
    specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
    enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
    immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
    the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
    possession or control.

    13.6 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution
    between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
    Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
    the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
    courts within that District with respect to this License. The
    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
    International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

    13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the
    entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
    matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the
    United States and the State of California, except that body of
    California law concerning conflicts of law.

    Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
    clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
    that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
    parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
    connexes soient rediges en anglais.

Neither party will be\nliable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort\nsolely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its\nterms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to\nany other right or remedy of either party.\n\n13.

Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nwill not apply to this License.\n\n13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\njurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,\nto be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to\nthe maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits\nand intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will\ncontinue in full force and effect.

You acknowledge that the Original Code is not\nintended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft\nnavigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in\nwhich case the failure of the Original Code could lead to death,\npersonal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n\n9.

Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon\nApple's posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that\nis used for implementation of this License.  Upon such final\ndetermination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the\npayment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction,\nmodification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original\nCode, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected\nOriginal Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site\nthat is used for implementation of this License.  If Apple suspends\nYour rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall\nbe construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable\nlaw, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing\ncode or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third\nparty.\n\n9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE\nLIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO\nUSE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY\nOF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY\nOR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF\nANY REMEDY.  In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all\ndamages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars\n($50.00).\n\n10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the\ntrademarks or trade names \"Apple\", \"Apple Computer\", \"Mac OS X\", \"Mac\nOS X Server\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple\n(collectively \"Apple Marks\") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse\nor promote products derived from the Original Code other than as\npermitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third\nparty trademark usage guidelines which are posted at\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n\n11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to\nthe Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple\n(\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will not be\nautomatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole\ndiscretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this\nLicense, or on different terms from those contained in this License or\nmay choose not to license them at all.  Apple's development, use,\nreproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered\nCode will not be subject to this License.\n\n12. Termination.\n\n12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n   terminate:\n\n(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with\nany term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30\ndays of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of\nthe circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically\nwithout notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this\nLicense, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.\n\n12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to\nimmediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,\nsublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all\ncopies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control.\nAll sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted\nprior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.\nProvisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the\ntermination of this License shall survive, including but not limited\nto Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  Neither party will be\nliable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort\nsolely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its\nterms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to\nany other right or remedy of either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\ndefined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights\nin the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to\nthe public as defined in this License.

This License will not be construed as\ncreating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of\nlegal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to\nthe contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or\notherwise.\n\n13.3 Independent Development.

Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\nof this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of\nthat or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nwill not apply to this License.\n\n13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\njurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,\nto be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to\nthe maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits\nand intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will\ncontinue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nif applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or\nspecifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the\nenforceability of either of those Sections, this License will\nimmediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of\nthe Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your\npossession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\nbetween You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the\nNorthern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to\nthe personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal\ncourts within that District with respect to this License. The\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\nentire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\nmatter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\nUnited States and the State of California, except that body of\nCalifornia law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

Upon such final\ndetermination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the\npayment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction,\nmodification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original\nCode, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected\nOriginal Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site\nthat is used for implementation of this License.  If Apple suspends\nYour rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall\nbe construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable\nlaw, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing\ncode or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third\nparty.\n\n9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE\nLIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO\nUSE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY\nOF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY\nOR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF\nANY REMEDY.

Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to\nthe Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple\n(\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will not be\nautomatically subject to this License.

Upon termination, You agree to\nimmediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,\nsublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all\ncopies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control.\nAll sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted\nprior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.\nProvisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the\ntermination of this License shall survive, including but not limited\nto Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  Neither party will be\nliable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort\nsolely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its\nterms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to\nany other right or remedy of either party.\n\n13.

Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\nof this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of\nthat or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nwill not apply to this License.\n\n13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\njurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,\nto be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to\nthe maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits\nand intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will\ncontinue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nif applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or\nspecifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the\nenforceability of either of those Sections, this License will\nimmediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of\nthe Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your\npossession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\nbetween You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the\nNorthern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to\nthe personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal\ncourts within that District with respect to this License. The\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.
