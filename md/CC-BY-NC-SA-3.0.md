         required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
         Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
         required by Section 4(d), as requested.

        b.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
         License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License;
         (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
         contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
         3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
         every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
         any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
         of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
         the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
         Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included
         in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform
         the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
         restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted
         to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to
         the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
         from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

        c.You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner
         that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
         compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
         file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
         advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
         compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

        d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
         You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
         notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) 
        the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
         Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
         publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
         notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)
         the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,
         if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to
         the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),
         in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
         "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
         Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any
         reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
         minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
         Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent
         as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
         use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out
         above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
         or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
         Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
         prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

        e.For the avoidance of doubt:

            i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
             to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
             the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
             of the rights granted under this License;

            ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
             to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
             the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
             You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for
             a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
             and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
             licensing scheme; and,

            iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether
             individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
             administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
             rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
             noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

        f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
         applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself
         or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
         or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
         Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
         in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
         Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
         action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will
         waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
         the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under
          Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    6. Limitation on Liability.

     EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. Termination

        a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach
         by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
         Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
         provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
         Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

        b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration
         of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
         to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
         provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
         other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
         this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

    8. Miscellaneous

        a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers
         to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
         to You under this License.

        b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
         a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
         under this License.

        c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
         not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
         without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
         the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

        d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
         such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
         waiver or consent.

        e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work
         licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
         the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
         appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
         agreement of the Licensor and You.

        f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing
         the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
         (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of
         1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
         Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect
         in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
         according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
         in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
         copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
         rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
         license of any rights under applicable law.

A work\n     that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above)\n     for the purposes of this License.\n\n    c.\"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or\n     Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n    d.\"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by\n     Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n    e.\"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work\n     under the terms of this License.\n\n    f.\"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals,\n     entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified,\n     the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians,\n     dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform\n     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the\n     producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or\n     other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n    g.\"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License\n     including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,\n     whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature;\n     a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show;\n     a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,\n     architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an\n     illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\n     architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data\n     to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus\n     performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n    h.\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously\n     violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\n     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n    i.\"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the\n     public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means\n     or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members\n     of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;\n     to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public\n     of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast\n     and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n    j.\"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by\n     sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,\n     including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n     medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights.\n\n Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant.\n\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    a.to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce\n     the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n    b.to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation\n     in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that\n     changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked\n     \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\n     \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n    c.to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n    d.to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions.\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must\n     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of\n     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work\n     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise\n     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense\n     the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures\n     on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\n     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work\n     as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work\n     itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice\n     from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n    b.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this\n     License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License;\n     (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n     3.0 US) (\"Applicable License\"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n     every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\n     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\n     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n     the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\n     Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included\n     in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform\n     the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that\n     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted\n     to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to\n     the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n     from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n    c.You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner\n     that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\n     compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\n     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial\n     advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\n     compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n    d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,\n     You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\n     notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) \n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n     Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,\n     publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright\n     notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)\n     the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,\n     if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\n     the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),\n     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n     \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original\n     Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\n     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\n     minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\n     as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\n     above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert\n     or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\n     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    e.For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n        i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n         of the rights granted under this License;\n\n        ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\n         a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n         licensing scheme; and,\n\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether\n         individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\n         rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n    f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by\n     applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\n     or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\n     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\n     in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\n     Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\n     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will\n     waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by\n     the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\n      Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability.\n\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach\n     by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\n     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\n     provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n    b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\n     of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\n     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any\n     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\n     this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers\n     to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\n     to You under this License.\n\n    b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient\n     a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n     under this License.\n\n    c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall\n     not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless\n     such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\n     waiver or consent.\n\n    e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work\n     licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n     the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\n     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing\n     the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\n     (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of\n     1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect\n     in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\n     in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\n     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\n     license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Restrictions.\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must\n     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of\n     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work\n     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise\n     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense\n     the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures\n     on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\n     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work\n     as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work\n     itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice\n     from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n    b.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this\n     License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License;\n     (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n     3.0 US) (\"Applicable License\"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n     every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\n     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\n     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n     the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\n     Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included\n     in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform\n     the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that\n     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted\n     to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to\n     the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n     from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n    c.You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner\n     that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\n     compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\n     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial\n     advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\n     compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n    d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,\n     You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\n     notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) \n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n     Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,\n     publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright\n     notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)\n     the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,\n     if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\n     the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),\n     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n     \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original\n     Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\n     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\n     minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\n     as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\n     above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert\n     or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\n     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    e.For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n        i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n         of the rights granted under this License;\n\n        ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\n         a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n         licensing scheme; and,\n\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether\n         individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\n         rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n    f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by\n     applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\n     or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\n     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\n     in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\n     Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\n     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will\n     waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by\n     the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\n      Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability.\n\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach\n     by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\n     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\n     provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n    b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\n     of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\n     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any\n     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\n     this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers\n     to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\n     to You under this License.\n\n    b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient\n     a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n     under this License.\n\n    c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall\n     not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless\n     such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\n     waiver or consent.\n\n    e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work\n     licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n     the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\n     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing\n     the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\n     (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of\n     1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect\n     in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\n     in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\n     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\n     license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

A work\n     that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above)\n     for the purposes of this License.\n\n    c.\"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or\n     Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n    d.\"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by\n     Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.\n\n    e.\"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work\n     under the terms of this License.\n\n    f.\"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals,\n     entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified,\n     the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians,\n     dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform\n     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the\n     producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or\n     other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n    g.\"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License\n     including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,\n     whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature;\n     a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show;\n     a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,\n     architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an\n     illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\n     architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data\n     to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus\n     performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n    h.\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously\n     violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\n     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n    i.\"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the\n     public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means\n     or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members\n     of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;\n     to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public\n     of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast\n     and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n    j.\"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by\n     sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,\n     including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n     medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights.\n\n Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant.\n\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    a.to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce\n     the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n    b.to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation\n     in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that\n     changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked\n     \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\n     \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n    c.to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n    d.to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions.\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must\n     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of\n     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work\n     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise\n     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense\n     the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures\n     on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\n     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work\n     as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work\n     itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice\n     from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n    b.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this\n     License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License;\n     (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n     3.0 US) (\"Applicable License\"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n     every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\n     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\n     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n     the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\n     Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included\n     in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform\n     the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that\n     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted\n     to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to\n     the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n     from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n    c.You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner\n     that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\n     compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\n     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial\n     advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\n     compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\n    d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,\n     You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\n     notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) \n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n     Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,\n     publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright\n     notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)\n     the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,\n     if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\n     the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),\n     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n     \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original\n     Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\n     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\n     minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\n     as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\n     above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert\n     or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\n     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    e.For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n        i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n         of the rights granted under this License;\n\n        ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\n         a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n         licensing scheme; and,\n\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether\n         individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\n         rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n\n    f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by\n     applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\n     or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\n     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\n     in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\n     Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\n     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will\n     waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by\n     the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\n      Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability.\n\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach\n     by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\n     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\n     provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n    b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\n     of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\n     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any\n     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\n     this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers\n     to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\n     to You under this License.\n\n    b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient\n     a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n     under this License.\n\n    c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall\n     not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless\n     such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\n     waiver or consent.\n\n    e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work\n     licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n     the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\n     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing\n     the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\n     (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of\n     1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect\n     in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\n     in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\n     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\n     license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.
