(ns lice-comb.matching
  "The core matching functionality within lice-comb. Matching is provided for
  three categories of input, and uses a different process for each:

  1. License names
  2. License uris
  3. License texts

  Each matching fn has two variants:

  1. A 'simple' version that returns a set of SPDX expressions (`String`s)
  2. An 'info' version that returns an 'expressions-info map' containing
     metadata on how the determination was made (including confidence
     information)

  An expressions-info map has this structure:
  
  * key:   an SPDX expression (`String`)
  * value: a sequence of 'expression-info' maps

  An expression-info map has this structure:
  
  * `:id` (`String`, optional):
    The portion of the SPDX expression that this info map refers to (usually,
    though not always, a single SPDX identifier).
  * `:type` (either `:declared` or `:concluded`, mandatory):
    Whether this identifier was unambiguously declared within the input or was
    instead concluded by lice-comb (see [the SPDX FAQ](https://wiki.spdx.org/view/SPDX_FAQ)
    for more detail on the definition of these two terms).
  * `:confidence` (one of: `:high`, `:medium`, `:low`, only provided when
    `:type` = `:concluded`):
    Indicates the approximate confidence lice-comb has in its conclusions for
    this particular SPDX identifier.
  * `:strategy` (a keyword, mandatory):
    The strategy lice-comb used to determine this particular SPDX identifier.
    See [[lice-comb.utils/strategy->string]] for an up-to-date list of all
    possible values.
  * `:source` (a sequence of `String`s):
    The list of sources used to arrive at this portion of the SPDX expression,
    starting from the most general (the input) through to the most specific
    (the smallest subset of the input that was used to make this
    determination)."

  2. Attempting to retrieve the plain text content of `uri` and if that succeeds
     running that text through [[text->expressions-info]]

  Notes on step 1:

  1. this does not perform exact matching; rather it simplifies URIs in various
     ways to avoid irrelevant differences, including performing a
     case-insensitive comparison, ignoring protocol differences (http vs https),
     ignoring extensions representing MIME types (.txt vs .html, etc.), etc.
  2. URIs in the SPDX license and exception lists are not unique - the same URI
     may represent multiple licenses and/or exceptions."
