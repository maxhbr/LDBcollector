      <h3>Upstream</h3>

      <p>
        upstream/jquery contains jquery by John Resig & The Dojo Foundation.
        Please see upstream/jquery/copyright.txt for their license details.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the files in upstream/plaintext are plaintext versions of
        licenses intended for free software, open source or free
        culture projects, obtained directly from their publishers and
        included without modifications. Similarly upstream/rdf
        contains metadata about licenses obtained directly from their
        publishers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of these licenses are not explicit about the terms which
        apply to the license text itself.  Our belief is that there is
        at least an implicit permission which allows distribution of
        verbatim copies of these licenses and their associated
        metadata.
