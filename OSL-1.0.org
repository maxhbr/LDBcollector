    Open Software License, v 1.0

    The Open Software License
    v. 1.0

    This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original
    work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
    has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
    notice for the Original Work: "Licensed under the Open Software
    License version 1.0"

    License Terms

    1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a
    world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable
    license to do the following:

    a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

    b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
    Original Work;

    c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works
    to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
    Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under the
    Open Software License;

    d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

    e) to display the Original Work publicly.

    2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license,
    under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are
    embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor ("Licensed
    Claims") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work.
    Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the Licensed Claims to
    make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works.

    3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
    preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
    all available documentation describing how to access and modify the
    Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable
    copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
    the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
    right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of
    the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
    permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as
    Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
    the address of that information repository in a notice immediately
    following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

    4) Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be
    deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
    secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
    expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use,
    sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the
    Licensed Claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the
    trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
    Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
    Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any
    Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

    5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use
    or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way
    such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be accessed or
    used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative
    Works are distributed to those persons, made available as an
    application intended for use over a computer network, or used to
    provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than
    You. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
    agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a
    distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this
    License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

    6) Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE
    COPYRIGHT IN AND TO THE ORIGINAL WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT
    THE ORIGINAL WORK IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A VALID CURRENT
    LICENSE FROM THE COPYRIGHT OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE
    IMMEDIATELY PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER
    THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF
    NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE
    OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF
    THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
    AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS
    GRANTED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    7) Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
    THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
    SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING
    AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
    COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
    DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    8) Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or
    another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You
    permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,
    and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or
    another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly
    prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other
    countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any
    of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate
    Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
    This license shall terminate immediately and you may no longer
    exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your
    failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

    9) Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
    to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging
    that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any
    license containing this "Mutual Termination for Patent Action" clause
    infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that software.

    10) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit
    arising under or relating to this License shall be maintained in the
    courts of the jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
    Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
    jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application
    of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work
    outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
    subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,
    17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and
    international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of
    this License.

    11) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License
    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
    limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
    connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
    section shall survive the termination of this License.

    12) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
    concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
    is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
    the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

    13) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
    License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
    legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the
    terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity
    that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.
    For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct
    or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
    whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
    (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
    of such entity.

    This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights
    reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this
    license without modification. This license may not be modified without
    the express written permission of its copyright owner.
