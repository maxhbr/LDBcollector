Upstream
========

upstream/jquery contains jquery by John Resig & The Dojo Foundation.
Please see upstream/jquery/copyright.txt for their license details.

All the files in upstream/plaintext are plaintext versions of licenses
intended for free software, open source or free culture projects,
obtained directly from their publishers and included without
modifications.  Similarly upstream/rdf contains metadata about
licenses obtained directoly from their publishers.

Most of these licenses are not explicit about the terms which apply to
the license text itself.  Our belief is that there is at least an
implicit permission which allows distribution of verbatim copies of
these licenses and their associated metadata.

for it to be removed from this project, please contact
