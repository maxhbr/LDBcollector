=== General Comments

* ``"DOM4J" is a registered trademark of MetaStuff, Ltd. Legitimate
credit can be found at "DOM4J Project http://www.dom4j.org/".'' (source:
https://github.com/Hitachi/open-license[Hitachi open-license]
(CDLA-Permissive-1.0))
* ``Per Fedora, this is an Apache 1.1 derived license. Unfortunately,
clause 4 is too broad, making it Free but GPL-incompatible. It does also
replace the deprecated keys classworlds and apache-due-credit that were
the same licenses. Plexus Classworlds was started in 2002 and dom4j in
2000/2001 hence it has precedence. Other projects such as
Exolab/Intalio/Castor and JCharts have used the same license. Castor is
actually the first to use this but dom4j is still commonly used and
castor less so. '' (source:
