3  DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License. 

3.3. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
(a) Third Party Claims.
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Contributor APIs.
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
(c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product. 

3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

3.8. Restrictions.

You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.
4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5  APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6  VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

6.1. New Versions.

Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License. 

6.3. Derivative Works.

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product. \n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

If You created one or more \r\n      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \r\n      Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \r\n      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights \r\n      relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, \r\n      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. \r\n      However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of \r\n      the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 \r\n      have been met for that Covered Code.

If You distribute the Executable version under \r\n      a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from \r\n      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \r\n      If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, \r\n      you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials \r\n      provided with the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by \r\n      the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. \r\n      In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled \r\n      for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8. Restrictions.\r\n\r\n      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels \r\n      from gSOAP.\r\n\r\n4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

You must \r\n      include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, \r\n      from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of \r\n      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in \r\n      an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or \r\n      ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n      (a) Third Party Claims.\r\n            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property \r\n            rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under \r\n            Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code \r\n            distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim \r\n            in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor \r\n            obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described \r\n            in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies \r\n            Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as \r\n            notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated \r\n            to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n      (b) Contributor APIs.\r\n            If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface \r\n            and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary \r\n            to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information \r\n            in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n      (c) Representations.\r\n            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, \r\n            Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's \r\n            original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant \r\n            the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not \r\n      possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, \r\n      then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) \r\n      where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more \r\n      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \r\n      Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \r\n      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights \r\n      relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, \r\n      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. \r\n      However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of \r\n      the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 \r\n      have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of \r\n      Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain \r\n      terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with \r\n      the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not \r\n      attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights \r\n      set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under \r\n      a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from \r\n      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \r\n      If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, \r\n      you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials \r\n      provided with the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by \r\n      the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. \r\n      In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled \r\n      for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8. Restrictions.\r\n\r\n      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels \r\n      from gSOAP.\r\n\r\n4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \r\n\r\n5  APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. \r\n\r\n6  VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\n      Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version \r\n      will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\n      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always \r\n      continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use \r\n      such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to \r\n      apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must \r\n      (a) rename Your license so that the phrase \"gSOAP\" or any confusingly similar phrase \r\n      do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) \r\n      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms \r\n      which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of \r\n      the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in \r\n      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF TRADE USAGE, CUSTOM, OR COURSE OF DEALING.

Application of License.\n\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n(a) Third Party Claims.\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n(b) Contributor APIs.\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n(c) Representations.\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product. \n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License. \n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase \"gSOAP\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License.
