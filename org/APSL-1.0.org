  1. General; Definitions.  This License applies to any program or other
    work which Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") publicly announces as
    subject to this Apple Public Source License and which contains a
    notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as "Original
    Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple
    Public Source License version 1.0 (or subsequent version thereof),
    as it may be revised from time to time by Apple ("License").  As

    grantor of rights, (i) patents or patent applications that are now
    or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) whose
    claims cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only
    to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the
    Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You
    are the grantor of rights, (i) patents and patent applications that
    are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii)
    whose claims cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone

    use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of
    Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.

    statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

  1.6 "Original Code" means the Source Code of a program or other work
    as originally made available by Apple under this License, including
    the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works
    made available by Apple under this License, and that has been
    expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such
    work.

  1.7 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other
    work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all
    modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
    scripts used to control compilation and installation of an
    executable (object code).

  1.8 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
    rights under this License.  For legal entities, "You" or "Your"
    includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under

    direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty
    percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial
    ownership of such entity.

  2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.  Subject to the terms
    and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective
    on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code,
    a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
    Apple's Applicable Patents and copyrights covering the Original
    Code, to do the following:

  2.1 You may use, copy, modify and distribute Original Code, with or
    without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and
    development, provided that You must in each instance:

  (a) retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright
  and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear
  in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code
  that refer to this License;

  (b) include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of
  Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer
  or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this
  License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
  Section 6; and

  (c) completely and accurately document all Modifications that you have
  made and the date of each such Modification, designate the version of
  the Original Code you used, prominently include a file carrying such
  information with the Modifications, and duplicate the notice in
  Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all such Modifications.

  2.2 You may Deploy Covered Code, provided that You must in each
    instance:

  (a) satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
  Source Code of the Covered Code;

  (b) make all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available in Source
  Code form via electronic distribution (e.g. download from a web site)
  under the terms of this License and subject to the license grants set
  forth in Section 3 below, and any additional terms You may choose to
  offer under Section 6.  You must continue to make the Source Code of
  Your Deployed Modifications available for as long as you Deploy the
  Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial
  Deployment, whichever is longer;

  (c) must notify Apple and other third parties of how to obtain Your
  Deployed Modifications by filling out and submitting the required
  information found at
  http://www.apple.com/publicsource/modifications.html; and

  (d) if you Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,
  include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related
  documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
  available under the terms of this License with information on how and
  where to obtain such Source Code.

  3. Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
    licenses granted to You under this License:

  (a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive,
  royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patents and other
  intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to use,
  reproduce, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the
  same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2;
  and

  (b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,
  worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your
  Applicable Patents and other intellectual property rights owned or
  controlled by You, to use, reproduce, execute, compile, display,
  perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries),
  sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through
  multiple tiers of distribution.

  4. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
    Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
    distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In each such
    instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
    fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

  5. Limitations on Patent License.  Except as expressly stated in
    Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted
    by Apple herein.  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require
    additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its
    sole discretion.

  6. Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or
    other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
    ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered
    Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your
    sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple. You must obtain the
    recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple
    harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against
    Apple by reason of any such Additional Terms.

  7. Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new
    versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be
    given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been
    published under a particular version of this License, You may
    continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
    choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent
    version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple
    has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
    under this License.

  8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Original Code may contain in whole or
    in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The
    Original Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss
    of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You
    expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or
    any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE ORIGINAL
    CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT
    OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF
    SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY
    REFERRED TO AS "APPLE") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR
    CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
    SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT
    THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR
    REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE
    UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE
    WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN
    BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A
    WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  You
    acknowledge that the Original Code is not intended for use in the
    operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
    systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure
    of the Original Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
    physical or environmental damage.

  9. Liability.

  9.1 Infringement.  If any of the Original Code becomes the subject of
    a claim of infringement ("Affected Original Code"), Apple may, at
    its sole discretion and option: (a) attempt to procure the rights
    necessary for You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b)
    modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer
    infringing; or (c) terminate Your rights to use the Affected
    Original Code, effective immediately upon Apple's posting of a
    notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for
    implementation of this License.

  9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
    UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
    PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
    THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.  In no event shall Apple's total
    liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the
    amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

  10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the
     trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X",
     "Mac OS X Server" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging
     to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") and no Apple Marks may be
     used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code
     other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
     with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are
     posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

  11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to
     the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of
     Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will
     not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its
     sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under
     this License, or on different terms from those contained in this
     License or may choose not to license them at all.  Apple's
     development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
     distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.

  12. Termination.

  12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
     terminate:

  (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
  any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
  days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of
  the circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or (c)
  automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
  term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
  against Apple.

  12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to
     immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and
     distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the
     case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of
     the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of
     termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or
     control.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been
     properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
     of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain
     in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,
     including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and
     13.  Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,
     indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
     this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
     License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
     either party.

  13.  Miscellaneous.

  13.1 Export Law Assurances.  You may not use or otherwise export or
     re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States
     law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was
     obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code
     may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or
     resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the
     U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals
     or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By
     using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not
     located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such
     country or on any such list.

  13.2 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
     defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data
     rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily
     provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary
     commercial license in technical data and software is provided in
     accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer
     Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR
     252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3
     (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
     Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire
     Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

  13.3 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as
     creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
     legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent
     to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
     otherwise.

  13.4 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair
     Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
     it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform
     the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
     Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
     develop, produce, market or distribute.

  13.5 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision
     of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
     of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which
     provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
     the drafter will not apply to this License.

  13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent
     jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion
     thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be
     enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the
     economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of
     this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or
     restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with
     Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of
     those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You
     must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and
     destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.

  13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution
     between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in
     the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby
     consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state
     and federal courts within that District with respect to this
     License. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
     excluded.

  13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the
     entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
     matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the
     United States and the State of California, except that body of
     California law concerning conflicts of law.

  Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
  clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
  that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
  parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
  connexes soient rediges en anglais.

You may also\n  choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent\n  version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple\n  has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\n  under this License.\n\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Original Code may contain in whole or\n  in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.

THE ORIGINAL\n  CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT\n  OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF\n  SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY\n  REFERRED TO AS \"APPLE\") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR\n  CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR\n  SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\n  NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT\n  THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR\n  REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE\n  UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE\n  WILL BE CORRECTED.

In no event shall Apple's total\n  liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the\n  amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n\n10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the\n   trademarks or trade names \"Apple\", \"Apple Computer\", \"Mac OS X\",\n   \"Mac OS X Server\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging\n   to Apple (collectively \"Apple Marks\") and no Apple Marks may be\n   used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code\n   other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times\n   with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are\n   posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n\n11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to\n   the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of\n   Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will\n   not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its\n   sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under\n   this License, or on different terms from those contained in this\n   License or may choose not to license them at all.  Apple's\n   development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and\n   distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.\n\n12. Termination.\n\n12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n   terminate:\n\n(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with\nany term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30\ndays of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of\nthe circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or (c)\nautomatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the\nterm of this License, commence an action for patent infringement\nagainst Apple.\n\n12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to\n   immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and\n   distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the\n   case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of\n   the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of\n   termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or\n   control.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been\n   properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination\n   of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain\n   in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n   including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and\n   13.  Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,\n   indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n   this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this\n   License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of\n   either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Export Law Assurances.  You may not use or otherwise export or\n   re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States\n   law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was\n   obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code\n   may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or\n   resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the\n   U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals\n   or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By\n   using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not\n   located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such\n   country or on any such list.\n\n13.2 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n   defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data\n   rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily\n   provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary\n   commercial license in technical data and software is provided in\n   accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer\n   Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR\n   252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3\n   (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software\n   Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire\n   Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n13.3 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as\n   creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of\n   legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent\n   to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or\n   otherwise.\n\n13.4 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair\n   Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for\n   it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform\n   the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,\n   Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may\n   develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n13.5 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\n   of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement\n   of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which\n   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\n   the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n   jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n   thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be\n   enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n   economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n   this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n   restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n   Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n   those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n   must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n   destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n   between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in\n   the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby\n   consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n   and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n   License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n   excluded.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\n   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n   matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n   United States and the State of California, except that body of\n   California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les\nparties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents\nconnexes soient rediges en anglais.\n\nEXHIBIT A. \n\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1999 Apple Computer, Inc.  All Rights\nReserved.

APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT\n  THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR\n  REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE\n  UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE\n  WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN\n  BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A\n  WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.

In no event shall Apple's total\n  liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the\n  amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n\n10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the\n   trademarks or trade names \"Apple\", \"Apple Computer\", \"Mac OS X\",\n   \"Mac OS X Server\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging\n   to Apple (collectively \"Apple Marks\") and no Apple Marks may be\n   used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code\n   other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times\n   with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are\n   posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n\n11. Ownership.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to\n   the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of\n   Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will\n   not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its\n   sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under\n   this License, or on different terms from those contained in this\n   License or may choose not to license them at all.  Apple's\n   development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and\n   distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.\n\n12. Termination.\n\n12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will\n   terminate:\n\n(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with\nany term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30\ndays of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of\nthe circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or (c)\nautomatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the\nterm of this License, commence an action for patent infringement\nagainst Apple.\n\n12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to\n   immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and\n   distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the\n   case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of\n   the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of\n   termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or\n   control.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been\n   properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination\n   of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain\n   in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n   including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and\n   13.  Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,\n   indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n   this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this\n   License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of\n   either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Export Law Assurances.  You may not use or otherwise export or\n   re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States\n   law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was\n   obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code\n   may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or\n   resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the\n   U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals\n   or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By\n   using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not\n   located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such\n   country or on any such list.\n\n13.2 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n   defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data\n   rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily\n   provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary\n   commercial license in technical data and software is provided in\n   accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer\n   Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR\n   252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3\n   (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software\n   Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire\n   Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n13.3 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as\n   creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of\n   legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent\n   to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or\n   otherwise.\n\n13.4 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair\n   Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for\n   it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform\n   the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,\n   Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may\n   develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n13.5 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\n   of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement\n   of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which\n   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\n   the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n   jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n   thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be\n   enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n   economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n   this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n   restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n   Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n   those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n   must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n   destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n   between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in\n   the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby\n   consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n   and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n   License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n   excluded.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\n   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n   matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n   United States and the State of California, except that body of\n   California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,\n   indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n   this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this\n   License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of\n   either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Export Law Assurances.  You may not use or otherwise export or\n   re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States\n   law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was\n   obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code\n   may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or\n   resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the\n   U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals\n   or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By\n   using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not\n   located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such\n   country or on any such list.\n\n13.2 Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n   defined in FAR 2.101.

Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire\n   Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n13.3 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as\n   creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of\n   legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent\n   to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or\n   otherwise.\n\n13.4 Independent Development.  Nothing in this License will impair\n   Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for\n   it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform\n   the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,\n   Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may\n   develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n13.5 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\n   of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement\n   of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which\n   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\n   the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n   jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n   thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be\n   enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n   economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n   this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n   restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n   Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n   those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n   must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n   destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n   between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in\n   the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby\n   consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n   and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n   License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n   excluded.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\n   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n   matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n   United States and the State of California, except that body of\n   California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English.
