- "The QPL is not GPL-compatible, which, regardless of one's opinion
  about the license's DFSG-freeness, poses a major practical problem for
  any code licensed under the QPL that is reused elsewhere in
  conjunction with code under the GNU GPL. This makes the QPL alone a
  particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is
  not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library
  and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license.
  Trolltech's website describes how their dual-license approach is
  intended to be "open source-friendly" (see
  http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that
  the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a
  dual-licensing policy?" (source:

This license covers modification and distribution of the Software, use of third-party application programs based on the Software, and development of free software which uses the Software.

  Granted Rights

  1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this license. Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of this license.

  2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer of the Software, is distributed.

  3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

      a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in the Software.

      b. When modifications to the Software are released under this license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of the initial developer.

  4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software, provided that you meet these restrictions:

      a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

      b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent notices in the distribution explaining this.

      c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this license.

  5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you or by others.

The recipients must be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.

      c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items, then you must supply one.

  Limitations of Liability
  In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides otherwise.

This makes the QPL alone a particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license. Trolltech's website describes how their dual-license approach is intended to be \"open source-friendly\" (see http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a dual-licensing policy?"
