#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Zimbra Public License, Version 1.3 (ZPL)

  This Zimbra Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
  describes the terms under which VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its
  principal place of business at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304
  ("VMware") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software").
  By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the
  terms of this Agreement.

  In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
  forth below, the parties agree as follows:

  1.	Grant of Copyright License

  1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby
  grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the
  Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy,
  modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the
  purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the
  Software made by You is a "Modification;" however, any file You add to the
  Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a "Modification."

  1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other
  entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having
  the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing
  copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered
  distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

  1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format,
  You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a
  complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any
  Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement
  will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with respect to
  the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this
  Agreement, You "stand in the shoes" of VMware in terms of the rights You grant
  and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your
  Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You "stand in the shoes" of
  VMware, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which
  requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of
  federal or state courts of northern California.

  1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object
  code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or
  Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement.
  The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code
  format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in
  compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make
  absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or
  Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by
  VMware, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising
  rights in the source code to the Software granted by VMware under this Agreement
  or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in
  Section 1.3.

  1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
  entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the
  Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.

  2.	Support

  VMware has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing
  in this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You for any
  other edition of the Software.

  3.	Intellectual Property Rights

  3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,
  no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to this
  Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
  All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly
  granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.

  3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
  retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
  notices that are included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the
  Software. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the form of
  trademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the Software.

  3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
  trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

  4.	Disclaimer of Warranties

  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. VMWARE MAKES
  NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO
  THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, VMWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
  ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
  ALLOWED BY LAW, VMWARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF VMWARE HAD BEEN
  INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY
  MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.

  5.	Limitation of Liability

  IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
  EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
  LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF
  COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING,
  PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,
  WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  6.	Term and Termination

  6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated earlier
  pursuant to this Section 6.

  6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement, VMware may terminate
  this Agreement.

  6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
  this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies
  available to VMware at law or equity or under this Agreement.

  6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
  reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting VMware's
  liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section
  7), which provisions will survive termination of this Agreement.

  7.	Miscellaneous

  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
  subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications,
  representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between
  the parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the parties
  hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be
  construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
  legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or provision in
  this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent,
  this Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates the
  intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be
  severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue
  to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This
  Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the
  State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict
  of law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
  of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this
  Agreement involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the
  jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with venue
  lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
  obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You,
  in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way
  of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of
  VMware, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such
  consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement
  or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be
  effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of
  this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed or
  be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this Agreement and will
  not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or
  prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.

For the\npurposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the\nSoftware made by You is a \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the\nSoftware that does not contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\"\n\n1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other\nentity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having\nthe authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing\ncopies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered\ndistribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format,\nYou must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a\ncomplete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any\nModification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement\nwill apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with respect to\nthe Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this\nAgreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of VMware in terms of the rights You grant\nand how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your\nModifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of\nVMware, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which\nrequires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of\nfederal or state courts of northern California.\n\n1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object\ncode format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or\nModification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement.\nThe distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code\nformat may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make\nabsolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\nModification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by\nVMware, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising\nrights in the source code to the Software granted by VMware under this Agreement\nor rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in\nSection 1.3.\n\n1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are\nentirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the\nSoftware and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n2.\tSupport\n\nVMware has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing\nin this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You for any\nother edition of the Software.\n\n3.\tIntellectual Property Rights\n\n3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1,\nno rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to this\nAgreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.\nAll rights, including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly\ngranted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.\n\n3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must\nretain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\nnotices that are included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the\nSoftware. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the form of\ntrademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the Software.\n\n3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or\ntrademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.\n\n4.\tDisclaimer of Warranties\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
