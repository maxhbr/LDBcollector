** Text
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Preamble

  The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
  be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
  control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
  package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
  fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

  Definitions:

  "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
  and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
  been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
  package.

  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
  duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
  required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
  community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
  there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
  of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

  1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
  Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
  the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

  2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
  from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
  a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

  3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
  you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
  changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
  Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
  medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
  or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
  Standard Version of the Package.

  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
  standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
  page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from
  the Standard Version.

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

  4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
  form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
  with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
  Standard Version.

  b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
  with your modifications.

  c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
  Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
  clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
  with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

  5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
  charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
  in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
  (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
  this Package as a product of your own.

  6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
  the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
  this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
  commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

  7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
  be considered part of this Package.

  8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

  9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. \n\nWith this clause present, it is called the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-Perl-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.\n\nOne such example is the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0. \n\n\n\nThe Artistic License\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n\n7.

(You will not be\nrequired to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing\ncommunity at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though\nthere may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients\nof the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard\nVersion of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of\nthe original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived\nfrom the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such\na way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that\nyou insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you\nchanged that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely\nAvailable, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent\nmedium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,\nor by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the\nStandard Version of the Package.\n\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with\nstandard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual\npage for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from\nthe Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable\nform, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together\nwith instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the\nStandard Version.\n\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package\nwith your modifications.\n\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard\nVersion executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and\nclearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\nwith instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.\nYou may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not\ncharge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package\nin aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger\n(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise\nthis Package as a product of your own.\n\n6.
