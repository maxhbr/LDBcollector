** General Comments

- "In addition to the requirements of strong copyleft licenses, network
  copyleft licenses require you to share larger programs that you build
  with the licensed software not just when you give copies to others,
  but also when you run the software for others to use over the Internet
  or another network." (source:
  [[https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft][BlueOak License List]]
  ([[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueoakcouncil/blue-oak-list-npm-package/master/LICENSE][CC0-1.0]]))

- "Strong copyleft licenses require you to share both the licensed
  software (like the weak copyleft licenses, and larger programs that
  you build with the licensed software, when you give copies to others."
