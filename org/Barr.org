#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  This is a package of commutative diagram macros built on top of Xy-pic  by
  Michael Barr (email: barr@barrs.org). Its use is unrestricted. It  may be freely
  distributed, unchanged, for non-commercial or commercial  use. If changed, it
  must be renamed. Inclusion in a commercial  software package is also permitted,
  but I would appreciate receiving a  free copy for my personal examination and
  use. There are no guarantees  that this package is good for anything. I have
  tested it with LaTeX 2e,  LaTeX 2.09 and Plain TeX. Although I know of no reason
  it will not work  with AMSTeX, I have not tested it.
