  1. General; Definitions. This License applies only to the following 
  software programs: the open source versions of Sybase's Watcom C/C++ and 
  Fortran compiler products ("Software"), which are modified versions of, 
  with significant changes from, the last versions made commercially 
  available by Sybase. As used in this License:

  grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter 
  acquired, owned by or assigned to Sybase and (ii) that cover subject matter 
  contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, 
  reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) 
  in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that 
  are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that 
  cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination 
  with Original Code.

  1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to 
  the creation of Modifications.

  1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination

  Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of 
  Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.

  the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous 
  Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous 
  Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is

  and/or (b) 
  any new file or other representation of computer program statements that 
  contains any part of Covered Code.

  1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work

  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to 
  control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).

   cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
  otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

  2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and 
  conditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the 
  date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, 
  royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Sybase's Applicable 
  Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the 
  following:

  2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute 
  Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal 
  research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each 
  instance:
  (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the 
  copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as they 
  appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original 
  Code that refer to this License; and
  (b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy 
  of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You 
  may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or 
  restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as 
  permitted under Section 6.
  (c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this 
  License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance by 
  clicking on an "I accept" button or similar mechanism. If a click-wrap 
  format is not included, you must include a statement that any use 
  (including without limitation reproduction, modification or distribution) 
  of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes 
  acceptance of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered 
  Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms and 
  conditions of the License.

  2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, 
  provided that in each instance:
  (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the 
  Source Code of the Covered Code;
  (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice 
  in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and 
  cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
  changed the files and the date of any change;
  (c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly 
  available under the terms of this License, including the license grants 
  set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code 
  or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is 
  longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed 
  Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site);
  (d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You 
  must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related 
  documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available 
  under the terms of this License with information on how and where to 
  obtain such Source Code; and
  (e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your 
  own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains terms 
  no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms of this 
  License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this License 
  are offered by You alone and not by any other party.

  2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each 
  Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered 
  Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any 
  Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other 
  intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each 
  Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other 
  entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. 
  As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
  You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent 
  license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is 
  Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered 
  Code.

  3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses 
  granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all 
  third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable 
  Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) 
  owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, 
  distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as 
  Sybase's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

  4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
  with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
  the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make 
  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code 
  or any portion thereof.

  5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, 
  no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. 
  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses 
  from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion.

  6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, 
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights 
  consistent with this License ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients 
  of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as 
  Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. 
  You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms 
  are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and 
  hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by 
  or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any 
  such Additional Terms.

  7. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions 
  of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
  distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under 
  a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the 
  terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under 
  the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No 
  one other than Sybase has the right to modify the terms applicable to 
  Covered Code created under this License.

  8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part 
  pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may 
  contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be 
  incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that 
  use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire 
  risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES 
  OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND SYBASE AND SYBASE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY 
  REFERRED TO AS "SYBASE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL 
  CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR 
  CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A 
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT 
  OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT 
  AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE 
  FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT 
  THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR 
  THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
  INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE 
  OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the 
  Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, 
  aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control 
  machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death,
   personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO 
  EVENT SHALL SYBASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
  SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT 
  OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED 
  CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, 
  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF 
  SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
  DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. 
  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL 
  OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT 
  APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase's or any Contributor's total 
  liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by 
  applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five hundred 
  dollars ($500.00).

  10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the 
  trademarks or trade names "Sybase" or any other trademarks or trade names 
  belonging to Sybase (collectively "Sybase Marks") or to any trademark or 
  trade name belonging to any Contributor("Contributor Marks"). No Sybase 
  Marks or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products 
  derived from the Original Code or Covered Code other than with the prior 
  written consent of Sybase or the Contributor, as applicable.

  11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor 
  retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such 
  Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the 
  Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase ("Sybase 
  Modifications"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically 
  subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to 
  license such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms 
  from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at 
  all.

  12. Termination.

  12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
  terminate:
  (a) automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of 
  this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
  aware of such breach;
  (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 
  13.5(b); or
  (c) automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of 
  this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as a 
  cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor.

  12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately 
  stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and 
  distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered 
  Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered 
  Code that have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any 
  termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should 
  remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, 
  including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No 
  party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages 
  of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance 
  with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice 
  to any other right or remedy of any party.

  13. Miscellaneous.

  13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as 
  defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the 
  Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public 
  as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical 
  data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical 
  Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense 
  purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 
  227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software 
  Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
  Code with only those rights set forth herein.

  13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as 
  creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal 
  association between or among you, Sybase or any Contributor, and You will 
  not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, 
  appearance or otherwise.

  13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase's 
  or any Contributor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop 
  for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the 
  same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, 
  Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market 
  or distribute.

  13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce 
  any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future 
  enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which 
  provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the 
  drafter will not apply to this License.

  13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction 
  finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be 
  unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum 
  extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the 
  parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and 
  effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or 
  restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 
  and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this 
  License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any 
  use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your 
  possession or control.

  13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between 
  You and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern 
  District of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal 
  jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that 
  District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations 
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
  excluded.

  13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire 
  agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 
  This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the 
  State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts 
  of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following 
  clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this 
  License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont 
  exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges 
  en anglais.
