- *↓*"Google Classification is CANNOT_BE_USED "Code released under the
  Sybase Open Watcom Public License version 1.0 cannot be used at
  Google. Provision 12.1\169 terminates the license if any patent
  litigation is filed against Sybase or any contributor, including cross
  claims and counterclaims, without limiting the scope of this provision
  to patent litigation concerning the specific software being licensed.
  This provision goes too far in restricting the exercise of
  Google\8217s patent rights and is therefore prohibited at Google.""
