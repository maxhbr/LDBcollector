** General Comments

- "category: diffmark" (source:

  Universe]] (CC-BY-4.0))

- "Per Fedora, this extremely minimal and permissive license was found
  in diffmark (0.08). While poorly written, our interpretation of the
  text permits use, modification, and distribution. It also permits
  wearing it as a hat or eating it for lunch, although neither of those
  cases are recommended. This would perhaps be considered Copyright
  only, except that no requirement of retention of copyright is present,
  and the copyright holder is disclaiming liability (albeit, poorly).
  This license is Free, and GPL compatible. " (source:
