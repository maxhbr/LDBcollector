** General Comments

- "Per Fedora, the Trusster Open Source License (TOSL) is a derivation
  of the Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where
  the Sleepycat License says The source code must either be included in
  the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of
  distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable
  under reasonable conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source
  code must either be included in the distribution or be available in a
  timely fashion for no more than the cost of distribution plus a
  nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable and
  no more restrictive conditions. While the Sleepycat License is
  considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license, TOSL is
  GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the "no more restrictive"
  language. " (source:
