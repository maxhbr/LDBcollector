  Version 1.2 - January 4, 2001

  Please read this License carefully before downloading this software.
  By downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by
  the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms
  of this License, please do not download or use the software.

  1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other
  work which Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and
  which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or
  work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of
  this Apple Public Source License version 1.2 (or subsequent version
  thereof) ("License"). As used in this License:

  1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is
  the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
  acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject
  matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent
  necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code
  without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of
  rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,
  owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your
  Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.

  1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or
  contributes to the creation of Modifications.

  1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the
  combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any
  respective portions thereof.

  1.4 "Deploy" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other
  than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or
  Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal
  use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business or
  organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as
  direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You
  to any third party in any form or manner.

  1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions
  thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

  1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change
  to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous
  Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous
  Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is
  released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to
  or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code;
  and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
  statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

  1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other
  work as originally made available by Apple under this License,
  including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs
  or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been
  expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such
  work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and
  originally made available by Apple under this License.

  1.8 "Personal Use" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely
  for his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An
  individual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer,
  employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a corporation,
  business or organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not
  qualify as Personal Use.

  1.9 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other
  work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all
  modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
  scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable
  (object code).

  1.10 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
  rights under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your"
  includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under
  common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct
  or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
  whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent
  (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
  such entity.

  2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms
  and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on
  the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a
  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
  Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original
  Code, to do the following:

  2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute
  Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal
  research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each
  instance:

  (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
  copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as
  they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
  Original Code that refer to this License; and

  (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source
  Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not
  offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict
  this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted
  under Section 6.

  2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy
  Covered Code, provided that in each instance:

  (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to
  the Source Code of the Covered Code;

  (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
  notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
  Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;

  (c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications
  publicly available under the terms of this License, including the
  license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy
  the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial
  Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the
  Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g.
  download from a web site); and

  (d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,
  You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in
  related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
  available under the terms of this License with information on how and
  where to obtain such Source Code.

  2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each
  Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
  Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or
  any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or
  other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each
  Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any
  other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
  otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
  granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any
  other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
  third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the
  Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before
  distributing the Covered Code.

  3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
  licenses granted to You under this License:

  (a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive,
  royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other
  intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled
  by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and
  Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's
  licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

  (b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,
  worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your
  Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other
  than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display,
  perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries),
  sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through
  multiple tiers of distribution.

  4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,
  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
  the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

  5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in
  Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by
  Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional
  patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole
  discretion.

  6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other
  rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
  ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
  responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You
  must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms
  are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
  and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by
  reason of any such Additional Terms.

  7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new
  versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
  a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
  under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it
  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
  Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
  License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to
  modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
  License.

  8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
  part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
  Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and
  may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
  and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
  Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
  WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND
  APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE
  PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
  ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
  NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
  PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
  INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
  FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
  THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
  ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
  ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE
  AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the
  operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
  systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of
  the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
  physical or environmental damage.

  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
  EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
  SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
  TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR
  ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
  APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
  REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
  TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
  damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
  License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

  10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the
  trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac
  OS X Server", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other
  trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple
  Marks") or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any
  Contributor. No Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products
  derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in
  strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark
  usage guidelines which are posted at
  http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

  11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
  each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
  Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights,
  title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
  made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple
  Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple
  may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple
  Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
  contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

  12. Termination.

  12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate:

  (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
  any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
  days of becoming aware of such breach;

  (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
  13.5(b); or

  (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
  the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
  against Apple.

  12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
  stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
  distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the
  Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses
  to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to
  termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
  which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination
  of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections
  3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other
  for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result
  of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and
  termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other
  right or remedy of any party.

  13. Miscellaneous.

  13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
  defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in
  the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the
  public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license
  in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
  12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
  Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
  Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
  Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S.
  Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
  forth herein.

  13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as
  creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
  legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and
  You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
  implication, appearance or otherwise.

  13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
  Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
  it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
  same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
  Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
  develop, produce, market or distribute.

  13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to
  enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
  future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
  construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.

  13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent
  jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
  to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
  the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
  and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
  continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
  if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
  specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
  enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
  immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
  the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
  possession or control.

  13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution
  between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
  Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
  the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
  courts within that District with respect to this License. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

  13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the
  entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
  matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
  United States and the State of California, except that body of
  California law concerning conflicts of law.

  Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
  clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
  that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
  parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
  connexes soient rediges en anglais.
