  The OpenLDAP Public License 

  Version 1.1, 25 August 1998 
  Copyright 1998, The OpenLDAP Foundation. 
  All Rights Reserved. 

  Note: 
  This license is derived from the "Artistic License" as distributed 
  with the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from 
  those of the "Artistic License." 

  PREAMBLE 

  The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a 
  Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some 
  semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, 
  while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute 
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make 
  reasonable modifications. 

  Definitions: 

  "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
  Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files 
  created through textual modification. 

  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been 
  modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes 
  of the Copyright Holder. 

  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or 
  copyrights for the package. 

  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing 
  this Package. 

  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the 
  basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, 
  and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the 
  Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large 
  as a market that must bear the fee.) 

  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item 
  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. 
  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it 
  under the same conditions they received it. 

  1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
  Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 

  2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications 
  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package 
  modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 

  3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and 
  when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the 
  following: 

  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
  Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or 
  an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive 
  site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include 
  your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. 

  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 

  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict 
  with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide 
  a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly 
  documents how it differs from the Standard Version. 

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

  4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or 
  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where 
  to get the Standard Version. 

  b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of 
  the Package with your modifications. 

  c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding 
  Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables 
  non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual 
  pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get 
  the Standard Version. 

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

  5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
  Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. 
  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, 
  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly 
  commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software 
  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a 
  product of your own. 

  6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as 
  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall 
  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated 
  them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this 
  Package. 

  7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order 
  to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this 
  Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the 
  equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do 
  not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the 
  regression tests for the language. 

  8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 

  9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR 
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED 
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
