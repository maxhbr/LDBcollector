** Description

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A permissive license lets people do anything with your code with
  proper attribution and without warranty. The ISC license is
  functionally equivalent to the <a href="/licenses/bsd-2-clause/">BSD
  2-Clause</a> and <a href="/licenses/mit/">MIT</a> licenses, removing
  some language that is no longer necessary.
