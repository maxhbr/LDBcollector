  Yahoo! Public License, Version 1.0 (YPL)

  This Yahoo! Public License (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement that
  describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its
  principal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089
  ("Yahoo!") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ("Software").
  By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ("You") agree to the
  terms of this Agreement.

  In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set
  forth below, the parties agree as follows:

     1. Grant of Copyright License

            * 1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo!
            hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in
            and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable
            license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software
            and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
            addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
            "Modification;" however, any file You add to the Software that does
            not contain any part of the Software is not a "Modification."

            * 1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or
            other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject
            to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to
            this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or
            entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.

            * 1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source
            code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement,
            and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your
            distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in
            source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in
            the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software.
            In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this
            Agreement, You "stand in the shoes" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights
            You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the
            licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when
            You "stand in the shoes" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the
            jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes
            under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or
            state courts of northern California.

            * 1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in
            compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with
            access to the Software or Modification in source code format along
            with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the
            Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be
            under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance
            with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make
            absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or
            Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone
            and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients
            from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by
            Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any
            Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.

            * 1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files
            that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any
            portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You
            choose.

     2. Support

            * Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to
            You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any
            license with You for any other edition of the Software.

     3. Intellectual Property Rights

            * 3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in
            Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may
            arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication,
            exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all
            intellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under
            this Agreement are hereby reserved.

            * 3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create,
            You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent,
            trademark, and attribution notices that are included in the Software
            in the same form as they appear in the Software. This includes the
            preservation of attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos
            that exist within a user interface of the Software.

            * 3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's
            name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with
            Section 3.2.

     4. Disclaimer of Warranties

            * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
            YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY
            REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT
            WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN
            UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO!
            SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF
            SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY
            MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.

     5. Limitation of Liability

            * IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
            INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
            (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
            INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR
            ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF
            THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS
            A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND
            EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     6. Term and Termination

            * 6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until
            terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.

            * 6.2 - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this
            Agreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.

            * 6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the
            termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any
            rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this
            Agreement.

            * 6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions
            regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming
            or limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination
            (Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will
            survive termination of this Agreement.

     7. Miscellaneous

            * This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with
            respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all
            previous communications, representations, understandings and
            agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect
            to said subject matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is
            that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be
            construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any
            other form of legal association between the parties. If any term,
            condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid,
            unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be
            construed in a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this
            Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed
            from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will
            continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
            by law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance
            with the laws of the State of California and the United States of
            America, without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N.
            Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not
            apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement
            involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the
            jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California,
            with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be
            assigned, no obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not
            be transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by
            operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or
            consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any
            purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent
            shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this
            Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must
            be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to
            enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at
            any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such
            party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the
            validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such
            party's right to take subsequent action.

Inc., a Delaware corporation having its\nprincipal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089\n(\"Yahoo!\") will provide software to you via download or otherwise (\"Software\").\nBy using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the\nterms of this Agreement.\n\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set\nforth below, the parties agree as follows:\n\n   1. Grant of Copyright License\n\n          * 1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo!\n          hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in\n          and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable\n          license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software\n          and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,\n          addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a\n          \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software that does\n          not contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\"\n\n          * 1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or\n          other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject\n          to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to\n          this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or\n          entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n          * 1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source\n          code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement,\n          and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your\n          distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in\n          source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in\n          the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software.\n          In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this\n          Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights\n          You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the\n          licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when\n          You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the\n          jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes\n          under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or\n          state courts of northern California.\n\n          * 1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n          compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with\n          access to the Software or Modification in source code format along\n          with a complete copy of this Agreement.

In addition, You must make\n          absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\n          Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone\n          and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients\n          from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by\n          Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any\n          Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.\n\n          * 1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files\n          that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any\n          portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You\n          choose.\n\n   2. Support\n\n          * Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to\n          You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any\n          license with You for any other edition of the Software.\n\n   3.

This includes the\n          preservation of attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos\n          that exist within a user interface of the Software.\n\n          * 3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's\n          name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with\n          Section 3.2.\n\n   4.

Limitation of Liability\n\n          * IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND\n          (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS\n          INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR\n          ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF\n          THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS\n          A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND\n          EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   6. Term and Termination\n\n          * 6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until\n          terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\n\n          * 6.2 - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this\n          Agreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.\n\n          * 6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the\n          termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any\n          rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this\n          Agreement.\n\n          * 6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions\n          regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming\n          or limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination\n          (Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will\n          survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n   7. Miscellaneous\n\n          * This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with\n          respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all\n          previous communications, representations, understandings and\n          agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect\n          to said subject matter.
