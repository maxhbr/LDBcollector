  ANTLR 2 License

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR --it is fully in the public domain. An
  individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed
  with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR,
  or its output, into commerical software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that
  credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use
  ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial
  product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact
  somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and
  have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it
  using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source
  code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
  system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

  In countries where the Public Domain status of the work may not be valid, the
  author grants a copyright licence to the general public to deal in the work
  without restriction and permission to sublicence derivates under the terms of
