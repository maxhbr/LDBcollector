  making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus
  any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source

  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
  claims:

      distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without

  (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
      Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
      Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that

      the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
      extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
      combinations. 

  2.2. Contributor Grant.
  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
  claims:

  (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
      distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
      portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
      Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and 

  (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,
      to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but
      solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary
      to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
      thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to
      Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 

  3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License.
  The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of
  this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
  Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
  of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with
  every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
  impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
  the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
  hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
  the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 

  3.2. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source
  Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
  an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
  and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
  remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
  initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
  subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
  available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
  the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications.
  You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
  file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
  the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
  the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
  Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
  Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

  (a) Third Party Claims.
      If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
      right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
      under this License), you must include a text file with the source
      code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
      the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
      will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
      make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
      shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
      available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
      appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
      inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
      been obtained. 

  (b) Contributor APIs.
      If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
      You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
      implement that API, you must also include this information in the
      LEGAL file. 

  3.5. Required Notices.
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
  Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
  You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
  created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
  Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not
  possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
  its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
  as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
  such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
  recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
  behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
  and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
  such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
  and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
  the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
  obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
  in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
  collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
  Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
  Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
  from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
  of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
  not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source
  Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must
  make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
  are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
  or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute
  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
  to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
  the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
  file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
  distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
  statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
  for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

  5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
  attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER

  or any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor
  indirect).

  10. MISCELLANEOUS

  matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be construed by and in accordance with
