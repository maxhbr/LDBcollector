  CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive


  Preamble

  CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
  hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
  freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
  and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
  Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P
  (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN- OHL-W (weakly
  reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

  The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
  unmodified form only.

  Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
  Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
  their development.


  1 Definitions

    1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-P.

    1.2 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital
        code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to
        prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its
        medium or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.

    1.3 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
        under this Licence.

    1.4 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
        whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
        application or processing of Covered Source.

    1.5 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by
       manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered
       Source or another Product or otherwise.

    1.6 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,
        references to the location of any Notices, modification notices
        (subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence
        and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the
        Covered Source.

    1.7 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under
        this Licence.

    1.8 'Licensor' means a person who creates Source or modifies Covered
        Source and subsequently Conveys the resulting Covered Source
        under the terms and conditions of this Licence. A person may be
        a Licensee and a Licensor at the same time.

    1.9 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.


  2 Applicability

    2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying
        of Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By
        exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably
        accept these terms and conditions.

    2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and
        shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.

    2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the
        rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.

    2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing,
        or any other similar right.


  3 Copying, modifying and Conveying Covered Source

    3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in
        any medium, provided You retain all Notices.

    3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices.

        You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to
        the corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may
        add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.

    3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You
        shall also become a Licensor) provided that You:

         a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2; and

         b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You
            have modified it, with the date and brief description of how
            You have modified it.

    3.4 You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source under
        licence terms which differ from the terms of this Licence
        provided that:

         a) You comply at all times with subsection 3.3; and

         b) You provide a copy of this Licence to anyone to whom You
            Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source.


  4 Making and Conveying Products

  You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You ensure
  that the recipient of the Product has access to any Notices applicable
  to the Product.


  5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

    5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products
        are provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties,
        including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
        merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of
        third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use
        are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the
        maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no
        representation that any Source or Product does not or will not
        infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other
        proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and
        performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not
        the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part
        of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights
        granted under this Licence.

    5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to
        the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for
        direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
        punitive or other damages of any character including, without
        limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of
        use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused
        and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including
        negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way
        in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source
        and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of
        the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the
        Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,
        damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,
        in relation to such use.


  6 Patents

    6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each
        Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
        stated in this section 6, or where terminated by the Licensor
        for cause) patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to
        sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source
        and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent
        claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily
        infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as
        Conveyed by that Licensor.

    6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
        a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
        Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory
        patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent
        licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable
        then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall
        terminate as of the date such process is initiated.


  7 General

    7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become
        invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
        provisions shall remain effective.

    7.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and
        abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is
        known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where
        the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use
        shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind
        of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or
        its personnel.

    7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence
        which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New
        versions will be published with a unique version number and a
        variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has
        specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source
        without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source
        as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that
        variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be
        treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may
        also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific
        version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You
        may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same
        variant identifier published by CERN.

    7.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor
        acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are
        specifically excluded.

The Licensor makes no\n      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not\n      infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other\n      proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and\n      performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not\n      the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part\n      of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights\n      granted under this Licence.\n\n  5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to\n      the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for\n      direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,\n      punitive or other damages of any character including, without\n      limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of\n      use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused\n      and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including\n      negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way\n      in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\n      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of\n      the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the\n      Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,\n      damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,\n      in relation to such use.\n\n\n6 Patents\n\n  6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each\n      Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,\n      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as\n      stated in this section 6, or where terminated by the Licensor\n      for cause) patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to\n      sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source\n      and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent\n      claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily\n      infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as\n      Conveyed by that Licensor.\n\n  6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including\n      a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n      Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory\n      patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent\n      licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable\n      then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall\n      terminate as of the date such process is initiated.\n\n\n7 General\n\n  7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become\n      invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining\n      provisions shall remain effective.\n\n  7.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\n      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is\n      known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where\n      the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use\n      shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind\n      of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or\n      its personnel.\n\n  7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence\n      which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may\n      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New\n      versions will be published with a unique version number and a\n      variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has\n      specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source\n      without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source\n      as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\n      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be\n      treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may\n      also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific\n      version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You\n      may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same\n      variant identifier published by CERN.\n\n  7.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor\n      acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are\n      specifically excluded.\n",
