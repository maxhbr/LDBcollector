  Secure Messaging Protocol (SMP) Public License

  The United States Government/Department of Defense/National Security Agency/Office of Network Security (collectively "the U.S. Government") hereby grants permission to any person obtaining a copy of the SMP source and object files (the "SMP Software") and associated documentation files (the "SMP Documentation"), or any portions thereof, to do the following, subject to the following license conditions:

  You may, free of charge and without additional permission from the U.S. Government, use, copy, modify, sublicense and otherwise distribute the SMP Software or components of the SMP Software, with or without modifications developed by you and/or by others.

  You may, free of charge and without additional permission from the U.S. Government, distribute copies of the SMP Documentation, with or without modifications developed by you and/or by others, at no charge or at a charge that covers the cost of reproducing such copies, provided that this SMP Public License is retained.

  Furthermore, if you distribute the SMP Software or parts of the SMP Software, with or without modifications developed by you and/or others, then you must either make available the source code to all portions of the SMP Software (exclusive of any modifications made by you and/or by others) upon request, or instead you may notify anyone requesting the SMP Software source code that it is freely available from the U.S. Government.

  Transmission of this SMP Public License must accompany whatever portions of the SMP Software you redistribute.

  The SMP Software is provided without warranty or guarantee of any nature, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

  The U.S. Government cannot be held liable for any damages either directly or indirectly caused by the use of the SMP Software.

  It is not permitted to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer any of the SMP Software except as expressly indicated herein. Any attempts to do otherwise will be considered a violation of this License and your rights to the SMP Software will be voided.

  The SMP uses the Enhanced SNACC (eSNACC) Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) C++ Library to ASN.1 encode and decode security-related data objects. The eSNACC ASN.1 C++ Library is covered by the ENHANCED SNACC SOFTWARE PUBLIC LICENSE. None of the GNU public licenses apply to the eSNACC ASN.1 C++ Library. The eSNACC Compiler is not distributed as part of the SMP.
