  Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License

  Version 1.1

  PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE
  ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER
  ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("LICENSE"). ANY USE,
  REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
  THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

  License Background

  Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We
  believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate
  software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and
  innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we
  are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.

  This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the
  Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and
  without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
  Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined
  below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to
  permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License
  unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program
  must be distributed under the terms of this License.

  The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under
  which you may use the Program.

  1. DEFINITIONS

  1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and
  (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and
  additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the
  Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
  Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates
  from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
  itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do
  not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of
  software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
  license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

  1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes
  the Program.

  1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the
  Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any
  Contributions made to the Program thereafter.

  1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions
  thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

  1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are
  infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
  with the Program.

  1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which
  this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code,
  object code and documentation, if any.

  1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

  1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the
  Program.

  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
  to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
  perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1
  shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

  2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
  to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell,
  offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
  in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section
  2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
  if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
  addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
  by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is
  granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not
  include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance
  with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
  modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of
  Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except
  as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with
  respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
  Contributions made by that Contributor.

  2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in
  Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the
  Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
  rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
  liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity
  based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
  condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
  Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
  intellectual property rights needed, if any.

  2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,
  title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the
  right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

  3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

  3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent
  notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related
  documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available
  from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the
  source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in
  object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

  a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and 
  b. its license agreement: 
  	i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
  	conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
  	and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
  	merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent
  	permitted by applicable law;
  	ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
  	damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
  	damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
  	law; 
  	iii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are
  	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
  	iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such 
  	Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain
  	it in a reasonable manner.

  3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a. it must be made available under this License; and 
  b. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

  3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution
  of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge
  Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.
  Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license
  fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights
  under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source
  code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if
  any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and
  distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
  Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a
  Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an
  attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties
  or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

  3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with
  other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the
  Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a
  commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may
  subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual
  commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and
  non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No
  Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.
  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
  offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to
  defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)
  who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial
  Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)
  arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
  party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
  acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of
  such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
  Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
  Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
  infringement.

  3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys
  intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
  by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)
  include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
  ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates
  International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York
  11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both
  describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
  that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such
  matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is
  made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES
  file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
  other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
  reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such
  new knowledge has been obtained.

  3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other
  Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the
  Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any
  documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4,
  each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

  4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

  4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor
  provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the
  Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of
  any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement
  that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the
  Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the
  prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the
  Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
  related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or
  ownership of the Program.

  5. NO WARRANTY

  5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS
  PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY,
  REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY,
  PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY
  CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS,
  UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
  PERMITTED BY LAW.

  5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
  risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License,
  including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
  compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
  equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

  5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use
  in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation,
  communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the
  failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
  physical or environmental damage.

  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

  6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT
  PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
  DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
  ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
  USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
  HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

  7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any
  rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted
  at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service
  marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or
  to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any
  Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of
  the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or
  promote products derived from the Original Program.

  7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under
  trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided
  that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program.

  8. PATENT LITIGATION

  8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or
  entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
  other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then
  such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of
  the date such litigation is filed.

  9. OWNERSHIP

  9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1
  and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest
  in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all
  rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any
  Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA
  Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may,
  at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under
  this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License
  or may choose not to license them at all.

  10. TERMINATION

  10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it
  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
  License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
  after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under
  this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
  of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients
  obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as
  a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
  termination.

  11. GENERAL

  11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
  the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
  by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
  extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License
  from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a
  distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
  always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which
  it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is
  published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
  its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the
  right to modify this License.

  11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms
  of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply
  with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be
  included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to
  the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.

  11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No
  Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one
  year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights
  to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other
  dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License
  shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby
  consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and
  federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

  11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the
  following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have
  requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in
  English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu'elles ont exige que le
  present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en
  anglais.

  11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions
  and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program.
  Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that
  Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation
  of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary
  licenses and authorizations.

  11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
  with respect to the subject matter hereof.

It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a\nContributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a\nContributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an\nattempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties\nor other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with\nother software code not governed by the terms of this License, and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the\nContributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may\nsubject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual\ncommitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and\nnon-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No\nContributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.\nTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to\ndefend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)\nwho made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial\nContributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)\narising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or\nLosses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement.\n\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted\nby such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)\ninclude a text file with the Program source code distribution titled\n../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates\nInternational, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York\n11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both\ndescribing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\nthat a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such\nmatter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is\nmade available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES\nfile in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take\nother steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such\nnew knowledge has been obtained.\n\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other\nContributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the\nProgram, whether in the source code, object code or in any\ndocumentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4,\neach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4.

THE\nACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER\nASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\"LICENSE\"). ANY USE,\nREPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES\nTHE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nLicense Background\n\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We\nbelieve that the open source development approach can take appropriate\nsoftware programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and\ninnovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we\nare releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the\nProgram to use the Program, including its source code, freely and\nwithout many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.\nAlthough we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined\nbelow) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to\npermit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License\nunless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program\nmust be distributed under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under\nwhich you may use the Program.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and\n(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and\nadditions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the\nProgram originate from and are distributed by that particular\nContributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\nitself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do\nnot include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of\nsoftware distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\nlicense agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes\nthe Program.\n\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the\nProgram that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any\nContributions made to the Program thereafter.\n\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions\nthereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are\ninfringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined\nwith the Program.\n\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which\nthis License is attached and as released by CA, including source code,\nobject code and documentation, if any.\n\n1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the\nProgram.\n\n2.

The license granted in this Section\n2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\nif, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed\nby such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is\ngranted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not\ninclude the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance\nwith the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party\nmodifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of\nContributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except\nas part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with\nrespect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of\nContributions made by that Contributor.\n\n2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in\nSection 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the\nProgram does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\nrights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\nliability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity\nbased on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\ncondition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\nRecipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\nintellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,\ntitle and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the\nright to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent\nnotice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related\ndocumentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available\nfrom the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the\nsource code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in\nobject code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\na. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and \nb. its license agreement: \n\ti. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and \n\tconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\n\tand non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of \n\tmerchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent\n\tpermitted by applicable law;\n\tii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for \n\tdamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential \n\tdamages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable\n\tlaw; \n\tiii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are\n\toffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \n\tiv. states that source code for the Program is available from such \n\tContributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain\n\tit in a reasonable manner.\n\n3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\na. it must be made available under this License; and \nb. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution\nof the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge\nRecipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.\nContributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license\nfee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights\nunder this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source\ncode for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if\nany, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and\ndistribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a\nContributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a\nContributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an\nattempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties\nor other recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with\nother software code not governed by the terms of this License, and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the\nContributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may\nsubject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual\ncommitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and\nnon-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No\nContributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.\nTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to\ndefend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)\nwho made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial\nContributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)\narising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or\nLosses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement.\n\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted\nby such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)\ninclude a text file with the Program source code distribution titled\n../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates\nInternational, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York\n11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both\ndescribing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\nthat a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such\nmatter.
