  =======================================================================

  Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
  does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
  Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
  other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
  information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
  warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
  terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
  disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
  fullest extent possible.

  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
  original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
  and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
  following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
  exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
       intended for use by those authorized to give the public
       permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
       copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
       irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
       and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
       Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
       applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
       material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
       material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
       licensed material, or material used under an exception or
       limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
       licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
       licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
       the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
       example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
       copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
       licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
       other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
       the licensed material may still be restricted for other
       reasons, including because others have copyright or other
       rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
       such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
       Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
       respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
       for the public:

  Public License

  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
  Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
  ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
  interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
  consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
  Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
  Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
  these terms and conditions.


  Section 1 -- Definitions.

    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
       Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
       and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
       arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
       permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
       Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
       Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
       Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
       synched in timed relation with a moving image.

    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
       and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
       accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

       creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative
       Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

    d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
       closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
       performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
       Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
       categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
       specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
       Rights.

    e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
       absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
       fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
       agreements.

    f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
       any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
       that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

       Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

    h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
       or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
       License.

    i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
       terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
       all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the

    j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.

    k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
       commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
       this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
       other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
       file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
       no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
       exchange.

    l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
       as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
       available to the public including in ways that members of the
       public may access the material from a place and at a time
       individually chosen by them.

    m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
       resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
       the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,

       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

    n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


  Section 2 -- Scope.

    a. License grant.

         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                 NonCommercial purposes only.

         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.

         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).

         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.

         5. Downstream recipients.

              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.

              b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                 Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                 automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                 under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

              c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.

         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

    b. Other rights.

         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.

         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.

         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
            purposes.


  Section 3 -- License Conditions.

  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.

    a. Attribution.

         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:

              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:

                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by

         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be

            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent

       In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share

         1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
            license with the same License Elements, this version or
            later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

         2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
            Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
            in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
            context in which You Share Adapted Material.

         3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
            or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
            Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
            rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
       to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
       only;

    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
       including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
       all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
  replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
  Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
       EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
       AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
       ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
       IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
       ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
       KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
       ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
       TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
       COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
       USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
       DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.


  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
       terminate automatically.

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section 6(a), it reinstates:

         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or

         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.

    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.

    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
       License.


  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
       terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
       Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
       independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


  Section 8 -- Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
       shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
       be made without permission under this Public License.

    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
       deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
       without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.

    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
       Licensor.

    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
       as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
       that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
       processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2.

Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to \n                   receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by \n                   pseudonym if designated);\n\n               ii. a copyright notice;\n\n              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n               iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous \n               modifications; and\n\n            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text \n               of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1)\n           [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1] \n           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed \n           Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or \n           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section \n           3(a)(1)(A)[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A] \n           to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n    b. ShareAlike.\n\n    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following \n    conditions also apply.\n\n        1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License \n           Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n        2.

You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any \n           Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights \n           granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a1] grants You the right to extract, \n       reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for \n       NonCommercial purposes only;\n\n    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have \n       Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not \n       its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3b]; and\n\n    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a] \n       if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s4] supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers \n       the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind \n       concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory \n       (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, \n       incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising \n       out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of \n       the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not \n       allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a \n       manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of \n       all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\n    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, \n       if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate \n       automatically.\n\n    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a], it reinstates:\n\n        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your \n           discovery of the violation; or\n\n        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b)\n    [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6b] \n    does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public \n    License.\n\n    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or \n       conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not \n       terminate this Public License.\n\n    d. Sections 1[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s1], \n       5[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s5], \n       6[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6], \n       7[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s7], \n       and 8[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s8] \n       survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by \n       You unless expressly agreed.\n\n    b.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, \n       limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made \n       without permission under this Public License.\n\n    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be \n       automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision \n       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability \n       of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to \n       unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n    d.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a)\n           [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a].\n\n        4.

Downstream recipients.\n            A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material \n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the \n               terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n            B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.

Other rights.\n\n        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are \n           publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the \n           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited \n           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the \n           exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any \n           voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor \n           expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is \n           used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n    a. Attribution.\n\n        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to \n                   receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by \n                   pseudonym if designated);\n\n               ii. a copyright notice;\n\n              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n               iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous \n               modifications; and\n\n            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text \n               of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1)\n           [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1] \n           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed \n           Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or \n           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section \n           3(a)(1)(A)[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A] \n           to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n    b. ShareAlike.\n\n    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following \n    conditions also apply.\n\n        1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License \n           Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You \n           may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in \n           which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any \n           Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights \n           granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a1] grants You the right to extract, \n       reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for \n       NonCommercial purposes only;\n\n    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have \n       Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not \n       its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3b]; and\n\n    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a] \n       if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s4] supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers \n       the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind \n       concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, \n       without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, \n       non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, \n       whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in \n       part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory \n       (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, \n       incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising \n       out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of \n       the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not \n       allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a \n       manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of \n       all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\n    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, \n       if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate \n       automatically.\n\n    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a)\n       [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a], it reinstates:\n\n        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your \n           discovery of the violation; or\n\n        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b)\n    [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6b] \n    does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public \n    License.\n\n    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or \n       conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not \n       terminate this Public License.\n\n    d. Sections 1[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s1], \n       5[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s5], \n       6[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6], \n       7[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s7], \n       and 8[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode#s8] \n       survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by \n       You unless expressly agreed.\n\n    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are \n       separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\n    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, \n       limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made \n       without permission under this Public License.\n\n    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be \n       automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision \n       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability \n       of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to \n       unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, \n       any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes \n       of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n               NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.
