#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  VIM LICENSE

  I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
      that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
      unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
      include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
      that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
      examples and Vim scripts.

  II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
      including executables and/or source code, when the following four
      conditions are met:
      1) This license text must be included unmodified.
      2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
         a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
  	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
  	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
  	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
  	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
  	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
  	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
  	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
  	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
  	The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this 
  	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
  	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
  	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
  	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
  	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
         b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
  	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
  	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
  	  text under a) applies to those changes.
         c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
  	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
  	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
  	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
  	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
         d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
  	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
  	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
  	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
  	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
  	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
  	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
  	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
  	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
  	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
  	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
  	    available to him.
  	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
  	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
  	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
  	    as possible.
         e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
  	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
  	  any later version.
      3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
         command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
         is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
         under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
         not conflict with the license used for the changes.
      4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
         removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
         corrections.

  III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
       the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
       maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
       by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
       If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
       context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
  <maintainer@vim.org> 

  IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
       sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
       license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
       with, at your option.


  Note:

  - If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this
    file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.

  - If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a
    |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.

  - According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.
    A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
    make a difference.

  - If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
    further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change
    anything in Vim.

  - Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
    further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

  - If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
    contact information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the
    MODIFIED_BY define.

The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\n- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.\n  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not\n  make a difference.\n\n- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits\n  further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change\n  anything in Vim.\n\n- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all\n  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.\n\n- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and\n  contact information with the \"--with-modified-by\" configure argument or the\n  MODIFIED_BY define.",

The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n<maintainer@vim.org> \n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\n     with, at your option.\n\n\nNote:\n\n- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this\n  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.\n\n- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a\n  |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\n- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.\n  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not\n  make a difference.\n\n- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits\n  further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change\n  anything in Vim.\n\n- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all\n  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.\n\n- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and\n  contact information with the \"--with-modified-by\" configure argument or the\n  MODIFIED_BY define.",
