  CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
  LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN
  ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
  ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
  INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
  ITS USE.

  License

  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
  COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
  AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
  TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
  RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
  AND CONDITIONS.

  1. Definitions

  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
  encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
  along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
  independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.
  A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
  Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
  other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
  dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
  recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form
  in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a
  work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
  Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
  doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
  synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
  ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
  this License.

  "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
  terms of this License.

  "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
  terms of this License.

  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
  who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
  to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
  exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 2. Fair
  Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
  restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
  limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
  copyright law or other applicable laws.

  3. License Grant. 

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
  duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
  the Work as stated below:

  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
  Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
  Collective Works;

  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
  the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
  such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
  in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
  Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
  hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
  Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

  4. Restrictions.

  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
  limited by the following restrictions:

  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
  digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
  must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
  License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
  publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
  may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
  terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
  hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
  notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
  digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
  access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
  this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
  a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
  from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
  You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
  the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to
  such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

  You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
  in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
  commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
  the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
  otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
  commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
  no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
  of copyrighted works.

  If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
  digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices
  for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
  medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
  applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
  supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
  Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
  Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
  licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in
  any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
  Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
  comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
  prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
  rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
  performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if
  that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
  advantage or private monetary compensation.

  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
  agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
  phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
  subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
  US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
  distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed
  toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
  where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
  right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights
  society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
  performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory
  license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the
  equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance
  is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
  private monetary compensation.

  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
  KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
  LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
  WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
  EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  6. Limitation on Liability.

  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
  LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
  THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
  OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. Termination

  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
  Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
  under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
  provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
  those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
  termination of this License.

  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
  Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
  any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
  withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
  required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
  License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
  stated above.

  8. Miscellaneous

  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
  Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
  Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
  under this License.

  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
  the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
  by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
  enforceable.

  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
  breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
  and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
  respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
  agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
  here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
  appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
  without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
  whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
  liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
  whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
  incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
  license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
  Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
  shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

  Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work
  is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
  "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons
  without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use
  will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark
  usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made
  available upon request from time to time.
