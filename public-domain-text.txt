Public-domain implementation of ANSI C library routine.

It's written in old-style C for maximal portability.
However, since I'm used to prototypes, I've included them too.

If you want stuff in the System V ascftime routine, add the SYSV_EXT define.
For extensions from SunOS, add SUNOS_EXT.
For stuff needed to implement the P1003.2 date command, add POSIX2_DATE.
For VMS dates, add VMS_EXT.
For a an RFC822 time format, add MAILHEADER_EXT.
For ISO week years, add ISO_DATE_EXT.
For complete POSIX semantics, add POSIX_SEMANTICS.

The code for %c, %x, and %X now follows the 1003.2 specification for
the POSIX locale.
This version ignores LOCALE information.
It also doesn't worry about multi-byte characters.
So there.

This file is also shipped with GAWK (GNU Awk), gawk specific bits of
code are included if GAWK is defined.

is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
