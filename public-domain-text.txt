**  jseymour  1998/04/04 17:45 EST
**	Before adding this to minicom (as part of my "getsdir()" addition),
**	I emailed a request to Rich $alz, asking if I could "GPL" it.  Here
**	is his reply:
**
**	    Date: Mon, 30 Mar 1998 10:50:06 -0500 (EST)
**	    Message-Id: <199803301550.KAA14018@<anonymized>.com>
**	    From: Rich Salz <salzr@<anonymized>.com>
**	    To: jseymour@jimsun.LinxNet.com
**	    Subject: Re: A Little Thing Named "Wildmat"
**
**	    Wildmat is in the public domain -- enjoy it.
**
**	    I would rather it not get encumbered with various licenses,
**	    but since it is in the public domain you can do what you want...
**
**	So there you go.  (I anonymized his email address as I don't know
**	that he was particularly interested in having it "advertised".)

Public-domain implementation of ANSI C library routine.

It's written in old-style C for maximal portability.
However, since I'm used to prototypes, I've included them too.

If you want stuff in the System V ascftime routine, add the SYSV_EXT define.
For extensions from SunOS, add SUNOS_EXT.
For stuff needed to implement the P1003.2 date command, add POSIX2_DATE.
For VMS dates, add VMS_EXT.
For a an RFC822 time format, add MAILHEADER_EXT.
For ISO week years, add ISO_DATE_EXT.
For complete POSIX semantics, add POSIX_SEMANTICS.

The code for %c, %x, and %X now follows the 1003.2 specification for
the POSIX locale.
This version ignores LOCALE information.
It also doesn't worry about multi-byte characters.
So there.

This file is also shipped with GAWK (GNU Awk), gawk specific bits of
code are included if GAWK is defined.

will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

(This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.
