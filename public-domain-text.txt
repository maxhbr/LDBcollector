Public-domain implementation of ANSI C library routine.

It's written in old-style C for maximal portability.
However, since I'm used to prototypes, I've included them too.

If you want stuff in the System V ascftime routine, add the SYSV_EXT define.
For extensions from SunOS, add SUNOS_EXT.
For stuff needed to implement the P1003.2 date command, add POSIX2_DATE.
For VMS dates, add VMS_EXT.
For a an RFC822 time format, add MAILHEADER_EXT.
For ISO week years, add ISO_DATE_EXT.
For complete POSIX semantics, add POSIX_SEMANTICS.

The code for %c, %x, and %X now follows the 1003.2 specification for
the POSIX locale.
This version ignores LOCALE information.
It also doesn't worry about multi-byte characters.
So there.

This file is also shipped with GAWK (GNU Awk), gawk specific bits of
code are included if GAWK is defined.

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

This is the header file for the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
Md5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'
header definitions

Still in the public domain.

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.

Before adding this to minicom (as part of my "getsdir()" addition),
I emailed a request to Rich $alz, asking if I could "GPL" it.  Here
is his reply:

    Date: Mon, 30 Mar 1998 10:50:06 -0500 (EST)
    Message-Id: <199803301550.KAA14018@<anonymized>.com>
    From: Rich Salz <salzr@<anonymized>.com>
    To: jseymour@jimsun.LinxNet.com
    Subject: Re: A Little Thing Named "Wildmat"

    Wildmat is in the public domain -- enjoy it.

    I would rather it not get encumbered with various licenses,
    but since it is in the public domain you can do what you want...

So there you go.  (I anonymized his email address as I don't know
that he was particularly interested in having it "advertised".)
