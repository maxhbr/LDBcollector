  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
