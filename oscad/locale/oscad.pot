"This OSLiC was presented on the European Legal and Licensing Workshop 2013 in"
" Amsterdam.  It was very welcomed. But the very benevolent feedback of this "
"meeting also expressed the need to have an interactive version of the OSLiC "
"instead of being thrown back to the slightly unwieldy pdf version. The OSCAd "
"seizes this idea. Initially, the OSCAd was developed by some employees of "
"Deutsche Telekom AG."
