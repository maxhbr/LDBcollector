This license was found in texlive-texmf, in texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex.

The FSF's rationale regarding the LaTeX Project Public License 1.2 applies to this specific scenario: http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses

 This license contains complex and annoying restrictions on how to
 publish a modified version, including one requirement that falls
 just barely on the good side of the line of what is acceptable: that
 any modified file must have a new name.

 The reason this requirement is acceptable for LaTeX is that TeX has
 a facility to allow you to map file names, to specify “use file bar
 when file foo is requested”. With this facility, the requirement is
 merely annoying; without the facility, the same requirement would be
 a serious obstacle, and we would have to conclude it makes the
 program non-free.

Thus, this license is free but GPL incompatible, but only on TeX files. If this license were applied to unrelated code, it would almost certainly be non-free due to the renaming restriction.
