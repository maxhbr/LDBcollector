not found in Fedora currently, don't add to SPDX  There is no link to version
1.0 of the license on http://old.zope.org/Resources/License/ eventhough this
version is mentioned. The link http://www.zope.org/Resources/ZPL now gives a
404ish "Die Seite existiert leider nichtâ€¦" fine to add if someone can find a
version of the license text; it is listed here:
http://old.zope.org/Resources/License/ (as well as other older licenses) but no
active link) Reject (old licensethat has been replaced at least 3 times since
1.0 and can't find copy of old license)"
