    \      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\
    \n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n\

    \ shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n      other entities that\
    \ control, are controlled by, or are under common\n      control with that entity.\
    \ For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power,\
    \ direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity,\
    \ whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\

    \     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\"\
    \ shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based\
    \ on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions,\

    \      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n \
    \     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted\

    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\
    \ against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\
    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\
    \ constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\
    \ reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof\
    \ in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object\
    \ form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You\
    \ must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a\
    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\

    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\

    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability."

    \     as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n   \
    \     Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n\
    \        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n\
    \        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such\
    \ Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under\
    \ different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form\
    \ does not attempt to limit or alter the\n        recipients' rights in the Source\
    \ Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n    \
    \ You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n  \
    \   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n\
    \     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n \
    \    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n\
    \     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n   \
    \  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n    \
    \ under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n   \
    \  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n    \
    \ Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\
    \n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license\
    \ notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\
    \ or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\
    \ the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\
    \ the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application\
    \ of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\
    \ warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients\
    \ of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and\
    \ not on\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that\
    \ any\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered\
    \ by\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for\
    \ any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n\
    \     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n   \
    \  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n    \
    \ jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If\
    \ it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n \
    \  with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial\
    \ order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License\
    \ to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the\
    \ code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included\
    \ with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except\
    \ to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must\
    \ be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to\
    \ understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License\
    \ will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms.\
    \ However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License\
    \ from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless\
    \ and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,\
    \ and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of\
    \ the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You\
    \ have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\
    \ Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies\
    \ You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first\
    \ time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from\
    \ such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your\
    \ receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any\
    \ entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory\
    \ judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor\
    \ Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\
    \ to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n\
    \     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination\
    \ under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding\
    \ distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or\
    \ Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive\
    \ termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided\
    \ under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind,\
    \ either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation,\
    \ warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit\
    \ for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality\
    \ and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered\
    \ Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume\
    \ the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer\
    \ of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any\
    \ Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\
    \n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\
    \ whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,\
    \ or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable\
    \ to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages\
    \ of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,\
    \ loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any\
    \ and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have\
    \ been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n\
    \   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n\
    \   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation.\
    \ Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental\
    \ or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply\
    \ to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be\
    \ brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains\
    \ its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by\
    \ laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\
    \ Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims\
    \ or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the\
    \ complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision\
    \ of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed\
    \ only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation\
    \ which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against\
    \ the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\
    \n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation\
    \ is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other\
    \ than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions\
    \ of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version\
    \ number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered\
    \ Software under the terms of the version\n      of the License under which You\
    \ originally received the Covered Software,\n      or under the terms of any subsequent\
    \ version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\
    \n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n\
    \      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n    \
    \  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n   \
    \   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n \
    \     such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing\
    \ Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n      Licenses If You\
    \ choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n      Incompatible With Secondary\
    \ Licenses under the terms of this version of\n      the License, the notice described\
    \ in Exhibit B of this License must be\n      attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source\

    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt\
    \ to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2.\

    \ Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source\
    \ Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients\
    \ of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n\
    \    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than\
    \ the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such\
    \ Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under\
    \ different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does\
    \ not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create\
    \ and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You\
    \ also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.\
    \ If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed\
    \ by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible\
    \ With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute\
    \ such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that\
    \ the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the\
    \ Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n\
    License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\

    \ of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\
    \ support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n\
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of\
    \ any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms\
    \ You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations\
    \ of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to\
    \ Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense\
    \ with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial\
    \ order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License\
    \ to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code\
    \ they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all\
    \ distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent\
    \ prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will\
    \ terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However,\
    \ if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a\
    \ particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n\
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing\
    \ basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some\
    \ reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.\
    \ Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing\
    \ basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable\
    \ means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with\
    \ this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days\
    \ after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against\
    \ any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory\
    \ judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor\
    \ Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\
    \ to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n\
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under\
    \ Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors\
    \ and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors\
    \ under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n\

    \ the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision\
    \ of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed\

    \ Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute,\
    \ must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the\
    \ Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n\
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt\
    \ to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2.\

    \ of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n\
    \    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than\
    \ the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such\
    \ Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under\
    \ different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does\
    \ not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create\
    \ and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You\
    \ also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.\
    \ If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed\
    \ by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible\
    \ With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute\
    \ such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that\
    \ the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the\
    \ Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n\
    License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\

    \ any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms\
    \ You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations\
    \ of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to\
    \ Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License\
    \ to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code\
    \ they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all\
    \ distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent\
    \ prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will\
    \ terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However,\
    \ if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a\
    \ particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n\
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing\
    \ basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some\
    \ reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.\
    \ Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing\
    \ basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable\
    \ means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with\
    \ this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days\
    \ after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against\
    \ any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory\
    \ judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor\
    \ Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\
    \ to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n\
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under\
    \ Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors\
    \ and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors\
    \ under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n\

    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which\
    \ such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation\

    \ alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work\

    \ licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
    \      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may\
    \ reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof\

    \ must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a\
    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\
    \ enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.\

    \ or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed\

    \ copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\

    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices\
    \ that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n\
    \      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      \
    \    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      \
    \    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within\
    \ such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to\
    \ any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following\
    \ places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative\
    \ Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along\
    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
    \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n  \
    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   \
    \   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n     \
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
    \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
    \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
    \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
    \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \
    \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How\
    \ to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License\
    \ to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields\
    \ enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.\

    \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n    \
    \      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\

    \ with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the\
    \ Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
    \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
    \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\

    \        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      \
    \    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as\
    \ modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to\
    \ Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms\

    \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
    \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License\
    \ does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable\
    \ and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\
    \ (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
    \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n     \
    \ implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n     \

    \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
    \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
    \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
    \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
    \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\
    \ (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
    \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
    \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
    \ of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
    \ or additional liability."

    \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
    \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
    \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
    \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
    \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
    \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
    \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
    \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
