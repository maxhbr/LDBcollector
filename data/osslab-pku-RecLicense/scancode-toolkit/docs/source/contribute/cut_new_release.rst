How to cut a new release:
=========================

Update version
--------------

- Run bumpversion with major, minor or patch to bump the version in
  ``setup.cfg`` and ``src/scancode_config.py``. Note that this is CalVer.

- If scancode output data format is changed, increment manually the major, minor or patch
  to bump the version in ``src/scancode_config.py``. Note that this is SemVer.

Tag and publish
---------------

- Update the CHANGELOG.rst

- Commit these changes and push changes to develop:

    - ``git commit -m "commit message"``
    - ``git push --set-upstream origin develop``

- Merge develop branch in master and tag the release.

    - ``git checkout master``
    - ``git merge develop``
    - ``git tag -a v1.6.1 -m "Release v1.6.1"``
    - ``git push --set-upstream origin master``
    - ``git push --set-upstream origin v1.6.1``

- Draft a new release in GitHub, using the previous release blurb as a base. Highlight new and
  noteworthy changes from the CHANGELOG.rst.

Create Release on GitHub
------------------------

- Run ``etc/release/scancode_release.sh`` locally.

- Upload the release archives created in the ``dist/`` directory to the GitHub release page.

- Save the release as a draft. Use the previous release notes to create notes in the same style.
  Ensure that the link to third-party source code is present.

- test the downloads.

- publish the release on GitHub

Upload wheels to pypi and Test
------------------------------

- then build and publish the released wheel on Pypi. For this you need your own Pypi credentials
  (and get authorized to publish Pypi release: ask @pombredanne) and you need to have the ``twine``
  package installed and configured.

  - Build a ``.whl`` and source distribution with ``python setup.py release``
  - Run twine with ``twine upload dist/``
  - Once uploaded check the published release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scancode-toolkit/
  - Then create a new fresh local virtualenv and test the wheel installation with:
    ``pip install scancode-toolkit[full]``
