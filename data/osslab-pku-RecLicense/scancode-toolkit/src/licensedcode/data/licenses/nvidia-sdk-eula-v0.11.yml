    Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing, copying or using the
    licensed software:
    This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement”) is a
    legal agreement
    between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a
    NVIDIA
    software development kit (“SDK”).
    Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a
    description of the types
    of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs,
    data sets and
    assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native
    API input/
    output files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs,
    programming
    code and documentation.
    This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in
    the country
    in which the SDK is used.
    If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other
    legal entity, you
    represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this
    Agreement, in which
    case “you” will mean the entity you represent.
    If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement,
    or if you don’t
    accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download,
    install or use
    the SDK.
    You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
    Agreement,
    and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
    guidelines in
    the relevant jurisdictions.
