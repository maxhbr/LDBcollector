short_name: BSLA no advertizing
name: Berkeley Software License Agreement with no advertizing
category: Permissive
owner: Regents of the University of California
notes: this is a variant of the license introuced by changes in Cygwin to remove the advertizing
    clause since it has been "rescinded" by the UC regents for their BSD-licensed code at large.
