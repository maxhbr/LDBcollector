                        Linking exception clause


  The Genode OS Framework (Genode) is licensed under the terms of the
  GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3).

  Linking Genode code statically or dynamically with other modules
  is making a combined work based on Genode. Thus, the terms and
  conditions of the AGPLv3 cover the whole combination.

  As an "additional permission" as defined by Section 7 of the
  AGPLv3, Genode Labs as the copyright holder of Genode gives you
  permission to link Genode source code with "independent modules"
  to produce an executable if the independent modules are licensed
  under an "approved license", and to copy and distribute the
  resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
  also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
  conditions of the license of that module.

  An "approved license" is a license that is officially approved as
  an Open-Source license by the Open Source Initiative [1], or
  listed as a Free-Software license by the Free Software Foundation
  [2], or explicitly approved by Genode Labs.

  An "independent module" is a module which is not derived from or
  based on Genode, or merely uses the Genode API as defined in the
  official documentation.

  If you modify Genode, you may extend this exception to your
  version of Genode, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not
  wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
