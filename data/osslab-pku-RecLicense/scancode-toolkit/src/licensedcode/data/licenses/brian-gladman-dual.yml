    BrianGladman commented on Nov 9, 2015 Hi Jonas, I really wish now that I had not done this
    dual licensing as the BSD license should have been sufficient. But someone at the time wouldn't
    accept this and insisted on the GPL. You can interpret the GPL license on any of my code
    wherever it appears as "ALTERNATIVELY, provided that this notice is retained in full, this
    product may be distributed under the terms of a GNU General Public License (GPL) of your
    choice, in which case the provisions of this GPL apply INSTEAD OF those given above." I
    hope that helps, if not please get back to me.
