notes: |
    Per Fedora, this is an Apache 1.1 derived license. Unfortunately, clause 4
    is too broad, making it Free but GPL-incompatible. It does also replace the
    deprecated keys classworlds and apache-due-credit that were the same licenses.
    Plexus Classworlds was started in 2002 and dom4j in 2000/2001 hence it has precedence.
    Other projects such as Exolab/Intalio/Castor and JCharts have used the same license.
    Castor is actually the first to use this but dom4j is still commonly used and castor less so.
