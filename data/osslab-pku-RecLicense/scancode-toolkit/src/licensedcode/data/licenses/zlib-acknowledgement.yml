notes: |
    Per Fedora, this license is the same as zlib, except that it requires that
    an acknowledgement be made in the product documentation. For Fedora, this
    is our Release notes, so if you have any packages which use this license,
    you MUST be sure to have the appropriate acknowledgement in the release
    notes.
