the project used an extended version of the DCO
that included the identical items (a) through (d) from DCO 1.1 and an
additional item (e):

(e) The contribution can be licensed under the modified BSD license
    as shown below even in case of files that are currently licensed
    under other terms.

This was used during the period when some of the files included the old
license terms. Acceptance of this extended DCO version was indicated
with a Signed-hostap tag in the commit message. This additional item (e)
was used to collect explicit approval to license the contribution with
only the modified BSD license (see below), i.e., without the GPL v2
option. This was done to allow simpler licensing terms to be used in the
future. It should be noted that the modified BSD license is compatible
with GNU GPL and as such, this possible move to simpler licensing option
does not prevent use of this software in GPL projects.
