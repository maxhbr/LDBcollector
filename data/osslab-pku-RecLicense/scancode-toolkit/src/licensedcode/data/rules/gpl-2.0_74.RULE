If you distribute GPL-licensed software the license requires that you also
distribute the source code to that GPL-licensed software.  If you distribute
BusyBox without making the source code to the version you distribute available,
you violate the license terms, and thus infringe on the copyrights of BusyBox.
This requirement applies whether or not you modified BusyBox; either way the
license terms still apply to you.
