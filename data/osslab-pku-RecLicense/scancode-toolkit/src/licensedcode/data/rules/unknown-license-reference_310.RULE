subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source 
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code. 
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.
