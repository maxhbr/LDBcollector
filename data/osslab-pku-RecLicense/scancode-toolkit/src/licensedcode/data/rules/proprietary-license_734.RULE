Artless Devices does not and cannot guarantee that any license available via indiecc.com will meet your legal needs. Only a lawyer engaged to provide you legal advice, who can ask questions about you and your legal needs in confidence, can do that.

No Warranties

indiecc.com is provided as is and as available. Artless Devices expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. indiecc.com may not meet your requirements, suffer interruptions, security breaches, and errors. You bear all risk of using indiecc.com.
