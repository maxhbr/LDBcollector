I am happy for this code to be used without payment provided that I don't carry
any risks as a result. I would appreciate an appropriate acknowledgement of the
source of the code if you do use it in a product or activity provided to third parties. 

I would also be grateful for feedback on how the code is being used, any problems
you encounter, any changes or additions that are desirable for particular
processors and any more general improvements you would like to see (no promises mind!).
