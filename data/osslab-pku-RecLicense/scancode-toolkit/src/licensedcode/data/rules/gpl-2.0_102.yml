license_expression: gpl-2.0
is_license_text: yes
notes: |
    This is the next version of the GPL text as published by the FSF.
    Let's call it the GPL 2.0.2
    This variation was published around about the time of the FSF office
    move on May 1, 2005 from Temple Place to Franklin Street
    http://web.archive.org/web/20050507090312/http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html
    In this HTML version, it refers to the Franklin St address and uses the
    GNU Library General Public License at the top and GNU Lesser General Public License
    at the bottom with still a split opinion on which one to use of the LGPL 2 or 2.1
    This is mostly about an address change.
    The corresponding text version at
    http://web.archive.org/web/20050507090312/http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.txt
    was not updated for a few days.
