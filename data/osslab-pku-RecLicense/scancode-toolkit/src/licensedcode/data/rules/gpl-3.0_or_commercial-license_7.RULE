License


oRTP is dual licensed, and is available either :

 - under a [GNU/GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), for free (open source). Please make sure that you understand and agree with the terms of this license before using it (see LICENSE.txt file for details).

 - under a proprietary license, for a fee, to be used in closed source applications. Contact [Belledonne Communications](https://www.linphone.org/contact) for any question about costs and services.

Prior to version 1.0.0, oRTP was licensed under LGPLv2. Due to inclusion of new code licensed under GPLv2, oRTP has become GPLv2,
and later in version 1.1.0, GPLv3.
For the sake of clarity, all source files headers were updated to mention the GPLv3 only.
oRTP versions prior to 1.0.0 of course remain LGPLv2.
