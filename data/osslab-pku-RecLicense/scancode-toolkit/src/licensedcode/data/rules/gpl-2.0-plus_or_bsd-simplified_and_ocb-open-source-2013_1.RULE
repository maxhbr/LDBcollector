The BSD license is (almost?) strictly more permissive, but the
additionally licensing under the GPL allows us to use OCB 2.0 code
royalty-free (at least, if OCB 2.0's creator Phil Rogaway has anything
to say about it).  Note that if you redistribute SJCL under a license
other than the GPL, you or your users may need to pay patent licensing
fees for OCB 2.0.

There may be patents which apply to SJCL other than Phil Rogaway's OCB
patents.  We suggest that you consult legal counsel before using SJCL
in a commercial project.
