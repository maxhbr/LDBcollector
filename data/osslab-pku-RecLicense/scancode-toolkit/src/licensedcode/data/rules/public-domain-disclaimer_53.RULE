Because of the number of inquiries I was receiving about the  use
of this product in commercially developed works I have decided to
simply make it public domain to further its unrestricted use.    I
specifically  would  be  most happy to see this material become a
part of the standard Unix distributions by AT&T and the  Berkeley
Computer  Science  Research Group, and a standard part of the GNU
system from the Free Software Foundation.

I would appreciate it, as a courtesy, if this notice is  left  in
all copies and derivative works.  Thank you.
