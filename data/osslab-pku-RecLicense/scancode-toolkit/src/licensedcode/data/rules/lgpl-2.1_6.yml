license_expression: lgpl-2.1
is_license_notice: yes
notes: This text is from the GPL 2.0 with a manual replacement to make it look like an LGPL
    2.1 notice. This introduces a bias in license detection towards GPL 2.0 when this is really
    an LGPL 2.1 license. This weird license header was originally found in the source code  of
    the http://sourceforge.net/projects/glassbox/ project.
