 For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
 than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
 use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
 for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
 available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
 version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
 is applied is otherwise unspecified.
