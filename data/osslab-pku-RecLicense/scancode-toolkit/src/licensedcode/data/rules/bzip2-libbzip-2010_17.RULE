    bzip2/libbzip2 version 1.0.4 of 20 December 2006 

    Please read and be aware of the following:

    WARNING:

       This program and library (attempts to) compress data by 
       performing several non-trivial transformations on it.  
       Unless you are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms 
       contained herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, 
       you should NOT meddle with the compression or decompression 
       machinery.  Incorrect changes can and very likely *will* 
       lead to disastrous loss of data.


    DISCLAIMER:

       I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE
       USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.

       Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the
       compressed file can be decompressed to reproduce the original.
       Great efforts in design, coding and testing have been made to
       ensure that this program works correctly.  However, the complexity
       of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various
       special cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero
       probability make it impossible to rule out the possibility of bugs
       remaining in the program.  DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA WITH THIS
       PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER
       SMALL, THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

       That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable.  
       Indeed, I very much hope the opposite is true.  bzip2/libbzip2 
       has been carefully constructed and extensively tested.


    PATENTS:

       To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any 
       patented algorithms.  However, I do not have the resources 
       to carry out a patent search.  Therefore I cannot give any 
       guarantee of the above statement.
