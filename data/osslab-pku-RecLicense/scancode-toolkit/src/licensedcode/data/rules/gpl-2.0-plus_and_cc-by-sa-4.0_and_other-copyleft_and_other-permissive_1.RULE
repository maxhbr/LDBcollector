Introduction

The operating system and the different components available in the Mageia distribution
shall be called the "Software Products" hereafter. The Software Products include, but are not
restricted to, the set of programs, methods, rules and documentation related to the operating
system and the different components of the Mageia distribution, and any applications
distributed with these products provided by Mageia's licensors or suppliers.
1. License Agreement

Please read this document carefully. This document is a license agreement between you and
Mageia which applies to the Software Products.
By installing, duplicating or using any of the Software Products in any manner, you explicitly
accept and fully agree to conform to the terms and conditions of this License.
If you disagree with any portion of the License, you are not allowed to install, duplicate or use
the Software Products.
Any attempt to install, duplicate or use the Software Products in a manner which does not comply
with the terms and conditions of this License is void and will terminate your rights under this
License. Upon termination of the License, you must immediately destroy all copies of the
Software Products.
2. Limited Warranty

The Software Products and attached documentation are provided "as is", with no warranty, to the
extent permitted by law.
Neither Mageia nor its licensors or suppliers will, in any circumstances and to the extent
permitted by law, be liable for any special, incidental, direct or indirect damages whatsoever
(including without limitation damages for loss of business, interruption of business, financial
loss, legal fees and penalties resulting from a court judgment, or any other consequential loss)
arising out of the use or inability to use the Software Products, even if Mageia or its
licensors or suppliers have been advised of the possibility or occurrence of such damages.

LIMITED LIABILITY LINKED TO POSSESSING OR USING PROHIBITED SOFTWARE IN SOME COUNTRIES

To the extent permitted by law, neither Mageia nor its licensors, suppliers or
distributors will, in any circumstances, be liable for any special, incidental, direct or indirect
damages whatsoever (including without limitation damages for loss of business, interruption of
business, financial loss, legal fees and penalties resulting from a court judgment, or any
other consequential loss) arising out of the possession and use of software components or
arising out of downloading software components from one of Mageia sites which are
prohibited or restricted in some countries by local laws.
This limited liability applies to, but is not restricted to, the strong cryptography components
included in the Software Products.
However, because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.
3. The GPL License and Related Licenses

The Software Products consist of components created by different persons or entities.
Most of these licenses allow you to use, duplicate, adapt or redistribute the components which
they cover. Please read carefully the terms and conditions of the license agreement for each component
before using any component. Any question on a component license should be addressed to the component
licensor or supplier and not to Mageia.
The programs developed by Mageia are governed by the GPL License. Documentation written
by Mageia is governed by "CC-By-SA" License.
4. Intellectual Property Rights

All rights to the components of the Software Products belong to their respective authors and are
protected by intellectual property and copyright laws applicable to software programs.
Mageia and its suppliers and licensors reserves their rights to modify or adapt the Software
Products, as a whole or in parts, by all means and for all purposes.
"Mageia" and associated logos are trademarks of Mageia.Org
5. Governing Laws

If any portion of this agreement is held void, illegal or inapplicable by a court judgment, this
portion is excluded from this contract. You remain bound by the other applicable sections of the
agreement.
The terms and conditions of this License are governed by the Laws of France.
All disputes on the terms of this license will preferably be settled out of court. As a last
resort, the dispute will be referred to the appropriate Courts of Law of Paris - France.
