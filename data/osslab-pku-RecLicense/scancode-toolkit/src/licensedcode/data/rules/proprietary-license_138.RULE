TQ-Systems Software License Agreement Version 1.0.2

It is permitted to copy and distribute this document true to word.

The software license is bound to the use of the TQ-Systems hardware.
The software is classified as product-specific software.
The software is provided exclusively in machine-readable form (binary or 
object code).

ยง1 Scope of Use and Usage Period
  1. The rights to the TQ software - in particular the copyright and 
     additional industrial property rights - shall remain exclusively 
     with TQ even if the software has been modified by you or your 
     company.
     You are prohibited from using this Software in any way other than 
     as described in the following provisions of this Agreement.
  2. The ordinary, non-exclusive right to use the Software shall only 
     apply in direct connection with the Product Hardware. Product 
     hardware means that the hardware has been produced by TQ or a 
     company affiliated with TQ and that the software has been developed 
     specifically for that hardware.
     You are prohibited from using the software developed by us on 
     hardware products from third parties.
     Any transfer to third parties is bound by the provisions of this 
     Agreement.
  3. You are obliged to report every activity to TQ in writing, with the 
     exception of those actions which, according to the conditions of 
     the Copyright Act (UrhG), do not require the release of the rights 
     holder.
     Outside the scope of the cases specified in the Copyright Act 
     (UrhG), you are not entitled to modify, reverse engineer or 
     translate the software.
     If our software as a work uses software parts of third parties and  
     therefore paragraph 1, subparagraph 3. contradicts license 
     conditions applicable to these software parts of third parties, we 
     additionally grant you the right to obtain permission to modify our 
     software in binary form for your own use only and to carry out 
     reverse engineering for the purpose of debugging these 
     modifications. You may not distribute the modified version to third 
     parties in any format.
  4. Any use of the software that goes beyond the scope of the previous 
     provisions requires our written consent.
  5. We reserve the right to assert claims for damages.
  6. You are only entitled to sub-license the software in connection 
     with the product hardware.
  7. In the event of sub-licensing, you must also ensure that no 
     additional rights to the Software are granted to sublicensees other 
     than those granted to you under these License Terms.
  8. If you transfer your rights to the Software to any third party, you 
     must destroy any untransferred copies of the Software.

ยง2 Warranty; Liability
  1. We expressly point out that it is not possible according to the 
     state of the art to develop more complex software in such a way 
     that an error-free function is guaranteed under all application 
     conditions. We therefore only guarantee that the delivered software 
     is suitable for contractual use in accordance with the description 
     created or accepted by us.
  2. In case of larger and comprehensible deviations of the software 
     functionality from the product description or specification, we are 
     entitled to either refund the purchase price paid by you, or a 
     subsequent performance in the form of a repair within the framework 
     of a reasonable period or to arrange for a replacement delivery of 
     the Product.
     In the event of significant and reproducible deviations in the 
     functionality of the software from the product description or 
     specification, we shall be entitled, at our discretion, either to 
     refund the purchase price paid by you or to subsequent performance 
     within a reasonable period of time by way of repair or new 
     delivery. If, within the framework of the supplementary performance 
     chosen by us, we are unable to eliminate the considerable 
     deviations in the functionality of the software that have occurred 
     within a reasonable period by providing a defect-free update or 
     upgrade of the software or to circumvent them in such a way that 
     you are able to use the software in accordance with the contract, 
     you may claim a reduction in the agreed remuneration or withdraw 
     from the contract. Any further claims are excluded to the extent 
     permitted by law.
  3. We do not warrant for minor deviations in the functionality of the 
     software from the product description or specification.
  4. The warranty period is one (1) year, unless longer periods are 
     required by law. It begins with the acceptance of the software by 
     you or - if a formal acceptance is not planned or does not take 
     place - at the latest two (2) weeks after delivery or actual 
     transfer.
  5. We do not warrant or assume any liability beyond the scope of use 
     described in paragraph 1 with respect to the proper selection, 
     application and use of the Software. This applies in particular to 
     improper use, in particular the use of incompatible hardware or 
     software, modifications or extensions to the software made 
     independently by or at your instigation, the culpable omission of 
     regular data backup and other cases of incorrect or negligent 
     handling by you. 
     If you use the software outside these license terms, all warranty 
     and liability claims are void. The aforementioned warranty or 
     liability limitations shall not apply in cases of injury to life, 
     limb or health, in cases of liability falling within the scope of 
     the Product Liability Act, insofar as the software lacks a property 
     or quality expressly warranted by us or we are at fault in the form 
     of intent or gross negligence.
