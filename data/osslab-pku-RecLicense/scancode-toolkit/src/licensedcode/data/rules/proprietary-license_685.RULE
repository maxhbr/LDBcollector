personal or business uses you'd like, and I ask for no money. I
would, however, like to hear from you. If you use my fonts for
something please send me a postcard or e-mail letting me know how
you used it. Send me a copy if you can or let me know where I can
find your work.

If you use this font for commercial purposes please credit me in
at least some little way.
