Customer shall defend MuleSoft against any third party claim that any modification or derivative work made by Customer to the Free Software infringes such third party's patent or copyright (but only to the extent that such alleged infringement would not have existed but for such modification or the creation of such derivative work), and indemnify MuleSoft from the resulting costs and damages awarded against MuleSoft; provided that MuleSoft notifies Customer promptly in writing of such claim, grants Customer sole control over the defense and settlement thereof, and reasonably cooperates with Customer's request for assistance.
