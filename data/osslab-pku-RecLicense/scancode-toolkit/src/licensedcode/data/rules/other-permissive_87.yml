notes: for a time (between 1999 and 2004) this was the license from sudo from https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/file/92712e895afb/LICENSE
    until https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/file/d8d7bfc8a18b/LICENSE e.g. this was a BSD Original/4
    clauses made into 3 clause then with a new 4th clause added borrowed from the Apache 1.1
    license. This is not worthy of being its own license entry as this is no longer in use.
