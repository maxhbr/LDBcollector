Rather, You have a license to use the API as provided in this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that Qualys owns all right, title, and interest in the API(s), the Site and the Content and You will not contest those rights or engage in any conduct contrary to those rights.

We will not share that information with a third-party or otherwise publish it. We may use the collected information for the follow-ing purposes:•Periodic pro-active scanning to have reports ready when they are requested.•Store reports on third-party systems for the purpose of caching and web site load distribution only (e.g., on a CDN).If you’re using our APIs to automate web site assessments, your IP address information will be forwarded to the tested servers. For example, for HTTP, we embed the IP address in the User-Agent request head-er. We believe this is not a privacy issue because our terms permit API usage only with scanning permis-sion. API requests that retrieve cached results won’t forward any IP address information, even if we have to initiate a new assessment because we don’t have a report ready. For more information on how to en-sure that forwarding never takes place, please refer to the SSL Labs APIs documentation. Manual web site usage will not result in your IP address being forwarded to the tested servers.QUALYS OR LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE IN-FORMATION CONTAINED ON THE SITE, THE API(S) AND/OR IN THE CONTENT.
