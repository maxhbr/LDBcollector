notes: Per Fedora, this "Cheusov variant" of the MIT "does not give explicit permission to redistribute
    unmodified copies, however, since it does give permission to "copy" unmodifed copies, we
    are interpreting it that way. Also, since it does grant explicit permission to redistribute
    modified code, we feel the intent was to grant permission to redistribute unmodified copies
    as well. That said, this license is poorly worded, and we do not recommend its use."
