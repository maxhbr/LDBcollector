 File lacks copyright and licensing, but contains the comment
 "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it" which
 might be interpreted as a copyright holder not granting a license.
 More likely, however, the header file is considered non-copyrightable
 header with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:
 .
  * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1 (according to git sources),
    together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment but
    also explicit copyright and licensing:
    <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.
 .
  * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999 (according to git sources),
    at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it> released
    audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
