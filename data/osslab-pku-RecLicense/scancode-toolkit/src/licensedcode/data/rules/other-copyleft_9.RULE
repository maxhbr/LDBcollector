Liability: Computers are complex devices with many different configurations which run in many environments. While the program works well on my computer and in my environment, I have no way to guarantee that it will work perfectly on your computer, or that it won't delete your data, cause your computer to burst into flames, create a glitch in the matrix, become sentient and lock the pod bay doors, summon Cthulu, or kill Schr√∂dinger's cat. As such, you are using this software at your own risk. But if any of these things happen, please file a bug report.
