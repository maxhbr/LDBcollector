 * The following license idents are currently accepted as indicating free
 * software modules
 *
 *  "GPL"               [GNU Public License v2]
 *  "GPL v2"            [GNU Public License v2]
 *  "GPL and additional rights" [GNU Public License v2 rights and more]
 *  "Dual BSD/GPL"          [GNU Public License v2
 *                   or BSD license choice]
 *  "Dual MIT/GPL"          [GNU Public License v2
 *                   or MIT license choice]
 *  "Dual MPL/GPL"          [GNU Public License v2
 *                   or Mozilla license choice]
 *
 * The following other idents are available
 *
 *  "Proprietary"           [Non free products]
 *
 * Both "GPL v2" and "GPL" (the latter also in dual licensed strings) are
 * merely stating that the module is licensed under the GPL v2, but are not
 * telling whether "GPL v2 only" or "GPL v2 or later". The reason why there
 * are two variants is a historic and failed attempt to convey more
 * information in the MODULE_LICENSE string. For module loading the
 * "only/or later" distinction is completely irrelevant and does neither
 * replace the proper license identifiers in the corresponding source file
 * nor amends them in any way. The sole purpose is to make the
 * 'Proprietary' flagging work and to refuse to bind symbols which are
 * exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL when a non free module is loaded.
 *
 * In the same way "BSD" is not a clear license information. It merely
 * states, that the module is licensed under one of the compatible BSD
 * license variants. The detailed and correct license information is again
 * to be found in the corresponding source files.
 *
 * There are dual licensed components, but when running with Linux it is the
 * GPL that is relevant so this is a non issue. Similarly LGPL linked with GPL
 * is a GPL combined work.
