Most source files are LGPLv2.1+ or GPLv2+, but some files are available under
more liberal licenses, such as BSD, MIT, ISC, and possibly others. Look at the
copyright header of each source file, and grep the sources for "Copyright" if
you need to know details. C source files without Copyright notice are usually
licensed as LGPLv2.1+. Also see the list of files with specific licenses below
(not all files can have a standard license header).

All new contributions must be LGPLv2.1+ licensed. Using a more liberal license
compatible to LGPLv2.1+ is also ok.

Changes done to GPL code must come with the implicit/explicit agreement that the
project can relicense the changes to LGPLv2.1+ at a later point without asking
the contributor. This is a safeguard for making potential relicensing of
remaining GPL code to LGPLv2.1+ easier.
