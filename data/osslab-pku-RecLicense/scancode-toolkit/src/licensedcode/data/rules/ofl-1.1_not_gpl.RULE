The fonts were initially published on the 6th of July 2009 on
Dave Crossland's foundry website [6] under the terms of the GNU
General Public License version 3. [7] In May 2010 the fonts were 
republished through Google Web Fonts [8] under the terms of the

development by the GNOME design community. [10]
