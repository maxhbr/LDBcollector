The FT4FP License The FT4FP project is thought to protect the rights of creative people and offers a platform to share mental property with all interested people around the globe. The FT4FP license prohibits profit oriented exploitation of mental property put under its shelter. Mental property never should be degraded to a proprietary ware, only sold to those who have the money to consume it. Knowledge and Works Of Art should not be locked in safes, where only a small group of people is allowed to access them.
