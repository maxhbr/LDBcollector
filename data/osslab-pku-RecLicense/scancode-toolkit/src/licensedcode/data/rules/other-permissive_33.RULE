The software is completely free for any purpose, unless notes at the head of
the program text indicates otherwise (which is rare). In any case, the notes
about licensing are never more restrictive than the BSD License.

In every case where the software is not written by me (Martin Porter), this
licensing arrangement has been endorsed by the contributor, and it is
therefore unnecessary to ask the contributor again to confirm it.

I have not asked any contributors (or their employers, if they have them) for
proofs that they have the right to distribute their software in this way.
