notes: Based on the MIT with material and problematic changes. Seen in https://github.com/Armoured-Egg-Official/SkyblockCF/blob/a3b13448c878bfc7b2df005941c32e198191c0af/LICENSE#L7
    and a few other places. It says "with restriction including without limitation the rights"
    instead of "without restriction including without limitation the rights" in a standard MIT.
    Since there is no way to know if this is a bona fide typo or some intentianal change this
    is reported as proprietary for now.
