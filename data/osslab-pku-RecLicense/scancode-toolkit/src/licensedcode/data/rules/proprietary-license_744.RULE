RESTRICTION ON SELLING

You may not sell the Software as a Service (SaaS) in itself, that is, you may
not sell a digital service whose main component is the Software. You may offer
such a service completely free of charge, but in that case you must contribute
any changes made to the Software back to the project. You may expressly use the
software to manage your own commercial SaaS offering without the requirement to
contribute changes back. In plain language:

- Running your own services behind apiplexy and selling them for money is okay.
- Writing your own in-house plugins for apiplexy and not sharing or contributing
  those is okay.
- Helping people set up apiplexy in-house for money is okay.
- Selling apiplexy as a service to manage other people's services for money is
  NOT okay.
- Offering apiplexy as a service (as above), but completely free of charge
  forever, is okay, but you must make your source code available.

COPYRIGHT TRANSMISSION
