   The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
   software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
   minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
   and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
   Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
   license you like.
