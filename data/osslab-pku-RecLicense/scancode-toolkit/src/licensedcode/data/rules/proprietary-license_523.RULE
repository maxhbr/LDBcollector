License Agreement:

The features set forth in this Section XIV (the "Strong Encryption
Specification") are covered by a pending patent application. Portions of
this Strong Encryption technology are available for use at no charge
under the following terms and conditions.

1. License Grant.

   a. NOTICE TO USER. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION XIV OF THE
   APPNOTE (THE "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY. BY USING ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE
   LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
   AGREEMENT AND YOU AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY
   WRITTEN NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT
   USE THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY.

   b. Definitions.

      i. "Licensed Technology" shall mean that proprietary technology now or
      hereafter owned or controlled by PKWare, Inc. ("PKWARE") or any
      subsidiary or affiliate  that covers or is necessary to be used to give
      software the ability to a) extract and decrypt data from zip files
      encrypted using any methods of data encryption and key processing which
      are published in this APPNOTE or any prior APPNOTE, as supplemented by
      any Additional Compatibility Information; and b) encrypt file contents
      as part of .ZIP file processing using only the Single Password Symmetric
      Encryption Method as published in this APPNOTE or any prior APPNOTE, as
      supplemented by any Additional Compatibility Information.  For purposes
      of this AGREEMENT, "Additional Compatibility Information" means, with
      regard to any method of data encryption and key processing published in
      this or any prior APPNOTE, any corrections, additions, or clarifications
      to the information in such APPNOTE that are required in order to give
      software the ability to successfully extract and decrypt zip files (or,
      but solely in the case of the Single Password Symmetric Encryption Method,
      to successfully encrypt zip files) in a manner interoperable with the
      actual implementation of such method in any PKWARE product that is
      documented or publicly described by PKWARE as being able to create, or
      to extract and decrypt, zip files using that method.

      ii. "Licensed Products" shall mean any products you produce that
      incorporate the Licensed Technology.

   c. License to Licensed Technology.

   PKWARE hereby grants to you a non-exclusive license to use the Licensed
   Technology for the purpose of manufacturing, offering, selling and using
   Licensed Products, which license shall extend to permit the practice of all
   claims in any patent or patent application (collectively, "Patents") now or
   hereafter owned or controlled by PKWARE in any jurisdiction in the world
   that are infringed by implementation of the Licensed Technology.  You have
   the right to sublicense rights you receive under the terms of this AGREEMENT
   for the purpose of allowing sublicensee to manufacture, offer, sell and use
   products that incorporate all or a portion of any of your Licensed Products,
   but if you do, you agree to i) impose the same restrictions on any such
   sublicensee as these terms impose on you and ii) notify the sublicensee,
   by means chosen by you in your unfettered discretion, including a notice on
   your web site, of the terms of this AGREEMENT and make available to each
   sublicensee the full text of this APPNOTE.   Further, PKWARE hereby grants to
   you a non-exclusive right to reproduce and distribute, in any form, copies of
   this APPNOTE, without modification.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
   in this AGREEMENT, you have the right to sublicense the rights, without any of
   the restrictions described above or elsewhere in this AGREEMENT, to use, offer
   to sell and sell Licensed Technology as incorporated in executable object code
   or byte code forms of your Licensed Products.  Any sublicense to use the
   Licensed Technology incorporated in a Licensed Product granted by you shall
   survive the termination of this AGREEMENT for any reason.  PKWARE warrants that
   this license shall continue to encumber the Licensed Technology regardless of
   changes in ownership of the Licensed Technology.

   d. Proprietary Notices.

      i. With respect to any Licensed Product that is distributed by you either
      in source code form or in the form of an object code library of externally
      callable functions that has been designed by you for incorporation into third
      party products, you agree to include, in the source code, or in the case of
      an object code library, in accompanying documentation, a notice using the
      words "patent pending" until a patent is issued to PKWARE covering any
      portion of the Licensed Technology or PKWARE provides notice, by means
      chosen by PKWARE in its unfettered discretion, that it no longer has any
      patent pending covering any portion of the Licensed Technology.  With respect
      to any Licensed Product, upon your becoming aware that at least one patent has
      been granted covering the Licensed Technology, you agree to include in any
      revisions made by you to the documentation (or any source code distributed
      by you) the words "Pat. No.", or "Patent Number" and the patent number or
      numbers of the applicable patent or patents.  PKWARE shall, from time to time,
      inform you of the patent number or numbers of the patents covering the
      Licensed Technology, by means chosen by PKWARE in its unfettered discretion,
      including a notice on its web site.  It shall be a violation of the terms of
      this AGREEMENT for you to sell Licensed Products without complying with the
      foregoing marking provisions.

      ii. You acknowledge that the terms of this AGREEMENT do not grant you any
      license or other right to use any PKWARE trademark in connection with the sale,
      offering for sale, distribution and delivery of the Licensed Products, or in
      connection with the advertising, promotion and offering of the Licensed Products.
      You acknowledge PKWARE's ownership of the PKZIP trademark and all other marks
      owned by PKWARE.

   e. Covenant of Compliance and Remedies.

   To the extent that you have elected to implement portions of the Licensed
   Technology, you agree to use reasonable diligence to comply with those portions
   of this Section XIV, as modified or supplemented by Additional Compatibility
   Information available to you, describing the portions of the Licensed Technology
   that you have elected to implement.  Upon reasonable request by PKWARE, you will
   provide written notice to PKWARE identifying which version of this APPNOTE you
   have relied upon for your implementation of any specified Licensed Product.

   If any substantial non-compliance with the terms of this AGREEMENT is determined
   to exist, you will make such changes as necessary to bring your Licensed Products
   into substantial compliance with the terms of this AGREEMENT.  If, within sixty
   days of receipt of notice that a Licensed Product fails to comply with the terms
   of this AGREEMENT, you fail to make such changes as necessary to bring your
   Licensed Products into compliance with the terms of this AGREEMENT, PKWARE may
   terminate your rights under this AGREEMENT.  PKWARE does not waive and expressly
   reserves the right to pursue any and all additional remedies that are or may
   become available to PKWARE.

   f. Warranty and Indemnification Regarding Exportation.

   You realize and acknowledge that, as between yourself and PKWARE, you are fully
   responsible for compliance with the import and export laws and regulations of
   any country in or to which you import or export any Licensed Products, and you
   agree to hold PKWARE harmless from any claim of violation of any such import
   or export laws.

   g. Patent Infringement.

   You agree that you will not bring or threaten to bring any action against PKWARE
   for infringement of the claims of any patent owned or controlled by you solely
   as a result of PKWARE's own implementation of the Licensed Technology.  As its
   exclusive remedy for your breach of the foregoing agreement, PKWARE reserves
   the right to suspend or terminate all rights granted under the terms of this
   AGREEMENT if you bring or threaten to bring any such action against PKWARE,
   effective immediately upon delivery of written notice of suspension or
   termination to you.

   h. Governing Law.

   The license granted in this AGREEMENT shall be governed by and construed under
   the laws of the State of Wisconsin and the United States.

   i. Revisions and Notice.

   The license granted in this APPNOTE is irrevocable, except as expressly set
   forth above.  You agree and understand that any changes which PKWARE determines
   to make to this APPNOTE shall be posted at the same location as the current
   APPNOTE or at a location which will be identified by means chosen by PKWARE,
   including a notice on its web site, and shall be available for adoption by you
   immediately upon such posting, or at such other time as PKWARE shall determine.
   Any changes to the terms of the license published in a subsequent version of
   this AGREEMENT shall be binding upon you only with respect to your products
   that (i) incorporate any Licensed Technology (as defined in the subsequent
   AGREEMENT) that is not otherwise included in the definition of Licensed
   Technology under this AGREEMENT, or (ii) that you expressly identify are to
   be licensed under the subsequent AGREEMENT, which identification shall be by
   written notice with reference to the APPNOTE (version and release date or other
   unique identifier) in which the subsequent AGREEMENT is published.  PKWARE
   agrees to identify each change to this APPNOTE by using a unique version and
   release date identifier or other unique identifier.
