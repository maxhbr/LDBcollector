notes: Per Fedora "This license contains a title preservation clause, which can literally be
    read as a purported requirement to assign copyright in derivative works upstream to OpenVision.
    However, the use of the word "retained" suggests instead that it should be read as a mere
    assertion of persistence of copyright in derivative works. Since this would automatically
    occur, as long as code persists from the original OpenVision copyrighted code base, under
    this interpretation, this becomes functionally equivalent to MIT.
