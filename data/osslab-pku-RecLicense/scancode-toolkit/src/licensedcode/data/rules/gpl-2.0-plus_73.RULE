Even though BusyBox code, as a whole, can only be used
under GPL version 2, some individual files may have more permissive licenses:
"GPL version 2 or later" - meaning that you can also reuse the code from this source file
for a project which is distributed under GPLv3, and "Public domain" -
the code in these files have no licensing restrictions whatsoever
