notes: |
    this is a rare modified Apache 2.0 license from PIXAR, reported as
    free-unknown to draw attention on its uncommon terms
    See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixarAnimationStudios/ruby-jss/master/LICENSE.txt
    When compared with the Apache-2.0 license text, section 6. Trademarks  has been modified
    to narrow the original exception of TM usage "as required for reasonable and customary use"...
