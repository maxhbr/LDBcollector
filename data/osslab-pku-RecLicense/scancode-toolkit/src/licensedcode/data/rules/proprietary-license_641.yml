notes: Based on the MIT with material and problematic changes. Seen in https://github.com/wellnotme/TUSC/blob/0cbe3141a7a879e1b1648e981f04470fc0fd4de3/reshade-shaders/Shaders/FakeMotionBlur.fx#L6
    and a few other places. It says "with restriction including without limitation the rights"
    instead of "without restriction including without limitation the rights" in a standard MIT.
    Since there is no way to know if this is a bona fide typo or some intentianal change this
    is reported as proprietary for now.
