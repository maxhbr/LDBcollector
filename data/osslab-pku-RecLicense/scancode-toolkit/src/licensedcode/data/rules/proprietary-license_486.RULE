2. The Software must not be used in the code base of HTML editors or web
builders. A HTML editor is a software (or hosted web application) that can be
used by a third party (the user of the HTML editor) to create HTML documents
that can be exported and used elsewhere. A web builder is a software (or hosted
web application) that can be used by a third party (the user of the web builder)
to create HTML documents that are hosted or dynamically generated under a top
level domain chosen by the third party. The code base is the source code of the
HTML editor or web builder, including the source code of publicly available
plugins. No calls to layerJS can be made from the code base, but third party
users can use layerJS in their websites that are built with these HTML editors
or web builders.
