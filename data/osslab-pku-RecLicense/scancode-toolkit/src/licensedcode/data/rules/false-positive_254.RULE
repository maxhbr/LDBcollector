As per http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses,

the "NCSA/University of Illinois Open Source License" is compatible
with the GPL (both version 2 and 3).  What is claimed to be
compatible is this

http://www.opensource.org/licenses/UoI-NCSA.php

and the LLVM documentation at

http://www.llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#license

says all the code in LLVM is available under the University of
Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, at this URL

http://www.opensource.org/licenses/UoI-NCSA.php

viz, the same one that the FSF pages claim is compatible.  So I
think it's OK to include it.
