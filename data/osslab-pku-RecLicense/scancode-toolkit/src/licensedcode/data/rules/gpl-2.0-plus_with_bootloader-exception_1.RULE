Bootloader Exception

In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
not linked into a combined executable.)
