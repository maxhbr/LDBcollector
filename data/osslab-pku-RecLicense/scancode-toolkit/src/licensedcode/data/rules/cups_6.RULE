     a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
        for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
        Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
        third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
        for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
        CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
        or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
        considered to be a derivative work or collective work
        based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the

        Software without releasing the source code of the

        filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop

        releases and future versions thereof.
 .
     c. This exception is only available for Apple
        OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
        that is distributed for use on other operating
        systems.
 .
     d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
        exception have the following text at the top of each
