o About Trademark

Trademark Usage Guidelines

AbiSource Trademarks

AbiSource, AbiWord, AbiCalc, AbiFile, AbiSuite, AbiShow and other
AbiSource graphics, logos and service names are trademarks of Dom
Lachowicz. These trademarks may not be used in connection with any
product or service that is not AbiSource's, in any manner that is
likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that
disparages or discredits AbiSource.

Trademarks and the GPL

AbiSource software products, such as AbiWord, are copyrighted works
released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). Verbatim copies of such works may be made and distributed, by
anyone, in accordance with the terms of the GPL without violating the
AbiSource trademarks. The GPL also grants you certain rights to make
and distribute derivative works based on the source code to AbiSource
products.

The GPL does not grant you any right to use AbiSource trademarks in
connection with these derivative works. AbiSource trademarks may not
be used in connection with any such derivative works unless that usage
is explicitly and specifically licensed, in writing, from Dom
Lachowicz.

Personal exemption

As a specific exception, AbiSource freely licenses the use of certain
of its trademarks solely in combination with the suffix "Personal"
when applied to derivative works based on an AbiSource GPL
product. Thus, for example, you are free to use the mark "AbiWord
Personal" in connection with derivative works that are based on
"AbiWord". To help maintain this distinction, AbiSource releases the
sources to its GPL products with Personal-based trademarks.

We are not lawyers

Trademark and copyright issues are, at heart, legal matters. We've
tried to keep this explanation as simple and common-sense as possible,
but if you have any questions about when and how to use AbiSource
trademarks, your best bet is to ask a lawyer. We are not lawyers.

We are not evil

Our goal is very simple. We want to make sure our software stays Open
Source, no matter what. That's why we chose the GPL. We also want
everyone to know which products are ours. That's why we are so picky
about our trademarks.

o "AbiWord" vs. "AbiWord Personal" for Debian?

Maybe this is informative for now.
