LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTY
RED HAT LINUX VERSION 

This agreement governs the use of the Software and any updates to the
Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism.  The Software is a
collective work under U.S. Copyright Law.  Subject to the following
terms, Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat) grants to the user (Customer) a
license to this collective work pursuant to the GNU General Public
License.

1.  The Software.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the Software) is a
    modular operating system consisting of hundreds of software
    components.  The end user license agreement for each component is
    located in the component's source code.  With the exception of
    certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license
    terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
    redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
    forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
    grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
    particular component.

2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
    components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
    structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
    protected under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software
    and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
    shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable
    license.  The Red Hat trademark and the Shadowman logo are
    registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries.
    This agreement does not permit Customer to distribute the Software
    using Red Hat's trademarks.  Customer should read the information
    found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
    distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
    been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
    the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
    or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
    identified as REDHAT-LOGOS and anaconda-images to remove all
    images containing the Red Hat trademark or the Shadowman logo.
    Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.

3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
    or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
    permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
    are provided and licensed as is without warranty of any kind,
    expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
    merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
    purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
    the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
    operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
    precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
    warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
    from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.

4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
    permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
    accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
    liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
    Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
    of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
    Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
    by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
    applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
    be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
    including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
    inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
    been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
    shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
    that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
    twelve months preceding the action.

5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Customer represents and
    warrants that it: (a) understands that the Software is subject to
    export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's Export
    Administration Regulations (EAR); (b) is not located in a
    prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions
    regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
    and Syria); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the
    Software to any prohibited destination, entity, or individual
    without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s) from
    the U.S. Government; (d) will not use or transfer the Software for
    use in any sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or
    missile technology end-uses unless authorized by the
    U.S. Government by regulation or specific license; (e) understands
    and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or
    transfers the Software to eligible end users, it will, as required
    by EAR Section 741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
    Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which
    include the name and address (including country) of each
    transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
    United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
    encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for
    compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.

6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software
    programs with the Software that are not part of the Software.
    These third party programs are subject to their own license terms.
    The license terms either accompany the programs or can be viewed
    at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Customer does not agree to
    abide by the applicable license terms for such programs, then
    Customer may not install them.  If Customer wishes to install the
    programs on more than one system or transfer the programs to
    another party, then Customer must contact the licensor of the
    programs.

7.  General.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be
    unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the
    remaining provisions.  This agreement shall be governed by the
    laws of the State of North Carolina and of the United States,
    without regard to any conflict of laws provisions, except that the
    United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall
    not apply.
