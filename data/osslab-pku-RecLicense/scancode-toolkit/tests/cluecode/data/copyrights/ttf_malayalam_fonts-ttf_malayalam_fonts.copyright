(Spcial note for Rachana font)

	Rachana is a language campaign forum for the Original script of Malayalam
	in the digital computing. It started in 1999 under the leadership of
	R. Chitrajakumar (Malayalam Lexicon, Kerala University, Palayalm,
	Thiruvananthapuram). Hussain KH (KFRI, Kerala Forest Research Institute,
	Peechi, Thrissur) is the project coordinator who designed the font.
	Other Members are:  Gangadharan N (Malayalam Lexicon) who assisted
	Chitrajakumar in compiling the exhaustive character set of Malayalam;
	Dr. P Vijayakumaran Nair (KFRI) who assisted in programming the Rachana
	text editor which was used by many from 1999 to 2005 to typeset Books
	and journal articles in the old Lipi; Subash Kuriakose (KFRI) who gave
	advice to Hussain in the many aspects of Malayalam calligraphy. Later in
	2004 Rajeev J Sebastian joined the Rachana team, whose mastery in Linux
	and untiring work is elevating the campaign to materialize its highest
	dream that to embed the original script in the OS enabling it in the
	whole field of digital applications. Dr. Mammen Chundamannil (KFRI) is
	an ardent supporter and well wisher of Rachana whose article 'For our
	language, our script' has spread the vision and objectives of Rachana to
	the whole world.

	There seems to be some confusion regarding the license of Rachana.
	Praveen has confirmed that Rachana is indeed under GPL. Any queries
	regarding the exact status of Rachana license issue should be directed
	to Praveen <pravi.a@gmail.com>
