# This script attempts to guess a canonical system name similar to
# config.sub.  If it succeeds, it prints the system name on stdout, and
# exits with 0.  Otherwise, it exits with 1.
#
# The plan is that this can be called by configure scripts if you
# don't specify an explicit build system type.

# me=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's,.*/,,'`

# usage="\
# Usage: $0 [OPTION]

# Output the configuration name of the system \`$me' is run on.

# Operation modes:
#   -h, --help         print this help, then exit
#   -t, --time-stamp   print date of last modification, then exit
#   -v, --version      print version number, then exit

# CC_FOR_BUILD -- compiler used by this script. Note that the use of a
# compiler to aid in system detection is discouraged as it requires
# temporary files to be created and, as you can see below, it is a
# headache to deal with in a portable fashion.

# Historically, `CC_FOR_BUILD' used to be named `HOST_CC'. We still
# use `HOST_CC' if defined, but it is deprecated.

# Portable tmp directory creation inspired by the Autoconf team.
