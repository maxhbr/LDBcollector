# order to be recognized.  For example, each of these is fine:
#
#   Copyright @copyright{} 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
#   Foundation, Inc.
#
#   # Copyright (C) 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
#   # Foundation, Inc.
#
#   /*
#    * Copyright &copy; 90,2005,2007-2009
#    * Free Software Foundation, Inc.
#    */
#
# However, the following format is not recognized because the line
# prefix changes after the first line:
#
#   ## Copyright (C) 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
#   #  Foundation, Inc.
#
# However, any correctly formatted copyright statement following
# a non-matching copyright statements would be recognized.
#
#   2. Its format is "Copyright (C)", then a list of copyright years,
#      and then the name of the copyright holder.
#   3. The "(C)" takes one of the following forms or is omitted
#      entirely:
#
#        A. (C)
#        B. (c)
#        C. @copyright{}
#        D. &copy;
#        E. Â©
#
#   4. The "Copyright" appears at the beginning of a line, except that it
#      may be prefixed by any sequence (e.g., a comment) of no more than
#      5 characters -- including white space.
