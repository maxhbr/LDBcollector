Everything should remain the same, including $Revision: 1196 $ and $Date: 2008-06-08 17:55:42 +0000 (So, 08. Jun 2008) $ (I know these may look funny but they have their purpose for those of you who don't know about SVN).

Also: I'm not sure about the copyright on a new language file. I'm not a lawyer, could someone contact me about whether the copyright for a new language file should be exclusivly the authors, or joint with me (if included in a GeSHi release)?
