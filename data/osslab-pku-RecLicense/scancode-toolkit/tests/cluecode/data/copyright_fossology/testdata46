This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU Bash,
the Bourne Again SHell.

This package was put together by Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>, from
the following sources:

  bash:			ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/bash/bash-3.2.tar.gz
  bashdb:		http://bashdb.sf.net/

Bash homepage:		 http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/bash/bashtop.html

The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.

  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
	references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
	now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
	added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
	Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
