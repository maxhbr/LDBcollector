This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the grep program.
Currently Anibal Monsalve Salazar <anibal@debian.org> maintains the
Debian GNU/Linux version of grep.

Robert van der Meulen <rvdm@debian.org> and
Ryan M. Golbeck <rmgolbeck@debian.org>
were the previous maintainers.

This package was created from the grep sources as found on the GNU
mirrors. grep.texi file was removed since it is not DFSG compliant
