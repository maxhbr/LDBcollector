Len Tower, and Paul Eggert</s>.  Wayne Davison designed and implemented
the unified output format. GNU `diff3' was <s>written by Randy Smith</s>.
GNU `sdiff' was <s>written by Thomas Lord</s>.  GNU `cmp' was <s>written by
Torbjorn Granlund and David MacKenzie</s>.

The source for this release was obtained from

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/diffutils/diffutils-2.8.1.tar.gz

The Debian .orig.tar.gz is a repackaged version of the above, with
the following changes:

* The doc directory, which contains the manual, has been removed.
* The files `Makefile.in', `configure.ac' and `configure' have been modified
  minimally so that the tarball may be used without any of the auto* tools
  (as it also happens for the unmodified tarball).
