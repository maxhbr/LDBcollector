This is Debian GNU's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU ed
utility.  The classic unix line editor, ed is a line-oriented text
editor.  It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise
manipulate text files.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from the GNU sources, which I obtained from:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ed/ed-0.7.tar.bz2

The changes were small:

o adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
o buf.c (open_sbuf): use tmpfile() and not mktemp().
o glbl.c (exec_global), io.c (read_stream, get_stream_line), main.c
  (main, exec_command, get_matching_node_addr, strip_escapes), re.c
  (get_compiled_pattern), sub.c (extract_subst_template, 
  substitute_matching_text): parentheses to quiet -Wall.
o ed.1: various fixes by Matt Kraai <kraai@alumni.carnegiemellon.edu>
