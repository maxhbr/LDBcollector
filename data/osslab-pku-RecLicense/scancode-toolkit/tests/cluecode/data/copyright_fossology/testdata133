The ImageMagick logo is copyright Pineapple USA Inc. It is freely
distributable, however, modifications to the logo are not permitted.

Debian does not distribute the original ImageMagick logo in either the
orig.tar.gz or the binary packages because of this. All instances of
it have been deleted, and the code instances replaced with a generic
text logo with the Debian open use logo.
