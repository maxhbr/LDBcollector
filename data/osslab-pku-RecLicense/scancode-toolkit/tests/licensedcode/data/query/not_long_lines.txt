     He hath a garden circummured with brick,
    Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
    And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
    That makes his opening with this bigger key:
    This other doth command a little door
    Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
    There have I made my promise
    Upon the heavy middle of the night
    To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA

    I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
    With whispering and most guilty diligence,
    In action all of precept, he did show me
    The way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Are there no other tokens
    Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA

    No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
    And that I have possess'd him my most stay
    Can be but brief; for I have made him know
    I have a servant comes with me along,
    That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
    I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis well borne up.
    I have not yet made known to Mariana
    A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!

    Re-enter MARIANA
    I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
    She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA

    I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA

    Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
    Who hath a story ready for your ear.
    I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
    The vaporous night approaches.
