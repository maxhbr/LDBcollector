# This script attempts to guess a canonical system name similar to
# config.sub.  If it succeeds, it prints the system name on stdout, and
# exits with 0.  Otherwise, it exits with 1.
#
# The plan is that this can be called by configure scripts if you
# don't specify an explicit build system type.
