This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the GNU Pascal compiler in the
same source package.  Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  http://gnu-pascal.de/alpha/          (for GNU Pascal)
  http://dgcc.sourceforge.net/         (for D)

The current gcc-4.3 source package is taken from the SVN trunk.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-4.3          libgnat-4.3        gnat-4.3-doc
C              gcc-4.3                              gcc-4.3-doc
C++            g++-4.3           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-4.3-doc
D              gdc-4.3
Fortran 95     gfortran-4.3      libgfortran3       gfortran-4.3-doc
Java           gcj-4.3           libgcj9            libgcj-doc
Objective C    gobjc-4.3         libobjc2
Objective C++  gobjc++-4.3
Pascal         gpc-4.3
Treelang       treelang-4.3

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources     Development  Debugging           Position-Independent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                libstdc++6-4.3-dbg  libstdc++6-4.3-pic
Java      libgcj9-src libgcj9-dev  libgcj9-dbg

Additional packages include:

gcc-4.3-base                    Base files common to all compilers

gcc-4.3-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnatvsn-dev, libgnatvsn4.3   GNAT version library
libgnatprj-dev, libgnatprj4.3   GNAT Project Manager library

C:

libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files
protoize                        Create/remove ANSI prototypes from C code

Java:
gij                             The Java bytecode interpreter and VM
libgcj-common                   Common files for the Java run-time
libgcj8-awt                     The Abstract Windowing Toolkit
libgcj8-jar                     Java ARchive for the Java run-time

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.
