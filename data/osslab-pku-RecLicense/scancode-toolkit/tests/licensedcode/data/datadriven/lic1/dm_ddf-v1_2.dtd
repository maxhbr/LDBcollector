<!-- The node element is recursive, a Node with a Value tag MUST always terminate the recursion. It is possible for a Node to omit both the next recursive Node and a Value, this means that the hierarchy of Nodes continues elsewhere. This can be used to increase readability of very deep trees.-->
<!ELEMENT Node (NodeName, Path?, RTProperties?, DFProperties?, (Node* | Value?))>
<!--NodeName MUST be present but may be empty. If empty this means that the name is set when the node is created-->
<!ELEMENT NodeName (#PCDATA)>
<!--Path may be omitted. If omitted it means that the actual Path MUST be constructed from the Path and NodeName values of all ancestral nodes.-->
<!ELEMENT Path (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Value (#PCDATA)>
<!--RTProperties=Run Time Properties. Properties that exists at run-time in a device. Each node may have a different set of RTProperties. A node that only supports the mandatory properties and does not need any default values for any property and may omit the RTProperties-->
<!ELEMENT RTProperties (ACL?, Format?, Name?, Size?, Title?, TStamp?, Type, VerNo?)>
<!--It is possible to indicate that a property has a default value by inserting the value as PCDATA. This does not apply to the Format property, which MUST use one of the enumerated values. The presence of a property tag, with or without value, indicates that this property is supported. -->

When the Type element is used in the DFProperties element, it may contain a list of several MIME types that the node can support at runtime. At run-time the Type property can only have one value at a time. For interior nodes the Type element MAY contain the name of a management object identifier describing the object rooted at this location. If it does not contain a management object identifier name the value MUST be null.-->
