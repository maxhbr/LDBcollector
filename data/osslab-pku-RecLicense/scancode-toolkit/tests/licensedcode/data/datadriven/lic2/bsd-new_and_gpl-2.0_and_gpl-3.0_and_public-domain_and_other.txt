<h3><a name="license">BusyBox is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2</a></h3>

<p>BusyBox is licensed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">
the GNU General Public License version 2</a>, which is often abbreviated as GPLv2.
(This is the same license the Linux kernel is under, so you may be somewhat
familiar with it by now.)</p>

<p>A complete copy of the license text is included in the file LICENSE in
the BusyBox source code.</p>

<p><a href="products.html">Anyone thinking of shipping BusyBox as part of a
product</a> should be familiar with the licensing terms under which they are
allowed to use and distribute BusyBox.  Read the full text of the GPL (either
through the above link, or in the file LICENSE in the BusyBox tarball), and
also read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">Frequently
Asked Questions about the GPL</a>.</p>

<p>If you distribute GPL-licensed software the license requires that you also
distribute the source code to that GPL-licensed software.  If you distribute
BusyBox without making the source code to the version you distribute available,
you violate the license terms, and thus infringe on the copyrights of BusyBox.
This requirement applies whether or not you modified BusyBox; either way the
license terms still apply to you.</p>

<h3><a name="enforce">License enforcement</a></h3>

<p>BusyBox's copyrights are enforced by the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law Center</a>
(you can contact them at gpl@busybox.net), which
"accepts primary responsibility for enforcement of US copyrights on the
software... and coordinates international copyright enforcement efforts for
such works as necessary."  If you distribute BusyBox in a way that doesn't
comply with the terms of the license BusyBox is distributed under, expect to
hear from these guys.  Their entire reason for existing is to do pro-bono
legal work for free/open source software projects.  We used to list people who
violate the BusyBox license in <a href="shame.html">The Hall of Shame</a>,
but these days we find it much more effective to hand them over to the
lawyers.</p>

<p>Our enforcement efforts are aimed at bringing people into compliance with
the BusyBox license.  Open source software is under a different license from
proprietary software, but if you violate that license you're still a software
pirate and the law gives the vendor (us) some big sticks to play with.  We
don't want monetary awards, injunctions, or to generate bad PR for a company,
unless that's the only way to get somebody that repeatedly ignores us to comply
with the license on our code.</p>


<h3>My company wants to include BusyBox into a product.
What do we need to do in order to comply with BusyBox's license?</h3>

<p>First: DON'T PANIC. Complying with BusyBox's license is easy.
Complying with BusyBox's license doesn't cost any money.
If, after reading the license and this document something is not clear
to you, please send emails with your questions to the BusyBox mailing lists.
We will expand this document to cover them.

<p>If you are distributing the BusyBox binary, you also have to distribute
the corresponding source code. If you modified the source, you have to
distribute the modified source.

<p>The text of the license obliges you to provide source code for binaries you
distribute, and gives you exactly three options for providing source code.
These options are spelled out in section 3 of the LICENSE file in the BusyBox
source tarball:

<p>3A) bundle the complete corresponding source with the binary.

<p>3B) bundle a written offer good for three years to provide source upon request
(these days this is often a URL).

<p>3C) point you users at the upstream source (i.e. pass along somebody else's 3B
offer).

<p>Using option 3A, that is, putting exact BusyBox source and .config file
you used to build the binary on the same medium which you use to ship
the binary, is the most bullet-proof approach to license compliance.
If you do that, you can stop reading, your license obligations
have been satisfied.

<p>Option 3B makes sense if you do not distribute BusyBox binaries on a medium
like CD-ROM, but instead ship them in a device's firmware.
Storing the source there might be an unacceptable waste of space.
In this case, add a note to the device's documentation that it uses
open-source components and that their source can be downloaded
from the company's website. Give exact URL to the page where it can be downloaded.

<p>Regardless of whether you use option 3A or 3B, please make sure
you distribute the <em>exact</em> same source tree you used to build the binary.
It doesn't have to be a single archive. Indeed, most people distribute modified
sources in the form of unmodified busybox-N.N.N.tar.bz2 archive
and a set of patches which add features or fix problems.

<p>If you added an applet, or an option to one of the applets in BusyBox,
or fixed a bug, and the source tree lacks this addition or fix,
then you are not fulfilling GPLv2 requirements.

<p>You can avoid having to distribute source by taking option 3C.
However, option 3C has some restrictions, and if your company wants to be
paranoid and be 100% sure everything is crystal clear about complying with
the license, perhaps it should use options 3A or 3B.


<h3>Option 3C: using unmodified source</h3>

<p>Option 3C is what most open source people use, and it's so lenient lots of
developers don't even think about it. Technically 3C is also full of
restrictions (it's "allowed only for noncommercial distribution", and it only
applies if you're redistributing a binary you didn't build yourself) intended
to push people to use 3A or 3B, but the BusyBox project has generally let
those restrictions slide (as has most of the rest of the open source world)
when dealing with people who are acting in good faith.

<p>Using option 3C means identifying the specific version of the public source
you used, where to get it from, and confirming that your binary was built from
unmodified "vanilla" sources.

<p>So if you built an unmodified BusyBox release and you point people at the URL
to the SPECIFIC source tarball on busybox.net you built it from and truthfully
say "that's it, no patches", we've accepted that as compliance even from
commercial companies. (We're not really interested in forcing random strangers
to mirror stuff we've already got. OSUOSL provides very nice high bandwidth
hosting for us, and if they didn't there's always sourceforge and savannah and
ibiblio and kernel.org and...)

<p>Note that you must do all three parts: what version did you use, where can we
get it from, and explicitly state that you did not modify it.  Don't skip
steps.

<p>If you don't specify your version, we can't tell if you used some random git
snapshot out of the development branch that was close to a release version but
not quite.

<p>If you don't explicitly say you didn't modify it, we could spend weeks combing
through an assembly dump of your binary, or trying to find the exact cross-compiler
version you used to produce a byte-for-byte identical file, but the
license says we shouldn't have to. Proving a negative is a lot of work, and
making us do this work would be shirking your obligations under GPLv2.

<p>Even if you just backported changes out of the development branch, that's not
a vanilla unmodified release.  The component parts may already be public, but
you have to give us enough information to understand what you did, and the
opportunity to produce an equivalent binary from that source, or you're not
complying with 3C.

<p>The above is a fairly lenient interpretation of GPLv2 that works a bit like
the BSD license's "advertising clause": that one required you to thank the
University of California, this one requires you to identify the specific source
code of the GPL binaries you distributed. The GPL actually allows us to be
more draconian than this (for starters, clause 3C doesn't have to apply to
commercial companies at all), but as long as everybody's acting in good faith
most projects seem happy with just identifying the specific source for binaries
built from an unmodified upstream version.

<p>Most open source developers are lenient in this way because we actually prefer
a good 3C compliance to a bad 3A compliance.  We've all received tarballs of
who knows what old version, with who knows what changes, and wasted an
afternoon proving that "this is basically source control commit number BLAH,
plus backports of commits blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah, plus they
commented out these five lines, changed two default values that they could have
overridden from the command line anyway, and added some debug statements."
I.E. we just wasted three hours confirming there's nothing remotely interesting
here that we didn't already know.

<p>Obviously if you did modify the source to the binary you distributed, and you
don't think you need to at least provide us a <em>patch</em>, you've missed the point
of GPLv2 entirely. This is another incentive to get your patch merged, so you
can ship a vanilla upstream version and not have to host your patch on your
own website for 3 years after you stop distributing your product.

<p>The next paragraph right after 3C essentially says you're supposed to give us
your .config file as well, and sometimes we've asked for that as long as we're
contacting people anyway. But to be honest, if we don't need to contact you to
get the other stuff anyway, we seldom bother. (We can generally figure that one
out for ourselves. I note that Linux kernel .configs are harder to reverse
engineer, for that you'll probably need to provide a .config for to make the
developers happy, but they put in a /proc/config.gz option to make it easy. :)


<h3>My company was distributing BusyBox binary without the source.
We are contacted by users asking for the source, and we don't have it.
Are we in trouble?</h3>

<p>Not yet. But please stop doing that, and start distributing the source.

<p>The above is what happens when people are acting in good faith.  I note
that the GPL imposes upon you the obligation to provide source code
<em>when you distribute</em>.  Whether you're using 3A, 3B, or 3C, they all
start "Accompany it with", meaning source goes with binary at time of
distribution.  So if we get the binary from you and there's no <em>mention</em> of
source code, your distribution of that binary didn't comply with the terms of
the license.  At that point, you're already in breach of the license terms,
and it's now about <em>fixing</em> it.  So if we have to approach you after the fact
to get this information, we have the option to be really nasty about it.

<p>We're not <em>required</em> to be nasty, and we prefer not to.  An honest mistake
that a company is willing to fix is understandable, and as far as I know
we've always started out with "excuse me, could you fix this please" and not
made a fuss.  Most of the time, it doesn't go beyond that, we get back an
email "oh, sorry, it's version blah, and here's the three line patch we used
to change a default value", and we're happy.

<p>And some companies are disorganized but honest about it, and go "um, we lost
track of this information and the guy who did it left the company, can you
give us some time to dig it out of the archives?"  And if they're making an
honest effort, we're polite about that too.


<h3>My company was distributing BusyBox binary without the source.
We are contacted by <em>your lawyers</em>. Are we in trouble?</h3>

<p>Yes, but it is not too bad yet. Stop being disorganized and fix
your licensing situation before it gets really nasty.
As I already mentioned, DON'T PANIC. Complying with BusyBox's license is easy.
Get your act together, fight with internal inertia inside your company
and it will be okay.
If you do not understand something, please send emails with your
questions to the BusyBox mailing lists, or privately to maintainers
if you want to keep it private. We will expand this document to cover them.

<p>However, you really cannot afford to be careless about complying with
the license anymore.

<p>Some companies ignore the polite requests entirely, and go all deer in the
headlights on us, or maybe hope that if they ignore us long enough we'll go
away.  Those are the ones that the SFLC sends <em>impolite</em> requests to, asking
for far more than the original request did back when they were being nice.

<p>For starters, if the SFLC has to actually sue someone to get their attention,
they bill them for expenses.  (They have an office in New York City, you
<em>really</em> don't want to go there).  Also, they usually make the company appoint
an "open source compliance officer" and deliver quarterly reports.  And make
them try to contact the old customers they shipped product to without source
and let them know where the source is.  All this is the lawyerly equivalent
of "raising your voice to be heard".  I've only seem them take the gloves off
once.  They've only <em>needed</em> to once.

<p>Some companies get in trouble because although they use an upstream
vanilla source tarball, they don't say what version it was, or they don't
explicitly say it wasn't modified.  Then when we approach them for more
information, they don't understand what we could possibly want, and panic.
(Panicing bad.  Please don't panic, this is actually pretty easy to get
right.  Ignoring repeated polite requests is not going to end well.  Please
be polite <em>back</em>.  Ask for clarification if you don't understand something,
it's not an admission of weakness.  If you ignore us until we stop knocking,
these days it may mean we're getting the battering ram.  This is not an
improvement for anyone concerned.)

<p>Another common failure mode is companies that redistribute some vendor board
support package they bought, and when we ask them they brush us off with "we
got it from a vendor, go bug our vendor, not our problem".  Dude, you're
copying and distributing GPL code too.  If the license is the only thing that
gives you permission to do that, then that license applies to you too.
Really.  If your vendor complied with the license terms but you didn't,
you're not off the hook.  This is not a scavenger hunt, nor is it the episode
of M*A*S*H about getting tomato juice to Colonel Potter.  We asked <em>you</em>, and
you have an obligation to provide this information.  If you don't even know
what it <em>is</em> when we ask, something is <em>wrong</em>.  If you'd reprinted somebody
else's documentation and stripped out BSD advertising clause notices, do you
think you could then say "but the original PDF we got from our vendor had the
notice in it, so we're ok, don't bother us"?  Or would going "oops, here's
one with the right data" be <em>your</em> responsibility?  Fixing this is not <em>our</em>
job.  "We ask, you answer" is us being <em>lenient</em>, the license technically
says we shouldn't have had to ask in the first place, you were supposed to
provide this info when you shipped.  And even if we're letting you delegate
the implementation, you can't delegate the <em>responsibility</em>.  Don't make me
look up how to spell "fiduciary".  (And delegating it to <em>nobody</em> really
isn't a solution.  Asking us to track down an ex-employee of a defunct
Taiwanese company where nobody spoke English just <em>doesn't go over well</em>...)

<p>Sorry about that.  Scars from the "hall of shame" days.  We have lawyers now.
They're very nice.  Where was I?

<p>A company that wants to be legally paranoid will make a source CD for the GPL
portions of their entire product (build scripts, cross compiler toolchains,
and all), and either include the CD in the box with the product (clause 3A)
or put the ISO up on the web and mention the URL to it in their product's
documentation (clause 3B).  They don't need our say-so to be satisfied with
that, even a strict reading of GPLv2 says that complies with the license
terms.  (You can probably even email the SFLC guys about what exactly should
go on the CD, gpl@busybox.net)  This is the "make it go away" preemptive
nuclear strike approach, and probably a good idea for Fortune 500 companies
that have their own legal department to do <em>anyway</em>.


<h3><a name="good">A Good Example</a></h3>

<p>These days, <a href="http://www.linksys.com/">Linksys</a> is
doing a good job at complying with the GPL, they get to be an
example of how to do things right.  Please take a moment and
check out what they do with
<!-- old link: http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1115416836002&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper" -->
<a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/gpl">
distributing the firmware for their WRT54G Router.</a>
Following their example would be a fine way to ensure that you
have also fulfilled your licensing obligations.


<h3>Add yourself to the Products page</h3>

<p>We (BusyBox developers) would be happy to add the information about your
product which uses BusyBox to our Products page. In order to be added there,
post a message to the BusyBox mailing list when the product ships.
While at it, the following information would cover the GPL licensing questions
about the product:

<p>A) a description of the product (including the build environment: processor
type, libc version, kernel version).

<p>B) identify the specific version of BusyBox it uses.

<p>C) identify any modifications made to that version (either by linking to a
nicely broken up series of "diff -u" patches on the web, or attaching the
patches to the message, or explicitly saying it isn't modified).

<p>D) attach (or give URL to) the .config file you used to build the BusyBox binary.

<p>E) A link to your website.

<p>This is the "being nice to the developers" approach, which acts as a sort of
free advertising within the developer community.

<p>You really can't go wrong with either approach: you can obey the letter of the
license according to a strict reading, or you can make the developers as
happy as possible so they not only have no reason to make trouble, but
actually like you.  (Heck, we won't complain if you do both. :)


<h3><a name="version">Developer's note: GPL versions</a></h3>

<p>Version 2 of the GPL is the only version of the GPL which current versions
of BusyBox may be distributed under.  New code added to the tree is licensed
GPL version 2, and the project's license is GPL version 2.</p>

<p>If you are a developer and you want to use a small part of BusyBox
source code in your project, please check the header comments of the source file(s)
you are taking code from. Even though BusyBox code, as a whole, can only be used
under GPL version 2, some individual files may have more permissive licenses:
"GPL version 2 or later" - meaning that you can also reuse the code from this source file
for a project which is distributed under GPLv3, and "Public domain" -
the code in these files have no licensing restrictions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Historical details:</p>

<p>Older versions of BusyBox (versions 1.2.2 and earlier, up through about svn
16112) included variants of the recommended
"GPL version 2 or (at your option) later versions" boilerplate
permission grant.  Ancient versions of BusyBox
(before svn 49) did not specify any version at all, and section 9 of GPLv2
(the most recent version at that time) says those old versions may be
redistributed under any version of GPL (including the obsolete V1).  This was
conceptually similar to a dual license, except that the different licenses were
different versions of the GPL.</p>

<p>However, BusyBox has apparently always contained chunks of code that were
licensed under GPL version 2 only.  Examples include applets written by Linus
Torvalds (util-linux/mkfs_minix.c and util_linux/mkswap.c) which stated they
"may be redistributed as per the Linux copyright" (which Linus
clarified in the
2.4.0-pre8 release announcement in 2000 was GPLv2 only), and Linux kernel code
copied into libbb/loop.c (after Linus's announcement).  There are probably
more, because all we used to check was that the code was GPL, not which
version.  (Before the GPLv3 draft proceedings in 2006, it was a purely
theoretical issue that didn't come up much.)</p>

<p>To summarize: every version of BusyBox may be distributed under the terms of
GPL version 2.  New versions (after 1.2.2), as a whole, may <b>only</b>
be distributed under GPLv2, not under other versions of the GPL.
Older versions of BusyBox might (or might not) be distributable under
other versions of the GPL.  If you want to use a GPL version other than 2,
you should start with one of the old versions such as release 1.2.2 or svn 16112,
and do your own homework to identify and remove any code that can't be
licensed under the GPL version you want to use.
New development is all GPLv2.</p>
