We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public
domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source
code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including
the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask
that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean
that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your
programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output,
please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask
that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and
expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
