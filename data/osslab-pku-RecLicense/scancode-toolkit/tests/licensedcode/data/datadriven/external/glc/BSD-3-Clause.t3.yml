notes: |
  License test derived from a file of the BSD-licensed repository at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/licensecheck/v0.3.1/testdata/BSD-3-Clause.t3
  originally expected to be detected as BSD-3-Clause
  with coverage of 100.0
  This says "Neither the copyright holder nor the names of"
  instead of "Neither the name of ...".
  It also drops "OR CONTRIBUTORS" from the end, just before "BE LIABLE", hence only of a BSD-3-Clause.
