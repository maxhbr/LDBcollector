// WARNING: JSLint will hurt your feelings.

// JSLINT is a global function. It takes two parameters.

//     var myResult = JSLINT(source, option);

// The first parameter is either a string or an array of strings. If it is a
// string, it will be split on '\n' or '\r'. If it is an array of strings, it
// is assumed that each string represents one line. The source can be a
// JavaScript text, or HTML text, or a JSON text, or a CSS text.

// The second parameter is an optional object of options that control the
// operation of JSLINT. Most of the options are booleans: They are all
// optional and have a default value of false. One of the options, predef,
// can be an array of names, which will be used to declare global variables,
// or an object whose keys are used as global names, with a boolean value
// that determines if they are assignable.

// If it checks out, JSLINT returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// If false, you can inspect JSLINT.errors to find out the problems.
// JSLINT.errors is an array of objects containing these properties:

//  {
//      line      : The line (relative to 0) at which the lint was found
//      character : The character (relative to 0) at which the lint was found
//      reason    : The problem
//      evidence  : The text line in which the problem occurred
//      raw       : The raw message before the details were inserted
//      a         : The first detail
//      b         : The second detail
//      c         : The third detail
//      d         : The fourth detail
//  }

// If a stopping error was found, a null will be the last element of the
// JSLINT.errors array. A stopping error means that JSLint was not confident
// enough to continue. It does not necessarily mean that the error was
// especially heinous.

// You can request a data structure that contains JSLint's results.

//     var myData = JSLINT.data();
