  License test derived from a file of the BSD-licensed repository at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/licensecheck/v0.3.1/testdata/ISC.t3
  originally expected to be detected as ISC
  with coverage of 100.0
  This is missing the copyright lines, which used to make the blank loop
  in license.go infinite loop.
