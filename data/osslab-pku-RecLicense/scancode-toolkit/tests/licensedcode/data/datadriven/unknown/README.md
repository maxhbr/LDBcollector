# Metafour’s Logistics Applications Terms of Use

## 1. Terms of use
These terms of use apply to all Metafour applications and by using the applications you agree to abide by them. Metafour may change these terms from time to time.
## 2. Copyright
The applications are owned or licensed by Metafour and are protected by copyright. None of the application may be copied or reproduced for commercial purposes without Metafour’s prior written consent.
## 3. Your use of the software
You may only use the application for lawful purposes.

You may not use the application to process offensive, obscene, discriminatory or indecent material. You may not use the application to send unsolicited “nuisance” emails. You must use the application in accordance with applicable legislation, including the GDPR.

Metafour may suspend or terminate access at its sole discretion without prior notice if we determine that you have violated these terms of use or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the application.
## 4. Accounts, passwords and security
Use of the application requires you to have a user account protected by authentication (for example, a user name and password).

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the authentication and for all activity that occurs under your account as a result of your failing to keep these details secure. You may not allow anybody else to user your account. You must notify Metafour immediately of any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security. 

Metafour is not liable for loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations and you may be held liable for losses incurred by Metafour as a result of your failing to keep your account authentication confidential.
## 5. Privacy
Metafour takes the privacy of your data seriously and works hard to ensure that it is protected in accordance with the GDPR.

Data is stored and processed to facilitate the processing of logistics shipments and is retained only for as long as Metafour deems necessary for that purpose.

Metafour transfers data to individuals and organisations in your supply chain, including the sender and consignee. The data recipients may be located in another country.

The application utilises automated decision making and profiling to facilitate efficient and cost-effective processing.

We may use cookies to collect information about your computer (including your IP address, operating system and browser type) for system administration and in order to create reports. This is statistical data about our user’s browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual.

Metafour may disclose information we have about you if we determine that: a) such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the application; or b) applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection purposes.

## 7. Disclaimers
Metafour works continually to improve the application and we publish enhancements without notice. 

We implement strong test procedures before software is released but cannot guarantee that the application is error-free; the application is provided on an "as-is" and “as-available" basis.

Metafour cannot guarantee that any data you download from the software will be free of viruses, contamination or destructive features.

Metafour’s liability for damage caused by any failure of performance, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay, computer virus or unauthorised access, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action, is limited to the remedies set out in Metafour’s Terms & Conditions of Supply with the organisation who pays for the use of the application.
## 8. Feedback and Information
Any feedback you provide to Metafour shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Metafour shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis unless you request otherwise.
## 9. Governing law
All matters relating to your use of the application shall be governed by the laws of the UK. Any claim under these terms of use must be brought within one year after the cause of action arises.
