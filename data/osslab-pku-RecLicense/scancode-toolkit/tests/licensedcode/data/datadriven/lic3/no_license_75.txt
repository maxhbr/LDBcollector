       Contributing to the Internet Software Consortium DHCP Dis­
       tribution

EEXXHHOORRTTAATTIIOONN
       The Internet Software  Consortium  DHCP  Distribution  has
       historically  been  funded through the donation of various
       charitable and non-charitable organizations, as well as by
       individual contributions.  To some degree, support for the
       distribution has been done on a volunteer  basis,  but  by
       and  large  the  reason that you have this distribution in
       your hands right now is because people like you have  pro­
       vided funding for it.

       We would like to encourage you to continue to provide such
       support, or to begin providing it if you have not  in  the
       past.    You  are in no way obliged to provide us with any
       support at all, and this message is not intended to guilt-
       trip  you  about providing support.   If you choose not to
       provide support, for whatever reason, you aren't going  to
       be  treated  differently  on  the  mailing lists, and your
       requests for features aren't going to be  prioritized  any
       differently.    If you want to be treated differently, you
       can buy a formal support contract,  of  course,  but  this
       document is about contributions, not support contracts.

       Q: So if I won't be treated differently, why contribute?

       A:  The  obvious  answer  is  self-interest.   If you con­
       tribute, it means that the author will have time  to  work
       on  stuff that's not of the utmost high priority.   People
       are constantly asking for things that we would really like
       to provide, but for which we have no time.   By contribut­
       ing, you are literally giving us time to do these  things.
       The  amount  of  time  varies  with  the  contribution, of
       course, but if everybody contributes a little bit, it  can
       add up to a lot.

       Q: But everybody isn't required to contribute.   If I con­
       tribute and nobody else does, doesn't that make me kind of
       a sucker?

       A:  Obviously, we don't think so, but think about this: if
       you contribute, then we can point out to others that we've
       received  contributions,  and  this  will make the idea of
       contributing seem more legitimate to them, making it  more
       likely  that  they will contribute.   So your contribution
       has more value than just the money you provide -  it  also
       helps us to raise funds from others.

       Q: If I contribute, I want a say in what work gets done.

       A:  We  do  sell  support  contracts,  and we will also do



                                                                1

       development work on specification if we feel it  is  rele­
       vant  (although  you  won't  get to own it).   This can be
       quite expensive, though - much more than even the  maximum
       we'd  expect  you to donate.   So no, contributing doesn't
       buy you a say in what work gets done.

       Q: I work for a charity that feeds the homeless.    Should
       my charity contribute?

       A: Absolutely not!   The idea here is not to take food out
       of the mouths of poor people.   If donating  to  us  would
       mean that somebody in need that you could have helped will
       go without help, keep the money.  It's not worth it to us.
       This  goes  for  providing shelter, psychiatric aid, legal
       assistance, and any other similar charity work.

       Q: Cool!   I work for a university, helping  students  who
       are  in  need of an education, so we shouldn't contribute,
       right?

       A: No, that's not quite what we mean.  Sure, if  you  work
       for  an organization that provides free education to needy
       people, at whatever level, then we'd rather you  did  that
       than  support us.  But if your university has a big budget
       for running the computer center, can afford to plant  nice
       gardens  and  maintain  nice  lawns, and maybe has all its
       dorms wired for ethernet, then even if you  qualify  as  a
       nonprofit  under federal law (or the law in your own coun­
       try) you should still contribute.  DHCP is just as much  a
       part of your infrastructure as your campus wiring.

       Q:  This  software came on a CD that I bought.   Haven't I
       already contributed?

       A: If you're seeing this notice,  and  you  didn't  see  a
       notice  saying  that  the people who sold you your CD con­
       tributed to us, then no, you haven't already  contributed.
       In  general,  we encourage people to include this software
       on their distributions if they feel it  would  be  useful,
       and  we  do not require them to contribute in exchange for
       that privilege.

       Q: I've contributed to the development of this software by
       submitting  bug  reports  and patches.   Why should I also
       contribute money?

       A: When you contributed these bug reports and patches, was
       there  zero effort involved on our part in integrating the
       patches or figuring out what  was  wrong?   Probably  not.
       Bug  reports and patches can be extremely valuable, and we
       can't say that in no event do they qualify you to get  out
       of contributing - after all, we're leaving that up to your
       judgement anyway, aren't we?  But unless your contribution
       was  pretty massive, and is actually in this distribution,



                                                                2

       we aren't likely to agree with you about this.

       Q: Software should be free.   You have no right to ask for
       money to support this effort.

       A:  You  are  entitled  to  that opinion, but please don't
       raise it on the mailing list, as it will tend to get  peo­
       ple  excited.  Please remember that while copying software
       is generally a very cheap process,  creating  it  is  not.
       The  amount of work that's gone into this software package
       is quite significant, and there's plenty more work to  do.
       If  you  happen  to  be  in  college,  working toward your
       degree, and have no social life (and yes, I've been  there
       and done that) then it can seem like there's no additional
       cost to hacking on software - after all, it's  fun,  isn't
       it?  While this is true, it is also true that you're a lot
       better off with this software than  you  would  have  been
       with the software I wrote in college.  Enough said?

       Q: Can't I contribute work instead of software?

       A:  We'd  like  to  encourage that to some extent, and are
       indeed trying to bring some developers into the fold,  but
       you  shouldn't  expect  that  your  willingness to do this
       translates directly into an opportunity.  For example, you
       may  want  very  much to work for [insert the name of your
       favorite commercial Linux vendor  here],  but  unless  you
       have  the appropriate skills, they like you, they're will­
       ing to pay what you need, and they have work that's appro­
       priate  to  your  skills,  you're  not  going to get hired
       there.

       Q: I don't contribute to the Free  Software  Foundation  -
       why do you rate?

       A:  You  should contribute to the Free Software Foundation
       too!

       Q: I don't contribute to [insert name of your  local  food
       bank here].  Why do you rate?

       A:  If  you  feel  bad about not contributing to the local
       food bank, this is a very easy problem to  solve,  and  we
       encourage you to do so.

       Q: Once I've contributed once, am I done?

       A:  We'd  like to encourage you to contribute once a year.
       If you want, we can send you a reminder notice on the year
       anniversary  of  your original contribution.  If you don't
       specifically ask for this, we won't force it on  you.   No
       salesperson  will  call.   No spam will be sent.  We defi­
       nitely won't try to convince you that  it's  been  a  year
       since you last contributed when it hasn't been a year yet.

       Q: I don't have you in my budget this year.

       A: Fine, put us in your budget for next year!

       Q: It's really hard to do charitable contributions  at  my
       organization.

       A:  We'd  be  happy to sell you a product instead.  If you
       choose to go down this route, what  we'l  sell  you  is  a
       license  for some number of clients and a CD.  Just let us
       know how many DHCP clients you have,  and  we'll  use  the
       following  schedule  to figure out how much to invoice you
       (shipping is included on orders of $100 or more).  Even if
       you can do charitable contributions, you might want to use
       this schedule as a guideline for figuring out how much  to
       donate.   It  is  only  a  guideline,  of  course - if the
       amounts listed feel like too much or too little to you, do
       what seems appropriate.

               $5k for charities supporting >10k nodes
               $2.5k for businesses supporting >1k nodes
               $1k for charities supporting >1k nodes
               $500 for businesses with >500 nodes
               $250 for charities with >500 nodes
               $200 for businesses with >150 nodes
               $100 for charities with >150 nodes
               $100 for businesses with <150 nodes
               $50 for charities with <150 nodes
               $25 for home use, client or server
               $0.10 to $1 per client for businesses that are reselling the
                       client, depending on volume.

       Q:  Are  you  nuts?    I live in [insert your country name
       here] and the typical annual salary for  a  programmer  is
       less than what you're asking me to contribute!

       A:  We  leave  the  choice of how much to contribute up to
       you.   Really.  We aren't kidding.

       Q: Can I contribute with my credit card?

       A: Yes.   The details haven't  been  ironed  out  at  this
       writing,   but   if   you   send  mail  to  dhcp-contribu­
       tions@isc.org, we'll work it out.   By the time  you  read
       this,  we may have a web interface set up - if so, it will
       be linked in at http://www.isc.org/dhcp-contrib.html.
