       The  Internet  Software  Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient,
       provides a means  for  configuring  one  or  more  network
       interfaces  using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,
       BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by  statically
       assigning an address.

OOPPEERRAATTIIOONN
       The  DHCP  protocol  allows  a  host  to contact a central
       server which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be
       assigned  on  one  or  more  subnets.    A DHCP client may
       request an address from this pool, and then use  it  on  a
       temporary  basis  for communication on network.   The DHCP
       protocol also provides a mechanism whereby  a  client  can
       learn  important  details about the network to which it is
       attached, such as the location of a  default  router,  the
       location of a name server, and so on.

       On  startup, dhclient reads the _d_h_c_l_i_e_n_t_._c_o_n_f for configu­
       ration instructions.   It then gets a list of all the net­
       work interfaces that are configured in the current system.
       For each interface, it attempts to configure the interface
       using the DHCP protocol.

       In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and
       server restarts, dhclient keeps a list of  leases  it  has
       been   assigned   in  the  dhclient.leases(5)  file.    On
       startup, after reading the  dhclient.conf  file,  dhclient
       reads the dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about
       what leases it has been assigned.

       When a new lease is acquired, it is appended to the end of
       the  dhclient.leases  file.   In order to prevent the file
       from  becoming  arbitrarily  large,  from  time  to   time
       dhclient  creates  a new dhclient.leases file from its in-
       core   lease   database.    The   old   version   of   the
       dhclient.leases   file   is   retained   under   the  name
       _d_h_c_l_i_e_n_t_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~ until the next time dhclient rewrites the
       database.

       Old  leases  are  kept  around  in case the DHCP server is
       unavailable when dhclient is first invoked (generally dur­
       ing the initial system boot process).   In that event, old
       leases from the dhclient.leases file which  have  not  yet
       expired  are  tested,  and  if  they  are determined to be
       valid, they are used until either they expire or the  DHCP



                                                                1

       server becomes available.

       A mobile host which may sometimes need to access a network
       on which no DHCP server exists may  be  preloaded  with  a
       lease  for  a  fixed  address  on that network.   When all
       attempts to contact a DHCP server  have  failed,  dhclient
       will try to validate the static lease, and if it succeeds,
       will use that lease until it is restarted.

       A mobile host may also travel to some  networks  on  which
       DHCP is not available but BOOTP is.   In that case, it may
       be advantageous to arrange with the network  administrator
       for  an  entry on the BOOTP database, so that the host can
       boot quickly on that network rather than  cycling  through
       the list of old leases.

       The  names  of the network interfaces that dhclient should
       attempt to configure may be specified on the command line.
       If  no  interface  names are specified on the command line
       dhclient will normally identify  all  network  interfaces,
       elimininating  non-broadcast  interfaces  if possible, and
       attempt to configure each interface.

       It is also possible to specify interfaces by name  in  the
       ddhhcclliieenntt..ccoonnff((55))  file.    If  interfaces are specified in
       this way, then the client will only  configure  interfaces
       that  are either specified in the configuration file or on
       the command line, and will ignore all other interfaces.

       If the DHCP client should listen and transmit  on  a  port
       other  than  the standard (port 68), the --pp flag may used.
       It should be followed by the udp port number that dhclient
       should use.  This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.
       If a different port is specified for the client to  listen
       on  and  transmit on, the client will also use a different
       destination port - one greater than the specified destina­
       tion port.

       The  DHCP  client normally transmits any protocol messages
       it   sends   before   acquiring   an   IP   address    to,
       255.255.255.255,  the  IP limited broadcast address.   For
       debugging purposes, it may be useful to  have  the  server
       transmit  these messages to some other address.   This can
       be specified with the --ss flag, followed by the IP  address
       or domain name of the destination.

       The  DHCP client will normally run in the foreground until
       it has configured an interface, and then  will  revert  to
       running  in  the  background.    To  run force dhclient to
       always run as a foreground process, the --dd flag should  be
       specified.  This is useful when running the client under a
       debugger, or when running it out of inittab  on  System  V
       systems.



                                                                2

       The  client  writes  a  temporary shell script whenever it
       invokes dhclient-script.   This script is normally deleted
       after  the  client runs, but it can be helpful when debug­
       ging the client script to see what the client wrote.   The
       client  can  be  configured not to delete these scripts by
       specifying the --DD flag.

       The client normally prints a startup message and  displays
       the  protocol  sequence  to  the standard error descriptor
       until it has acquired an address, and then only logs  mes­
       sages  using  the  ssyysslloogg ((33)) facility.   The --qq flag pre­
       vents any messages other than errors from being printed to
       the standard error descriptor.

       The  DHCP  client normally gets its configuration informa­
       tion from  //eettcc//ddhhcclliieenntt..ccoonnff,,  its  lease  database  from
       //vvaarr//ddbb//ddhhcclliieenntt..lleeaasseess  and  stores  its  process ID in a
       file called //vvaarr//rruunn//ddhhcclliieenntt..ppiidd..  To  specify  different
       names  and/or  locations for these files, use the --ccff,, --llff
       and --ppff flags, respectively, followed by the name  of  the
       file.    This  can be particularly useful if, for example,
       //vvaarr//ddbb or //vvaarr//rruunn has not yet been mounted when the DHCP
       client is started.

       The  DHCP  client normally exits if it isn't able to iden­
       tify any network interfaces to configure.   On laptop com­
       puters  and  other computers with hot-swappable I/O buses,
       it is possible that a broadcast  interface  may  be  added
       after  system  startup.   The --ww flag can be used to cause
       the client not to exit  when  it  doesn't  find  any  such
       interfaces.    The ddhhccppccccpp ((88)) program can then be used to
       notify the client when a network interface has been  added
       or removed, so that the client can configure an IP address
       on that interface.

       This  client  was  substantially  modified and enhanced by
       Elliot Poger for use on Linux while he was working on  the
       MosquitoNet project at Stanford.

       The  current  version owes much to Elliot's Linux enhance­
       ments, but was  substantially  reorganized  and  partially
       rewritten  by  Ted  Lemon so as to use the same networking
       framework  that  the  Internet  Software  Consortium  DHCP
       server uses.   Much system-specific configuration code was
       moved into a shell script so  that  as  support  for  more
       operating  systems  is  added, it will not be necessary to
       port and maintain system-specific  configuration  code  to
       these  operating  systems  - instead, the shell script can
       invoke the native tools to accomplish the same purpose.
