       dhclient.leases - DHCP client lease database

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a per­
       sistent database of leases that it has acquired  that  are
       still valid.   The database is a free-form ASCII file con­
       taining one valid declaration per lease.    If  more  than
       one declaration appears for a given lease, the last one in
       the file is used.   The file is written as a log, so  this
       is not an unusual occurrance.

       The  format  of  the  lease  declarations  is described in
       ddhhcclliieenntt..ccoonnff((55))..
