      The "Artistic License"

      Preamble

      The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
      Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
      semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
      while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
      the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
      reasonable modifications.

      Definitions:

      "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
      Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
      created through textual modification.

      "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
      modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
      of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

      "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
      copyrights for the package.

      "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
      this Package.

      "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
      basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
      and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
      Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
      as a market that must bear the fee.)

      "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
      itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
      It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
      under the same conditions they received it.

      1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
      Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
      duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

      2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
      derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
      modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

      3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
      that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
      when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
      following:

          a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
          Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
          an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
          site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
          your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

          b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

          c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
          with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
          a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
          documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

          d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
      executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

          a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
          together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
          to get the Standard Version.

          b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
          the Package with your modifications.

          c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
          document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
          with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

          d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
      Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
      Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
      you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
      commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
      distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
      product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
      an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
      form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
      interpreter is so embedded.

      6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
      output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
      under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
      them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
      Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
      Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
      binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
      neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
      fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
      not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
      Package.

      7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
      languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
      emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
      Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
      equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
      not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
      regression tests for the language.

      8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
      permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
      when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
      to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
      construed as a distribution of this Package.

      9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
      products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

      10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      GPLv2 Disclaimer:
      For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice
      other than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead,
      Oracle elects to use only the General Public License version 2
      (GPLv2) at this time for any software where a choice of GPL
      license versions is made available with the language indicating
      that GPLv2 or any later version may be used, or where a choice
      of which version of the GPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.
