Comment:
 File lacks copyright and licensing, but contains the comment
 "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it" which
 might be interpreted as a copyright holder not granting a license.
 More likely, however, the header file is considered non-copyrightable
 header with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:
 .
  * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1 (according to git sources),
    together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment but
    also explicit copyright and licensing:
    <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.
 .
  * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999 (according to git sources),
    at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it> released
    audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
    <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/authors/a0002451.htm>

 like a copyright holder not granting a license. We instead assume that

Comment:
 Version of license not mentioned.  Assumed to be version 2.

License: GPL-2-Asterisk
 Asterisk is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
 and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
 with Digium, Inc. If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL
 applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,
 except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
 source tree in the file COPYING.
 .
 This package also includes various components that are not part of
 Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
 and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
 GPL version 2 as well.
 .
 Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright
 and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk
 package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
 for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or
 Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at
 runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our
 copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible
 licenses than GPL.
 .
 If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
 there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
 GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we
 would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).
 .
 Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
 and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.
 .
 In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the
 Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface
 (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to
 manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed
 under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols
 do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,
 should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do
 fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to
 use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external
 applications licensed under any license you wish.
 .
 The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,
 and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
 wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
 redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you
 should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
 steps you must take. For more information on this policy, please read:
