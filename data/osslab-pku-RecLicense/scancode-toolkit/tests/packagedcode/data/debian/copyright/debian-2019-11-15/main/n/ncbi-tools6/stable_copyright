Comment:
 nc0225.aso.gz and dsRNA_viruses.* can be dowloaded by running:
    wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1/daily-nc/nc0225.aso.gz
    wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/ASN_BINARY/Viruses/dsRNA_viruses.ags.gz
    wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Viruses/dsRNA_viruses.gene_info.gz
 .
 spidey_* can be downloaded using their accession numbers with help of idfetch, e.g.:
    idfetch -dn -t 5 -c 1 -g 1327850419 -o spidey_mRNA.fasta
    idfetch -dn -t 5 -c 1 -g 568802167 -o spidey_genome.fasta
 .
 Based on the example provided in /usr/share/doc/ncbi-tools-bin/tbl2asn.txt.gz,
 Sc_16.sbt was generated using NCBI Submission Portal:
    https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/template/submission/
 .
 The examples for Sc_16.fsa and Sc_16.tbl were taken from here:
