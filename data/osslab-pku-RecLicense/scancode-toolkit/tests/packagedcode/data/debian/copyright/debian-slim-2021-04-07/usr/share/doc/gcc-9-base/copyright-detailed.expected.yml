      GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

      Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

      Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
      license document, but changing it is not allowed.

      This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
      permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
      3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
      bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
      the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

      When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
      certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
      program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
      non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
      header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

      0. Definitions.

      A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
      Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
      interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
      on the Runtime Library.

      "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
      modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
      the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
      subsequent versions published by the FSF.

      "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
      modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
      the license of GCC.

      "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
      target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
      input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
      phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
      format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
      for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

      The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
      non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
      Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
      use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
      part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
      understood as starting with the output of the generators or
      preprocessors.

      A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
      with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
      work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
      optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
      Eligible Compilation Process.

      1. Grant of Additional Permission.

      You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
      combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
      propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
      all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
      may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
      consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
