      \ with capabilities\n     similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of\n\
      \     cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more\n     sense because\
      \ it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities\n     between some Free Software\
      \ licenses and the GPL.\n \n     Please note that in many cases it is better for a library\
      \ to be\n     licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free\n    \
      \ software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does\n     less to protect\
      \ the freedom of the users of the code that it\n     covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html\
      \ for\n     more explanation."
