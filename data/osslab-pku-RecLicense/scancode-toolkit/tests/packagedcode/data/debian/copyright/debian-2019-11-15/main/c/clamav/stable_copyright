Comment:
 Due to license incompatibilities the libclamunrar code is split from the
 upstream tarball into a libclamunrar tarball.
 .
 The excluded files below just make the tarball unnecessarily large, or
 interfere with the version management.  For llvm, we use the system version.
Files-Excluded:
 win32/*
 libclamav/c++/llvm/*
 libclammspack/*

Comment:
 See COPYING.YARA. The GPL exception has been granted by upstream in
 https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11336:
  Steven Morgan 2015-07-21 23:02:01 CEST
  The Apache 2 license notification for YARA is in the file COPYING.YARA,
  similar to what we do for bzip2 and at least 9 other third party components
  included in ClamAV. We also maintain the Apache v2 license header within the
  YARA source code files as well as noting that the file is modified. We also
  intend to write a GPL exclusion, as is done for OpenSSL. We believe these to
  be sufficient indicators of which licenses apply to which source files.
