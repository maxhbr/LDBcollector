License: License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software
 IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
 NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
 the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
 downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
 printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
 or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
 of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,

 .
 RECITALS
 .
 Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
 hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
 laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
 property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
 patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
 in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
 patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
 it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
 agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
 .
 1.  DEFINITIONS
 .
 1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
 downloads or otherwise obtains the SOFTWARE.

 2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
 the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
 SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:
 .
 2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
 SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
 and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
 use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
 by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
 and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).
 .
 2.1.2  Open Source Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms
 of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE may be copied and redistributed solely for
 use on operating systems distributed under the terms of an OSI-approved
 open source license as listed by the Open Source Initiative at
 http://opensource.org, provided that the binary files thereof are not
 modified, and Customer provides a copy of this license with the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.1.3  Limitations.
 .
 No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
 decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
 manner to obtain the source code.
 .
 Usage. SOFTWARE is licensed only for use with microprocessor(s) which have
 been (i) designed by NVIDIA and (ii) either (a) sold by or (b) licensed by
 NVIDIA. Customer shall not use SOFTWARE in conjunction with, nor cause
 SOFTWARE to be executed by, any other microprocessor.
 .
 No Translation. Customer shall not translate SOFTWARE, nor cause or permit
 SOFTWARE to be translated, from the architecture or language in which it is
 originally provided by NVIDIA, into any other architecture or language.
 .
 No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
 else.
