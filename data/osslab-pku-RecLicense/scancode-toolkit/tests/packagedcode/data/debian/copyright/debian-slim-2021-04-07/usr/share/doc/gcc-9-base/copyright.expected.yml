      \ (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n \n Everyone is permitted\
      \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\n license document, but changing it is\
      \ not allowed.\n \n This GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional\n\
      \ permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\n 3 (\"GPLv3\"\
      ). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\n bears a notice placed by\
      \ the copyright holder of the file stating that\n the file is governed by GPLv3 along\
      \ with this Exception.\n \n When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions\
      \ of\n certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\n program. The\
      \ purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\n non-GPL (including proprietary)\
      \ programs to use, in this way, the\n header files and runtime libraries covered by this\
      \ Exception.\n \n 0. Definitions.\n \n A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either\
      \ requires the Runtime\n Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use\
      \ of an\n interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\n on the\
      \ Runtime Library.\n \n \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or\
      \ without\n modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\n the\
      \ GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\n subsequent versions\
      \ published by the FSF.\n \n \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions\
      \ of propagation,\n modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\n\
      \ the license of GCC.\n \n \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real\
      \ or virtual\n target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\n input\
      \ to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\n phase. Notwithstanding that, Target\
      \ Code does not include data in any\n format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation,\
      \ or used\n for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n \n The \"Compilation\
      \ Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\n non-intermediate languages designed\
      \ for human-written code, and/or in\n Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code.\
      \ Thus, for example,\n use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\n\
      \ part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\n understood as\
      \ starting with the output of the generators or\n preprocessors.\n \n A Compilation Process\
      \ is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\n with other GPL-compatible software,\
      \ or if it is done without using any\n work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible\
      \ Software to\n optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\n\
      \ Eligible Compilation Process.\n \n 1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n \n You have\
      \ permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\n combining the Runtime Library\
      \ with Independent Modules, even if such\n propagation would otherwise violate the terms\
      \ of GPLv3, provided that\n all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes.\
      \ You\n may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\n consistent with\
      \ the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n \n 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n \n\
      \ The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\n presumption that third-party\
      \ software is unaffected by the copyleft\n requirements of the license of GCC."
