Comment:
 Due to license incompatibilities the libclamunrar code is split from the
 upstream tarball into a libclamunrar tarball.
 .
 The excluded files below just make the tarball unnecessarily large, or
 interfere with the version management.  For llvm, we use the system version.
Files-Excluded:
 win32/*
 libclamav/c++/llvm/*
 libclammspack/*
