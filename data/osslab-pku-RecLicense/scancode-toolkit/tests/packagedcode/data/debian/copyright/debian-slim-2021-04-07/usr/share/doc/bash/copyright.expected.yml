      The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
       Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
       no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
       interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
       and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
       exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
       based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.
