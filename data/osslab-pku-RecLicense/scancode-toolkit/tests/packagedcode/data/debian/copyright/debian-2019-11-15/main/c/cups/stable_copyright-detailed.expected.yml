      In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
      the following special exception:

           1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

      a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
      for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
      Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
      third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
      for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
      CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
      or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
      considered to be a derivative work or collective work
      based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
      mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
      You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
      the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
      Software without releasing the source code of the
      Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
      filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
      Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
      source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

      b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
      software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,
      Inc., including but not limited to all existing
      releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,
      and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on
      releases and future versions thereof.

      c. This exception is only available for Apple
      OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
      that is distributed for use on other operating
      systems.

      d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
      exception have the following text at the top of each
      source file:

      This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
      Software exception.

           2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

      a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and
      distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL
      Toolkit.

      No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
      derived work.
