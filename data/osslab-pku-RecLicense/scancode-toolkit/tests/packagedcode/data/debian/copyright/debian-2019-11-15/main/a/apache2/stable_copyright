 For compliance with Mr Darwin's terms: this has been very significantly
 modified from the free "file" command.
 - all-in-one file for compilation convenience when moving from one
   version of Apache to the next.
 - Memory allocation is done through the Apache API's apr_pool_t structure.
 - All functions have had necessary Apache API request or server
   structures passed to them where necessary to call other Apache API
   routines.  (i.e. usually for logging, files, or memory allocation in
   itself or a called function.)
 - struct magic has been converted from an array to a single-ended linked
   list because it only grows one record at a time, it's only accessed
   sequentially, and the Apache API has no equivalent of realloc().
 - Functions have been changed to get their parameters from the server
   configuration instead of globals.  (It should be reentrant now but has
   not been tested in a threaded environment.)
 - Places where it used to print results to stdout now saves them in a
   list where they're used to set the MIME type in the Apache request
   record.
 - Command-line flags have been removed since they will never be used here.

   As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
   part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
   parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
   as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
   the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
   special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
   Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
   License without this special exception.

   This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
