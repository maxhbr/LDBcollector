  "long_description": "\nSome helper functions for parsing URLs, sanitizing them, normalizing them in pure python.\n\nThis includes support for escaping, unescaping, punycoding, unpunycoding,\ncleaning parameter and query strings, and a little more sanitization.\n\nThis version is a friendly fork of the upstream from Moz to keep a pure Python\nversion around to run on Python 2.7 and all OSes.\nIt also uses an alternate publicsuffix list provider package.\n\n",
