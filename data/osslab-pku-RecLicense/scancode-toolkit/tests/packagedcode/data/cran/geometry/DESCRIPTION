Description: Makes the 'Qhull' library <http://www.qhull.org>
    available in R, in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull
    computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
    intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
    Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
    runs in 2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions. It implements the
    Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does not
    support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of
    non-convex objects, but the package does include some R functions
    that allow for this.
