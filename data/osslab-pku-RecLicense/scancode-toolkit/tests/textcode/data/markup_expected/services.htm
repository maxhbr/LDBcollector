			* Encode/decode Internationalized Domain Names.
			* 
			* The class allows to convert internationalized domain names
			* (see RFC 3490 for details) as they can be used with various registries worldwide
			* to be translated between their original (localized) form and their encoded form
			* as it will be used in the DNS (Domain Name System).
			*
			* The class provides two public methods, encode() and decode(), which do exactly
			* what you would expect them to do. You are allowed to use complete domain names,
			* simple strings and complete email addresses as well. That means, that you might
			* use any of the following notations:
			* 
			* - www.nörgler.com
			* - xn--nrgler-wxa
			* - xn--brse-5qa.xn--knrz-1ra.info
			*
			* Unicode input might be given as either UTF-8 string, UCS-4 string or UCS-4 array.
			* Unicode output is available in the same formats.
			* You can select your preferred format via {@link set_paramter()}.
			*
			* ACE input and output is always expected to be ASCII.
