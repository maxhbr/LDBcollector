PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
Version 1.0 

1.0 DEFINITIONS.

1.1. "Commercial Use" means distribution or otherwise 
  making the Documentation available to a third party. 

1.2. "Contributor" means a person or entity who 
  creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications. 

1.3. "Documentation" means the Original Documentation 
  or Modifications or the combination of the Original Documentation and Modifications, 
  in each case including portions thereof.

1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a 
  mechanism generally accepted for the electronic transfer of data. 

1.5. "Initial Writer" means the individual or entity 
  identified as the Initial Writer in the notice required by the Appendix. 


1.6. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Documentation 
  or portions thereof with documentation or other writings not governed by the 
  terms of this License. 

1.7. "License" means this document. 

1.8. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion 
  from the substance or structure of either the Original Documentation or any 
  previous Modifications, such as a translation, abridgment, condensation, or 
  any other form in which the Original Documentation or previous Modifications 
  may be recast, transformed or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, 
  annotations, elaborations, and other modifications which, as a whole represent 
  an original work of authorship, is a Modification. For example, when Documentation 
  is released as a series of documents, a Modification is: 

A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents 
  of the Original Documentation or previous Modifications. 

B. Any new documentation that contains any part 
  of the Original Documentation or previous Modifications. 

1.9. "Original Documentation" means documentation 
  described as Original Documentation in the notice required by the Appendix, 
  and which, at the time of its release under this License is not already Documentation 
  governed by this License. 

1.10. "Editable Form" means the preferred form of 
  the Documentation for making Modifications to it. The Documentation can be in 
  an electronic, compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression 
  or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge. 

1.11. "You" (or "Your") means an individual 
  or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms 
  of this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 5.0 
  ("Versions of the License"). For legal entities, "You" includes 
  any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 
  You. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, 
  direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether 
  by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) 
  of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2.0 LICENSE GRANTS.

2.1 Initial Writer Grant.

 The Initial Writer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
  license to use, reproduce, prepare Modifications of, compile, publicly perform, 
  publicly display, demonstrate, market, disclose and distribute the Documentation 
  in any form, on any media or via any Electronic Distribution Mechanism or other 
  method now known or later discovered, and to sublicense the foregoing rights 
  to third parties through multiple tiers of sublicensees in accordance with the 
  terms of this License. 
 The license rights granted in this Section 2.1 ("Initial Writer Grant") 
  are effective on the date Initial Writer first distributes Original Documentation 
  under the terms of this License. 
 
2.2. Contributor Grant.

 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
  license to use, reproduce, prepare Modifications of, compile, publicly perform, 
  publicly display, demonstrate, market, disclose and distribute the Documentation 
  in any form, on any media or via any Electronic Distribution Mechanism or other 
  method now known or later discovered, and to sublicense the foregoing rights 
  to third parties through multiple tiers of sublicensees in accordance with the 
  terms of this License. 
 The license rights granted in this Section 2.2 ("Contributor Grant") 
  are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Documentation. 


3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

 3.1. Application of License

 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed 
  by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2 ("Contributor 
  Grant"). The Documentation may be distributed only under the terms of this 
  License or a future version of this License released in accordance with Section 
  5.0 ("Versions of the License"), and You must include a copy of this 
  License with every copy of the Documentation You distribute. You may not offer 
  or impose any terms that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License 
  or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional 
  document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5 ("Required 
  Notices"). 

3.2. Availability of Documentation.

 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
  available publicly in Editable Form under the terms of this License via a fixed 
  medium or an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism. 

3.3. Description of Modifications.

 All Documentation to which You contribute must identify the changes You made 
  to create that Documentation and the date of any change. You must include a 
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, 
  from Original Documentation provided by the Initial Writer and include the name 
  of the Initial Writer in the Documentation or via an electronic link that describes 
  the origin or ownership of the Documentation. The foregoing change documentation 
  may be created by using an electronic program that automatically tracks changes 
  to the Documentation, and such changes must be available publicly for at least 
  five years following release of the changed Documentation. 

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

 Contributor represents that Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications 
  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights 
  to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

 3.5. Required Notices.

 You must duplicate the notice in the Appendix in each file 
  of the Documentation. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular 
  Documentation file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in 
  a location (such as a relevant directory) where a reader would be likely to 
  look for such a notice, for example, via a hyperlink in each file of the Documentation 
  that takes the reader to a page that describes the origin and ownership of the 
  Documentation. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name 
  as a Contributor to the notice described in the  Appendix. 

 You must also duplicate this License in any Documentation file (or with a 
  hyperlink in each file of the Documentation) where You describe recipients' 
  rights or ownership rights. 
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity 
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Documentation. However, 
  You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Writer 
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, 
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Writer and every Contributor for any liability 
  incurred by the Initial Writer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, 
  support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

 3.6. Larger Works.

 You may create a Larger Work by combining Documentation with other documents 
  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as 
  a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
  License are fulfilled for the Documentation.

4.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. 

 This License applies to Documentation to which the Initial Writer has attached 
  this License and the notice in the Appendix.

5.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. 

 5.1. New Versions.

 Initial Writer may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from 
  time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 

 5.2. Effect of New Versions.

 Once Documentation has been published under a particular version of the License, 
  You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 
  choose to use such Documentation under the terms of any subsequent version of 
  the License published by __________________[Insert name of the foundation, 
  company, Initial Writer, or whoever may modify this License]. No one other 
  than _________________ [Insert name of the foundation, company, Initial Writer, 
  or whoever may modify this License] has the right to modify the terms of 
  this License. Filling in the name of the Initial Writer, Original Documentation 
  or Contributor in the notice described in the 
  Appendix shall not be deemed to be Modifications of this License.

 6.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 

 DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT 
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
  WARRANTIES THAT THE DOCUMENTATION IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR 
  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, 
  AND PERFORMANCE OF THE DOCUMENTATION IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY DOCUMENTATION PROVE 
  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL WRITER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) 
  ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
  OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY DOCUMENTATION 
  IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

 7.0 TERMINATION. 

 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
  if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 
  30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Documentation 
  which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions 
  which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this 
  License shall survive. 
 

 8.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING 
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL WRITER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, 
  OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, 
  BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
  DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
  GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
  DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF THE DOCUMENTATION, 
  EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 


 9.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

 If Documentation is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government 
  or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then 
  the Government's rights in Documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; 
  this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department 
  of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD 
  acquisitions).
 
10.0 MISCELLANEOUS. 

 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter 
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
  shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This 
  License shall be governed by California law, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. 
  With respect to disputes or any litigation relating to this License, the losing 
  party is responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and 
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations 
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
