# This file is for collecting the actual text found in Fedora
# packages that have used the Callaway short name, "Freely redistributable without restriction" 
# or other texts that are comprised of ultra-permissive licenses that contain 
# no conditions upon the license grant, regardless of what Callaway 
# short name may have been used. The License: field for packages that have text listed here can use 
# the SPDX-conformant identifier, "LicenseRef-Fedora-UltraPermissive" going forward.
# For more information, see the instructions at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/update-existing-packages/#_callaway_short_name_categories
#
# Include the following information:
# 
# Fedora package name
#
# Location of where you found the license notice text.
# Preferably this would be a direct link to a file. If that is not possible,
# provide enough information such that someone else can find the text in the wild
# where you found it.
#
# The actual text found that corresponds to the use of 
# the "Freely redistributable without restrictions" (previously) or (proposed use of) "LicenseRef-Fedora-MaxPermissive" identifiers.
#
# Copy template below and add yours to top of list, adding a space between entries.
