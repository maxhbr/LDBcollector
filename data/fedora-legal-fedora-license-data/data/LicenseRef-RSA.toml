This is a Free permissive license, likely derived from the MIT license (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT?rd=Licensing/MIT#Old_Style_.28no_advertising_without_permission.29). It is sometimes misdetected by the licensecheck as "NTP", but that is a different MIT variant license.

It is not clear if this license is GPL-compatible or not, due to the second section of the license.

A copy of this license was taken from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/file/cf09f0b56efd/src/jdk.crypto.cryptoki/share/native/libj2pkcs11/pkcs11.h on 2018-06-28.
