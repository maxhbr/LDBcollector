Various portions of source code from Tony Robinson's "shorten-2.0"
package are used here by permission of Tony Robinson and SoftSound,
Inc. <http://www.softsound.com> -- these portions are found in the file
"shorten_x.c"; please note the copyright information in that file.  By
agreement with Tony Robinson and SoftSound, Inc, the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC) grants permission to copy and use this software for the
purpose of reading "shorten"-compressed speech data provided in NIST
SPHERE file format by the LDC or others.  SoftSound provides useful
tools for audio compression and other signal processing tasks.

Other portions of source code (in particular the "writeRIFFHeader" and
"writeAIFFHeader" functions in "file_headers.c", and the "alaw2pcm"
conversion function) were adapted from the "SoX" package, a valuable
open-source tool maintained primarily by Chris Bagwell, with assistance
from many others (http://sox.sourceforge.net/).  We gratefully
acknowledge the value provided by all contributors to SoX; sph2pipe
would have been much harder to write without this resource.  We
recommend that you use SoX if you need to do sample-rate conversion on
audio data.
