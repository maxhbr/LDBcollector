\section{Excursion: The problem of license compatibility [tbd]}
\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
Here we discuss the often neglected or only superficially treated problem of combining
differently licensed software. We will hint to the Exclusion-List of the Free
software foundation; we will hint to the Eclipse / GPL-plugin problem; we will
mention the recent discussion whether the kernel requires to license the
complete Android as GPL; and finally we will discuss the just now published, short
analysis of Jaeger and Metzger presenting a combining matrix which seems to fall
into their lap. % RPD FIXME What is this supposed to mean?
We will argue that the question can simply be answered:
Only if you embed two libraries which both are licensed under an
on-top-development protecting license and if both these licenses require the
licensing of the derivated work by different licenses then you have a problem.
In all other cases which we will describe, there is no problem.
