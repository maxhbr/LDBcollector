The LGPL-v2.1 contains one sentence which literally refers to the issues of
\emph{reverse engineering}:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] you may [\ldots] combine or link a
\enquote{work that uses the Library} with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and \emph{reverse engineering} for debugging such
modifications.}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp., ยง6. ]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.
The first ellipse in this citation -- notated by the string '[\ldots]' -- refers
to the phrase \enquote{As an exception to the Sections above,}, the second to
the phrase \enquote{also}. These words together want to indicate, that the LGPL
offers its ยง6-way-of-distribution as an exception to the intended default way of
distributing such a Library. So, the nature of the extraordinary way itself is
not affected by this hint. Thus, we feel free to erase this contextual
link.}}\end{quote}

Hereinafter, we will sometimes denote these lines by
the term \emph{LGPL2-RefEng-Sentence}.
