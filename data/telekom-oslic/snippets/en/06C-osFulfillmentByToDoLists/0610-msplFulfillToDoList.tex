\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}
\label{MSPLDiscussion}

The MS-PL is also a very permissive and short license. It requires to do:
(a) You must preserve existing licensing elements. (b) You must distribute
the source code as whole or \enquote{portions} of the source code under the
MS-PL. (c) You must add a copy of the license if you distribute (parts of) the
source code. (d) If you distribute a binary package, you must distribute (the
parts of) the work under a license \enquote{that complies with this (MS-PL)
license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{MsplOsiLicense2013a}.

The most confusing clause is probably the condition, to \enquote{[\ldots]
distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form [\ldots]
only [\ldots] under a license that complies with this license}. But a closer
examination is lighting the situation: The only other conditions of the license
which refer to the context of distributing binaries are the requirements a) not
to abuse trademarks, b) not to bring a patent claim against any contributor, and
c) not to expect any warranties or guarantees with respect to the distributed
portion\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3A, §3B, §3E]{MsplOsiLicense2013a}.

Based on these readings we decided \ldots

\label{MsplSourceBinHint} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ldots to let you incorporate a copy of the license into your
  distribution even if it only contains the binaries of the unmodified version:
  if you have not modified it, you do not lose any advantage if you add the
  license, too. So, this is the best method to fulfill the \emph{MSL-PL binary
  condition}.
  \item \ldots to erase all mandatory conditions in case of the binary
  distributions: the patent restriction of the MS-PL itself is already covered
  by the MS-PL patent section of the \oslic\footnote{$\rightarrow$ \oslic, p.\
  \patentpageref{MSPL}} and the no warranty clause of the MS-PL by
  the \oslic{} section concerning the power of the MS-PL\footnote{$\rightarrow$
  \oslic, p.\ \protectionpageref{MSPL}} while the trademark
  restrictions are explicitly added into the prohibition section.
  \item \ldots to erase the hints to a voluntarily updated copyright dialog in
  case of distributing a snimoli independently because the copyright dialog
  normally is designed by the overarching work which uses the library, not by
  the library itself.
\end{itemize}
