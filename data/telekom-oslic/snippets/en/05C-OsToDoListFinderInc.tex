As discussed earlier, there are of course some invalid or irrelevant
combinations.\footnote{type::proapse excludes state::embedded;
recipient::4yourself excludes the combination with state::independent and
type::snimoli; any value of class 'mode' implies state::embedded; form is only
relevant if recipient::2others; ioAccess is only relevant if
recipient::4yourself[for details see page
\pageref{InvalidFinderTokenCombinations}]. If you have encountered one of these
invalid combinations, please check the corresponding explanations.} Here are
some extra explanations concerning the classes resp. the focuses:

\begin{description}
\item[Type:] A piece of (open source) software is a program, an application, or
a server, only if you can start its binary form with your normal program
launcher, or (in case of a text file which still must be interpreted by an
interpreter like php, perl, bash etc.) if you can start an interpreter which
takes the file as one of its arguments and executes the commands.
\item[State:] You are modifying a piece of (open source) software if you expand,
reduce or modify at least one of the received software files, and---in case of
dealing with binary object code---if you (re)compile and (re)link the modified
software to a new binary file. But if you only modify some of the configuration
files, you are not modifying the open source software itself.
\item[Context:] You are using a piece of open source software as an embedded
component of a larger unit \ldots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  if one of your files of the larger unit contains a verbatim or a
  modified copy (i.e.\ a snippet) of the received open source software, or
  \item if your larger unit contains an include statement referring to a
  functionally defining file of the received open source software, or
  \item if your larger unit calls a function defined in the received open source
  software, or
  \item if your development environment contains a compiler or linker directive
  referring to the received open source software (binaries) and if your larger
  unit can't be executed without resolving this linker directive.
  \end{itemize}
\item[Recipient:] You are using the received open source software only for
yourself, if you as a person do not pass it to other entities like persons,
organizations, companies etc., or if you---as a member of a specific
development group---pass it only to the other members of your development
group. But if you store open source software on any device such as a mobile
phone, an USB stick, etc.\ or if you attach it to any transport medium like
email etc.\ and if you then sell, give away, or simply send this device or
transport medium to anyone (other than a direct member of your development
group) then you indeed hand the open source software over to third
parties.\footnote{Please remember that---at least in Germany---there are
opinions that even handing over software to another legal entity or department
of the same company is also a kind of distribution. It is always safest to take
the broadest possible meaning.}
\item[Form:] Open source software knows two ways to distribute the software: in
the form of binaries and in the form of sources. Mostly it is up to you to
decide whether you want to distribute only the binaries or whether you are
intentionally going to distribute the sources (too). At a first glance, the
concepts 'sources' and 'binaries' seems to be clearly distinguished.
On the one hand, compiled sources should be taken as binaries. On the other
hand, editable pieces of software are denoted by the concept 'sources'. But
sometimes the difference is not as clear as wished: For example, you can modify
even already compiled object files by using an hex-editor. Or it is very
difficult to modify the minimized versions of javascript files even if they are
indeed text files. Therefore, the OSLiC 'reuses' a famous \textbf{rule of
thumb}: \enquote{The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it}.\citeGPLtwo{ยง3} All other forms are denoted by
the concept of 'binaries'. Based on this specification, you can respect some
special conditions if you want to distribute the sources and/or the binaries.
\item[ioAccess:] If you execute an open source program or an own program using
an open source library, then (normally) you do not distribute that software.
Under these circumstances, the most open source licenses do not require anything
for executing the program compliantly - even if it is the base of a globally
used internet service. For closing this 'gap', the AGPL has been invented: Like
the GPL, the AGPL let the obligation to fulfill the well known set of GPL tasks
be triggered by distributing the software. But, it let these tasks also be
triggered by an established remote network interaction: whoever interacts with
the locally executed program remotely through a computer network gets all the
rights which normally the receiver of a distribution gets. Nevertheless, the
AGPL does not wish to cause an overhead of tasks: Only \emph{locally excuted
open source programs which have been modfied} or \emph{locally executed own
programs using an AGPL licensed library} shall indeed trigger the fulfillment of
the requirements. Thus, we introduced the features \emph{ioAccess:onlyLocally}
and \emph{ioAccess:viaInternet}: They are only relevant if you uses a program
only for yourself (4yourself) \textbf{and} [ (if that AGPL licensed program has
been modified \{proapse and modified\}) \textbf{or} (if that program uses an
embedded AGPL licensed library \{snimoli and embedded\}) ].
