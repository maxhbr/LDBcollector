    <p>"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all 
other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common 
control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
 means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or 
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) 
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or 
(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

    <p>"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>

modifications, including but not limited to software source code, 
documentation source, and configuration files.</p>

    <p>"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not 
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and 
conversions to other media types.</p>

    <p>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example
 is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

    <p>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or 
Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which 
the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For
 the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works 
that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

    <p>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the 
original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that 
Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to

Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>

    <p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal 
Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor

    <p>2. Grant of Copyright License.</p>

    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, 
prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source 
or Object form.</p>

    <p>3. Grant of Patent License.</p>

    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) 
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
 otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those 
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
 Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
 You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.</p>

    <p>4. Redistribution.</p>

    <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
 Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

    <ol><li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</li>

      <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</li>

      <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution 
notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that 
do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

      <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
 a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
 file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 
NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
 Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the 
NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE 
text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License.</li>
    </ol><p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
 or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated in this License.</p>

    <p>5. Submission of Contributions.</p>

    <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor
 shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing 
herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license 
agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such 
Contributions.</p>

    <p>6. Trademarks.</p>

    <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as 
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of 
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

    <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>

    <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
 License.</p>

    <p>8. Limitation of Liability.</p>

    <p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
 negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
 shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
 of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
 all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</p>

    <p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You 
may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, 
You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not
 on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred 
by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
