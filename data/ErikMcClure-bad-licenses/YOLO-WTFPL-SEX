EXCEPTIONS TO THIS LICENSE:
---------------------------

A notable exception goes to the Lead Programmer for YU-RIS Engine
Known online as Honowi / Honoppe.
I hated every single second of guessing how the fuck does YU-RIS
use all the stupid ass microfunctions you wrote without documentation.
This exception will not apply if the subject gets to lose his virginity
to someone that's not a Dia Kurosawa lifesize dakimakura.

Another exception goes to progvian, from the Fuwanovel Forums.
You could've made your damn YU-RIS text replacer code open source.
That would've saved me the trouble of finding another tool fit for the job.
This exception will not apply if the subject makes YU-RIS text replacer open-source.
