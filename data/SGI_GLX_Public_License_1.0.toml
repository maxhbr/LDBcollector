All GLX code now uses Free B 2.0  The GLX 1.0 license is non-free, and yet, it
was in use in XFree86 and Xorg for many years. In 2008, SGI created the SGI Free
B 2.0 License (containing identical text to the MIT license), and migrated all
GLX 1.0 code owned by SGI to the SGI Free B 2.0 license. (http://www.sgi.com/com
pany_info/newsroom/press_releases/2008/september/opengl.html)  A copy of the GLX
1.0 is archived here, taken from http://web.archive.org/web/20061104002735/www.s
