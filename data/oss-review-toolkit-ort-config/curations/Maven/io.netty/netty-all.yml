# Netty uses version with 'x.x.x.FINAL' which is interpreted as a pre-release version by Semver4j. The actual version
# range for this curation is '[4.1.69.Final,4.1.101.Final]', which isn't interpreted as a valid version range by
# Semver4j. Therefore using a version range without the '.Final'.

      The JAR files of these netty-all versions do not contain any classes files nor do they distribute any
      *-sources.jar, see e.g. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-all/4.1.69.Final/.
