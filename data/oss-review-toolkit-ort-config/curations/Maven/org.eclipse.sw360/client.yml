      No SCM tag is in the POM, and no sources artifact is published.

      The version is not correctly tagged in the repository. Found the correct version by comparing the build date
      of this weekly build (2021-04-17) with the latest commit before that date.
    vcs:
      revision: "4bf2932ba060384f5cd6975ef0e1fac78692dca8"
