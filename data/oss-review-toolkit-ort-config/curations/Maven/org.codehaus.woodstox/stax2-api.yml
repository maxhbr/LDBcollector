      The POM links to http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php which forwards to
      https://opensource.org/license/BSD-2-Clause. Also, version 4.2.2 fixed the declared license (see
      https://github.com/FasterXML/stax2-api/blob/stax2-api-4.2.2/pom.xml#L30), and a LICENSE file was added recently
      (see https://github.com/FasterXML/stax2-api/commit/67d598842d99266a43d7ecf839c2b1f0f70f2bdc).
    declared_license_mapping:
      "The BSD License": "BSD-2-Clause"
