      The SCM tags from the POMs are outdated. As the "junit-dep" artifacts are the same as the ones from Maven group ID
      "junit" except that dependencies are not bundled but declared, it is correct use "junit" source code. See e.g. the
      message in https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit-dep/4.11/junit-dep-4.11.pom.
    vcs:
      type: "Git"
      url: "https://github.com/junit-team/junit4.git"
