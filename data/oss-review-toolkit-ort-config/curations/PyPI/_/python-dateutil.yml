      The LICENSE file states that contributions after 2017-12-01 as well as older
      contributions that have been re-licensed fall under Apache-2.0, and non-relicensed
      older contributions fall under BSD-3-Clause. However, it also
      says that "The above BSD License Applies to all code, even that also covered by Apache 2.0" [1],
      meaning that all code in total falls under Apache-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause.
      This seems to contradict the declared "Dual License" [2], which usually implies a choice between
      the licenses. So even if Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause might have been intended, the wording
      says something else, and sticking to Apache-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause is the conservative conclusion.
