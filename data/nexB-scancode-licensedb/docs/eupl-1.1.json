Disclaimer of Liability \n \nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural \npersons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or \nmoral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, \nincluding without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer \nfailure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor \nhas been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be \nliable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. \n \n9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own \nbehalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any \nother Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each \nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such \nContributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. \n\n10. Acceptance of the Licence \n \nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \"I agree\" \nplaced under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by \naffirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable \nlaw. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this \nLicence and all of its terms and conditions.  \n \nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by \nexercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of \nthe Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or \nCommunication by You of the Work or copies thereof.  \n \n11.

Miscellaneous \n \nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement \nbetween the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. \n \nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this \nwill not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision \nwill be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. \n \nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions \nof this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of \nthe rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with \na unique version number. \n \nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have \nidentical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.  \n   \n14.

Applicable Law \n \nThis Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the \nLicensor resides or has his registered office. \n \nThis licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: \n \n- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any \nLicensee; \n- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or \nregistered office inside a European Union country."
