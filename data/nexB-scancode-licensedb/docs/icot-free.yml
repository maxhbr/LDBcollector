  \ Revised ICOT Free Software after its release\n\n\n1. Purposes and Background of ICOT Free\
  \ Software.\n\n    The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (\"ICOT\")\nhad been\
  \ promoting the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project under\nthe commitment of the Ministry\
  \ of International Trade and Industry of\nJapan (the \"MITI\").  Since April 1993, ICOT has\
  \ been promoting the\nFollow-on project to the FGCS project. This follow-on project aims to\n\
  disseminate and further develop FGCS technology. The FGCS project and\nthe Follow-on project\
  \ (collectively, the \"Project\") have been aimed at\ncreating basic technology for novel\
  \ computers that realizes parallel\ninference processing as their core mechanism, and contributing\
  \ toward\nthe progress of computer science by sharing innovative knowledge and\ntechnology\
  \ with the research community worldwide.\n\n    Innovative hardware and software parallel\
  \ inference technology\nhas been under development through the Project, which involves\nvarieties\
  \ of advanced software for experiments and evaluation. This\nsoftware, being at a basic stage\
  \ of research and development, should\nbe disseminated widely to the research community.\n\
  \n    According to the aims of the Project, ICOT has made this\nsoftware, the copyright of\
  \ which does not belong to the government but\nto ICOT itself, available to the public in\
  \ order to contribute to the\nworld, and, moreover, has removed all restrictions on its usage\
  \ that\nmay have impeded further research and development in order that large\nnumbers of\
  \ researchers can use it freely to begin a new era of\ncomputer science.\n\n    This program\
  \ together with any attached documentation (collec-\ntively, the \"Program\") is being distributed\
  \ by ICOT free of charge as\nICOT Free Software.\n\n\n2. Free Use, Modification, Copying and\

  \ but is not limited to, any act to improve or\nexpand the Program for the purposes of enhancing\
  \ and/or improving its\nfunction, performance and/or quality as well as to add one or more\n\
  programs or documents developed by Users of the Program.\n\n    Each User may also freely\

  \ over the User or the intended distribution itself.\n\n\n3. NO WARRANTY\n\n    The program\
  \ was produced on an experimental basis in the\ncourse of the research and development conducted\
  \ during the project\nand is provided to users as so produced on an experimental basis. \n\
  Accordingly, the program is provided without any warranty whatsoever,\nwhether express, implied,\
  \ statutory or otherwise. The term \"warranty\"\nused herein includes, but is not limited\

  \ for any and all\ndamages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental\n\
  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection\nwith the use or inability\
  \ to use the program or any product, material\nor result produced or otherwise obtained by\
  \ using the program,\nregardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had\n\
  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the\nproject or thereafter.\
  \ Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the\nforegoing by his or her commencement of\
