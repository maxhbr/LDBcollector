  "text": "Exception for Applications Version 1.04, January 18, 2013\n\nException Intent\n\nWe want people to be able to build Free/Libre and Open Source Software (\"FLOSS\") applications using Sencha SDKs despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 3.0 of the GNU General Public License (the \"GPL\").\n\nThis Exception is intended to be used for end-user applications and is not intended to be applied to software development libraries or toolkits, as per section 2(d) below. For development libraries, please refer to the Open Source License Exception for Development.\nTerms and Conditions\nDefinitions\n\n    Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.\n    \"Library\" means Ext JS, Sencha Touch or Sencha GXT, for which this exception is applicable.\n    \"Derivative Work\" means derivative works as defined by US copyright law.\n\nAdditional Grants\n\nAs a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:\n\nYou are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Library and one or more works (each, a \"FLOSS Work\") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 5, as long as:\n\n    You obey the GPL in all respects for the Library and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves\n    All identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves, are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and\n    The object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and\n    Any works which are aggregated with the Library or with a Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Library, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.\n    The Derivative Work can reasonably be considered independent and separate work that is intended for use by end-users and not as a library for software development purposes.\n\nApplicability\n\nThis exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later, Sencha Touch 1.0 or later and Sencha GXT version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a conspicuous notice with the Derivative Work and conspicuously posted online near any download location, saying that Derivative Works built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception and that the included Library is subject to the terms of the GPL v3.\n\nThis Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any license other than the GPL v3.\nTermination\n\nIf you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.\nOpen Source License List\nLicense name     Version(s)/Copyright Date\nAcademic Free License    2.0\nApache Software License    2.0\nApple Public Source License    2.0\nArtistic license    From Perl 5.8.0\nBSD license    \"July 22 1999\"\nCommon Development and Distribution License (CDDL)    1.0\nCommon Public License    1.0\nEclipse Public License    1.0\nEducational Community License    2.0\nEuropean Union Public License (EUPL)    1.1\nGNU General Public License (GPL)    2.0\nGNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License (LGPL)    3.0\nJabber Open Source License    1.0\nMIT License (As listed in file MIT-License.txt)    -\nMozilla Public License (MPL)    1.0/1.1/2.0\nOpen Software License    2.0\nOpenSSL license (with original SSLeay license)    \"2003\" (\"1998\")\nPHP License    3.0\nPython license (CNRI Python License)    -\nPython Software Foundation License    2.1.1\nSleepycat License    \"1999\"\nUniversity of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License    -\nW3C License    \"2001\"\nX11 License    \"2001\"\nZimbra Public License    1.3\nZlib/libpng License    -\nZope Public License    2.0"
