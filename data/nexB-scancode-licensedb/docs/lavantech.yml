  \ to this Agreement except in writing signed by you and LavanTech. If you do not agree to\
  \ the terms and conditions of the Agreement, discontinue use of the Software immediately.\n\
  1. License Grant \nIn consideration for the license fee paid, and other good and valuable\
  \ consideration, LavanTech grants to you only, the Licensee, the non-exclusive, world-wide\
  \ right to use the Software in accordance with the license You purchase. If you are using\
  \ this product for your employer, this agreement also includes your employer.\nTrial/Demo\
  \ License\nSoftware that is distributed as Trial/Demo may only be used for testing and evaluation\
  \ purposes by a single Developer. The Trial/Demo Software cannot be distributed as part of\
  \ your software. The software license is valid only for 30 days from the time of download\
  \ or installation. The Trial/Demo Software should be destroyed after the Trial period.\n\n\
  Developer License \nSingle Developer License allows one developer to use the Software for\
  \ development and integration of any number of applications. If you have more than one developer\
  \ that will be developing applications using the Software, You will need to purchase a Developer\
  \ License for each additional Developer.  The 5 Developer License grants the rights of the\
  \ Developer License for up to 5 developers. The Enterprise Developer License grants the rights\
  \ of the Developer License for unlimited number of Developers within a same organization.\
  \ Personal/Non-Commercial Developer License grants the rights of the Developer License for\
  \ one Developer for Non-Commercial Purposes. \"Non-Commercial Purposes\" means use of the\
  \ software by an individual who does not directly or indirectly support any commercial efforts.\n\
  \nThe Developer License allows the developer royalty-free unlimited distribution of the Software\
  \ bundled with an application, provided You adhere to the following distribution terms:\n\
  •\tYou may not resell, rent, lease or distribute the Software alone. The Software must be\
  \ distributed as a component of an application and bundled with an application or with the\
  \ application's installation files. The Software may only be used as part of, and in connection\
  \ with, the bundled application.\n•\tYou may not resell, rent, lease or distribute Software\
  \ in any way that would compete with LavanTech.\n•\tYou shall protect and keep secure all\
  \ source code provided with Software. All source code provided with Software that is distributed\
  \ with an application must be compiled or password protected to the extent that only the software\
  \ developer(s) may obtain access to it.\n•\tA valid copyright notice must be provided within\
  \ the user documentation, start-up screen or in the help-about section of your application\
  \ that specifies LavanTech as the provider of the Software bundled with Your application,\
  \ for example: \"<<your application name>> contains components licensed from LavanTech. These\
  \ components may only be used as part of and in connection with <<your application name>>.\"\
  \n\nSource Code License If a source code license is purchased, LavanTech grants you the right\
  \ to use and modify the LavanTech source under the following condition.\n•\tLavanTech shall\
  \ retain all right, title and interest in and to all updates, modifications, enhancements\
  \ and derivative works, in whole or in part, of the LavanTech Source Code created by you,\
  \ including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such modifications, enhancements\
  \ or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the LavanTech\
  \ source code; provided, however, that LavanTech grants to you a fully-paid, royalty free\
  \ license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative\
  \ works or copies thereof for use as authorized in this License.\n•\tYou may not distribute\
  \ the LavanTech source code, or any modified version or derivative work of the LavanTech source\
  \ code, in source code form.\n•\tLavanTech require all developers who plan to access LavanTech\
  \ source code signing on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered\
  \ developers. An alternative to this is to let a delegate signs source code license as an\
  \ organization. The delegate will be responsible for letting other developers who plan to\
  \ access the source code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the\
  \ access.\n•\tThe source code contained herein and in related files is provided to the registered\
  \ developer for the purposes of education and troubleshooting. Under no circumstances may\
  \ any portion of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to\
  \ any third party without the express written consent of LavanTech.\n•\tUnder no circumstances\
  \ may the source code be used in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that\
  \ provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any LavanTech products.\n\
  •\tThe registered developer acknowledges that this source code contains valuable and proprietary\
  \ trade secrets of LavanTech. The registered developer agrees to expend every effort to insure\
  \ its confidentiality. For example, under no circumstances may the registered developer allow\
  \ to put the source code on an internal network where he or she has no control.\n•\tDue to\
  \ the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to use classes that built from the source\
  \ code directly, you must agree to obfuscate the classes before distributing it to your customers.\n\
