  "text": "TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION\n\n0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in\nthis License Agreement, have the following meanings:\n\n0.1 Author: \"Author\" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original\nWork (the \"Program\") released by the Author under this License\nAgreement.\n\n0.2 Copy: \"Copy\" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a\ncopy according to copyright law, without limitation. A \"copy\" does not\nbecome anything other than a \"copy\" merely because, for example, a\ngovernmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a\npart of it for another employee of the same institution or\nGovernmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer\nto another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made\non the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental\nEntity.\n\n0.3 Derivative Work: A \"Derivative Work\" or \"work based on the\nProgram\" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing\nthe Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification.\"). In the\nunlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual\ndefinition of \"Derivative Work\" is later determined by any tribunal or\ndispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of\n\"derivative work\" under the copyright law of any country, then the\nbroadest and most encompassing possible definition either the\ncontractual definition of \"Derivative Work,\" or any broader and more\nencompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control. Acceptance\nof this contractually-defined scope of the term \"Derivative Work\" is a\nmandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered\nby this License Agreement.\n\n0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\nwork under the scope of this License Agreement.\n\n0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms\n\"this License\" or \"this License Agreement\" shall mean The Hactivismo\nEnhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent\nversion made applicable under the terms of Section 15.\n\n0.5 Licensee: The term \"Licensee\" shall mean You or any other\nLicensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.\n\n0.6 Original Work: \"Original Work\" shall mean a Program or other work\nof authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.\n\n0.7 Program: The \"Program,\" to which this License Agreement applies,\nis the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer\nsoftware) released by the Author under this License Agreement.\n\n0.8 Qualified Licensee: A \"Qualified Licensee\" means a Licensee that\nremains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this\nLicense Agreement. You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any\ntime, You violate any terms of this License Agreement. Neither the\nProgram nor any Software based on the Program may be copied,\ndistributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for\nYour own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee\nother than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and\nconditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each\ncumulative violation as set forth herein. Loss of the status of\nQualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the\nLicense Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits\nthat Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to\nadditional remedies for all violations occurring after the first\nviolation.\n\n0.9 Software: \"Software\" or \"the Software\" shall mean the Program, any\nDerivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any\nmodified version of the Program or portion thereof, without\nlimitation.\n\n0.10 Source Code: The term \"Source Code\" shall mean the preferred form\nof a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all\navailable documentation describing how to access and modify that\nProgram or Original Work.\n\n0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the\nSource Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the\nSource Code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n0.10.2 \"Object Code:\" Because of certain peculiarities of current\nexport-control rules, \"object code\" of the Program, or any modified\nversion of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must\nnot be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the\ndistribution of the Source Code. The \"Source Code\" shall be understood\nas the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the \"object\ncode\" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such\nexport distribution.\n\n0.11 Strong Cryptography: \"Strong Cryptography\" shall mean\ncryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation)\na 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key\nsize for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for\nAES and similar symmetric ciphers.\n\n0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term \"Substandard\nKey-Selection Technique\" shall mean a method or technique to cause\nencryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by\n(i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii)\nemploying a selection process that selects among only a subset of\npossible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys\nthat can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about\nthe cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following\nillustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition:\n\n0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\nencryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more\nprime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or\nconcatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime\nnumber should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime\nnumbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime\nnumbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for\nexample, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security),\nand absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes\nthat makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a\nsecure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the\nprimes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If\nthere is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security\nassociated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\ncryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements\nof Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection\ntechnique no less secure than the customary industry standard for\nsecure use of the cryptosystem.\n\n0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\nencryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random\ninteger, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more\nmathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at\nrandom from the largest possible set of all possible integers\nconsistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It\nshall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers\n(e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could\nnot set 200 of the 256 bits as \"0,\" and randomly generate only the\nremaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of\nusing the full 256 bits).\n\n0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote\nsecurity to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic\nmethod(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating\neavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM\ntelephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at\n\"0,\" thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of\n65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce\nthe security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a\nless-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and\nwill violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed\nin any Software.\n\n0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that\nhave violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified\nLicensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of\nthis License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each\nsuccessive violation), is referred to as \"You.\"\n\n0.13.1 Governmental Entity: \"You\" explicitly includes any and all\n\"Governmental Entities,\" without limitation. \"Governmental Entity\" or\n\"Governmental Entities,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall\nmean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and\nwithout limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal\ngovernments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other\nsuch entities), governmental subunits (without limitation,\ngovernmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations,\nand the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the\nEuropean Union, and entities through which one or more governments\nperform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in\ncoordination, cooperation or unison.\n\n0.13.2 Governmental Person: \"You\" also explicitly includes\n\"Governmental Persons.\" The terms \"Governmental Person\" or\n\"Governmental Persons,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall\nmean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors\nand agents of any Governmental Entity.\n\n1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to\nany Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a\nnotice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the\nterms of this License Agreement. The preferred manner of placing such\na notice is to include the following statement immediately after the\ncopyright notice for such an Original Work:\n\n    \"Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License\n    Agreement, Version 0.1\"\n\n2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By\nAnyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the\nspecial case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying,\nmodification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any\nSoftware, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions\nof this License Agreement.\n\n2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person\nto use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it\n(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such\nperson has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee\nsubject to all its terms and conditions.\n\n2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have\naccepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its\nterms and conditions.\n\n2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or\ntransfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee\nthat has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to\nall terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\n\n2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers\nan exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy\nthe Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the\nSoftware shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License\nAgreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of\na copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient\nLicensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access,\nuse, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the\nterms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees\nis effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a\ncopy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting\nthe License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's\nobligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or\naccess.\n\n3. \"Qualified Licensee\" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied,\ndistributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for\nYour own purposes, unless You are a \"Qualified Licensee.\" To remain a\nQualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms\nand conditions of this License Agreement.\n\n4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:\n\n4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any\ncopy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or\ndistribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your\nrights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative\nremedies for each successive violation that may be available to the\nAuthor. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You\n(and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License\nAgreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees,\nwill not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or\nrestricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to\nthe time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License\nAgreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify,\ndistribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released\nunder this License Agreement. However, nothing else grants You\npermission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in\nobject code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify,\nor to distribute the Program or any Software based on the\nProgram. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this\nLicense Agreement. Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use,\ncopying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this\nLicense Agreement by You.\n\n4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or\nDerivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\nreceives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute,\nmodify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility\nof the Author.\n\n5. Grant of Source Code License.\n\n5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises\nand agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to\nprovide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at\nthe request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this\nobligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of\nthe most current version of the Program in an information repository\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by\nYou for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by\npublishing the address of that information repository in a notice\nimmediately following the copyright notice that applies to the\nProgram. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not\nnecessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code\naccompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of\ncompiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source\nCode from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have\n(for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current,\ncopy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You\nfrom exporting copies to others without violating this license, see\nSection 8).\n\n5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a\nQualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License\nAgreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the\nfollowing:\n\n5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;\n\n5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit\nor modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative\nWorks;\n\n5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work\nand/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of\nOriginal Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be\nlicensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform\nall recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.\n\n6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You\nremain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this\nLicense Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the\nfollowing:\n\n6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;\n\n6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon\nSoftware that itself is based on the Program;\n\n6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by\ndistributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must\nbe ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program\nand Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the\nProgram or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed\nunder this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all\nrecipients of the terms of this License Agreement;\n\n6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;\n\n6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and\n\n6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the\nProgram (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in\nexchange for a fee).\n\n7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You\nremain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this\nLicense Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement,\nunder patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are\nembodied in the Program as furnished by the Author (\"Licensed Claims\")\nto make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the\nproviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive,\nroyalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any\nDerivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a\nworld-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license\nunder the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale\nDerivative Works.\n\n8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License\nAgreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,\ncopyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property\nof Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\ngranted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent\nclaims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7. No right\nis granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included\nin the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted\nto prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms\nfrom this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative\nWork that Author otherwise would have a right to License.\n\n8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author\n(in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo,\nthe name \"Hacktivismo\"), nor the names of contributors who helped\nproduce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of\nthe Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the\nProgram, without specific prior written permission of the\nAuthor. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any\ncontributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or\npromote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement\nby any person other than Hacktivismo.\n\n9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may\nmodify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You\nare a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or\nprepare or distribute Derivative Works (including permission to\nprepare and/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections\n5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the\nfollowing mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive):\n\n9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that You changed the files and the date of any change;\n\n9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive\nuse in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and\ntelling the user how to view a copy of this License\nAgreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\nnot normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.);\n\n9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original\nWork, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the\nsecurity of the Software or the end-user's expectations of privacy,\nanonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including\n(without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any\n\"backdoor,\" escrow mechanism, \"spy-ware,\" or surveillance techniques\nor methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;\n\n9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security,\nprivacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and/or trust methods or\ntechniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that\nincludes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques\nin the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.\n\n9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection\ntechnique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique.\n\n9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit\nor communicate any symmetric key, any \"private key\" if an asymmetric\ncryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it\notherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person\nother than the end-user who generated the key, without the active\nconsent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or\nsymmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be\nstored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading\n(at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other\ntechniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is\neven stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.\n\n10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.\n\n10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on\nthe Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1\nthrough 10.1.5, inclusive):\n\n10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any\nperson of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of\nprivacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom,\ndue process of law, and individual conscience;\n\n10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any\nperson of human rights;\n\n10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive\nany person of human rights, including not only the above-listed\nrights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical\nrestraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from\ntorture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or\nthrough lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from\nself-incrimination;\n\n10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals,\nwhether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by\nany non-governmental person or entity;\n\n10.1.5 censorship or \"filtering\" of any published information or expression.\n\n10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by\nany Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or\npractice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human\nrights of any persons.\n\n10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including,\nwithout limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to\nuse the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it\n(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such\nperson has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee\nsubject to all its terms and conditions, including (without\nlimitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2,\ninclusive.\n\n11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to\nDistribution of Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of\ncurrent export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or\nany Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or\nSource Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not\nexport any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an\nexport distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be\nancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium,\nor by a method, customarily used for software interchange.\n\n12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE\nEXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply\nwith any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the\nUnited States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or\ntransmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations\n(including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,\nNorth Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is\nidentified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of\nsome other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq,\nLibya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of\nthese countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software\ndirectly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of\ntheir members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a\nviolation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the\ncurrent laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You,\nbefore exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should\nbe taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination. An Author other\nthan Hacktivismo may substitute that Author's legal name for\n\"Hacktivismo\" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released\nby that Author under this Paragraph.\n\n13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a\nconsequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are\nimposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not\nexcuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations\nunder this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then\nas a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For\nexample, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly\nor indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it\nand this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the software distribution system reflected in this\nLicense Agreement, which is implemented by public license\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide\nrange of software distributed through related distribution systems, in\nreliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is\nup to the Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\n14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity (\"Governmental\nEntity\" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or\nGovernmental Person (as \"Governmental Person\" is defined broadly in\nSection 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays,\nperforms, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative\nWork based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the\nfollowing terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are\nagreed to and fully met:\n\n14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case\nof any \"Governmental Person,\" if it is the position of that\nGovernmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or\ndoctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of\nimmunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this\nLicense Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against\nsuch Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such\nGovernmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change,\ndisplay, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof,\nby the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that\nGovernmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to\ninform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to\nrender this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully\nenforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental\nPerson of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what\nadditional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully\nenforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the\nrequired written notice to the Author in advance of any such use,\nmodification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution,\nshall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all\nreliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not\nincluded or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure\nto provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is\nirrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written\nnotice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the\nGovernmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use,\nchange, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of\nthe Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License\nAgreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the\nGovernmental Entity, that such entity concedes is\nfully-enforceable.
