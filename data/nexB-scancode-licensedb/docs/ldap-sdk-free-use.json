Certain states do not allow the exclusion of implied\nwarranties or limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so the\nexclusion of limited warranties and limitation of liability set forth above may\nnot apply to You.\n\nEXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The SDK is subject to United States export control laws.\nYou acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for compliance with all\ndomestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the SDK.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS.
