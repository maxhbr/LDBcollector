  \ to remove this button, it is requested that the\n   attribution remain. A significant investment\
  \ has been put\n   into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community\n   continues\
  \ to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.\n\n4. All advertising materials and documentation\
