Licenses.\n\n    (a) License to Dgraph Core.  The License for Dgraph\n        Core is the Apache License, Version 2.0 (\"Apache License\").\n        The Apache License includes a grant of patent license, as well as\n        redistribution rights that are contingent on several requirements.\n        Please see\n\n            http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n        for full terms.  Dgraph Core is a no-cost, entry-level license and as\n        such, contains the following disclaimers: NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO\n        THE CONTRARY HEREIN, DGRAPH CORE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS\n        AVAILABLE\", AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AND\n        DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\n        AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM\n        COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USE IN TRADE.  For\n        clarity, the terms of this Agreement, other than the relevant\n        definitions in Section 1 and this Section 2(a) do not apply to Dgraph\n        Core.\n\n    (b) License to Dgraph Enterprise Edition.\n\n      i   Grant of Copyright License: Subject to the terms of this Agreement,\n          Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive,\n          non-transferable limited license to reproduce, prepare Enterprise\n          Derivative Works (as defined below) of, publicly display, publicly\n          perform, sublicense, and distribute Dgraph Enterprise Edition\n          for Your business purposes, for so long as You are not in violation\n          of this Section 2(b) and are current on all payments required by\n          Section 4 below.\n\n      ii  Grant of Patent License: Subject to the terms of this Agreement,\n          Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive,\n          non-transferable limited patent license to make, have made, use,\n          offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Dgraph\n          Enterprise Edition, where such license applies only to those patent\n          claims licensable by Licensor that are necessarily infringed by\n          their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their\n          Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was\n          submitted.  If You institute patent litigation against any entity\n          (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n          the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes\n          direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as\n          of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n      iii License to Third Party Works:  From time to time Dgraph Labs may\n          use, or provide You access to, Third Party Works in connection\n          Dgraph Enterprise Edition.  You acknowledge and agree that in\n          addition to this Agreement, Your use of Third Party Works is subject\n          to all other terms and conditions set forth in the License provided\n          with or contained in such Third Party Works.  Some Third Party Works\n          may be licensed to You solely for use with Dgraph Enterprise\n          Edition under the terms of a third party License, or as otherwise\n          notified by Dgraph Labs, and not under the terms of this\n          Agreement.  You agree that the owners and third party licensors of\n          Third Party Works are intended third party beneficiaries to this\n          Agreement.\n\n  3. Support.  From time to time, in its sole discretion, Dgraph Labs may\n     offer professional services or support for Dgraph, which may now or in\n     the future be subject to additional fees.\n\n  4. Fees for Dgraph Enterprise Edition or Dgraph Support.\n\n    (a) Fees.  The License to Dgraph Enterprise Edition is conditioned upon\n        Your payment of the fees which You agree to pay to Dgraph Labs in\n        accordance with the payment terms agreed upon by contacting\n        contact@dgraph.io.  Any professional services or support for Dgraph\n        may also be subject to Your payment of fees, which will be\n        specified by Dgraph Labs when you sign up to receive such\n        professional services or support.  Dgraph Labs reserves the right\n        to change the fees at any time with prior written notice; for\n        recurring fees, any such adjustments will take effect as of the\n        next pay period.\n\n    (b) Overdue Payments and Taxes. Overdue payments are subject to a service\n        charge equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal\n        interest rate allowed by law, and You shall pay all Dgraph Labs\u2019\n        reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorneys\u2019\n        fees.  Fees are stated and payable in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of\n        all sales, use, value added and similar taxes, duties, withholdings and\n        other governmental assessments (but excluding taxes based on Dgraph\n        Labs\u2019 income) that may be levied on the transactions contemplated by\n        this Agreement in any jurisdiction, all of which are Your responsibility\n        unless you have provided Dgraph Labs with a valid tax-exempt\n        certificate.\n\n    (c) Record-keeping and Audit.  If fees for Dgraph Enterprise Edition\n        are based on the number of cores or servers running on Dgraph\n        Enterprise Edition or another use-based unit of measurement, You must\n        maintain complete and accurate records with respect to Your use of\n        Dgraph Enterprise Edition and will provide such records to\n        Dgraph Labs for inspection or audit upon Dgraph Labs\u2019 reasonable\n        request.  If an inspection or audit uncovers additional usage by You for\n        which fees are owed under this Agreement, then You shall pay for such\n        additional usage at Dgraph Labs\u2019 then-current rates.\n\n  5. Trial License.  If You have signed up for a trial or evaluation of\n     Dgraph Enterprise Edition, Your License to Dgraph Enterprise\n     Edition is granted without charge for the trial or evaluation period\n     specified when You signed up, or if no term was specified, for thirty (30)\n     calendar days, provided that Your License is granted solely for purposes of\n     Your internal evaluation of Dgraph Enterprise Edition during the trial\n     or evaluation period (a \"Trial License\").  You may not use Dgraph\n     Enterprise Edition under a Trial License more than once in any twelve (12)\n     month period.  Dgraph Labs may revoke a Trial License at any time and\n     for any reason.  Sections 3, 4, 9 and 11 of this Agreement do not apply to\n     Trial Licenses.\n\n  6. Redistribution.  You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or\n     Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and\n     in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\n    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a\n        copy of this License; and\n\n    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n        that You changed the files; and\n\n    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You\n        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices\n        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not\n        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution,\n        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable\n        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,\n        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the\n        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a\n        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the\n        Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative\n        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n        wherever such third-party notices normally appear.  The contents of the\n        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the\n        License.  You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative\n        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE\n        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices\n        cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may\n        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,\n        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such\n        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and\n        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated\n        in this License.\n\n    (e) Enterprise Derivative Works: Derivative Works of Dgraph Enterprise\n        Edition (\"Enterprise Derivative Works\") may be made, reproduced and\n        distributed in any medium, with or without modifications, in Source or\n        Object form, provided that each Enterprise Derivative Work will be\n        considered to include a License to Dgraph Enterprise Edition and\n        thus will be subject to the payment of fees to Dgraph Labs by any\n        user of the Enterprise Derivative Work.\n\n  7. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any\n     Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Dgraph by You to\n     Dgraph Labs shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\n         https://cla-assistant.io/dgraph-io/dgraph\n\n     (which is based off of the Apache License), without any additional terms or\n     conditions, payments of royalties or otherwise to Your benefit.\n     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the\n     terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed with\n     Dgraph Labs regarding such Contributions.\n\n  8. Trademarks.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\n     trademarks, service marks, or product names of Licensor, except as required\n     for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\n     reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n  9. Limited Warranty.\n\n    (a) Warranties.  Dgraph Labs warrants to You that: (i) Dgraph\n        Enterprise Edition will materially perform in accordance with the\n        applicable documentation for ninety (90) days after initial delivery to\n        You; and (ii) any professional services performed by Dgraph Labs\n        under this Agreement will be performed in a workmanlike manner, in\n        accordance with general industry standards.\n\n    (b) Exclusions.  Dgraph Labs\u2019 warranties in this Section 9 do not extend\n        to problems that result from: (i) Your failure to implement updates\n        issued by Dgraph Labs during the warranty period; (ii) any\n        alterations or additions (including Enterprise Derivative Works and\n        Contributions) to Dgraph not performed by or at the direction of\n        Dgraph Labs; (iii) failures that are not reproducible by Dgraph\n        Labs; (iv) operation of Dgraph Enterprise Edition in violation of\n        this Agreement or not in accordance with its documentation; (v) failures\n        caused by software, hardware or products not licensed or provided by\n        Dgraph Labs hereunder; or (vi) Third Party Works.\n\n    (c) Remedies.  In the event of a breach of a warranty under this Section 9,\n        Dgraph Labs will, at its discretion and cost, either repair, replace\n        or re-perform the applicable Works or services or refund a portion of\n        fees previously paid to Dgraph Labs that are associated with the\n        defective Works or services. This is Your exclusive remedy, and\n        Dgraph Labs\u2019 sole liability, arising in connection with the limited\n        warranties herein.\n\n  10. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Except as set out in Section 9, unless required\n      by applicable law, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor\n      provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR\n      CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, arising out of course\n      of dealing, course of performance, or usage in trade, including, without\n      limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\n      MERCHANTABILITY, CORRECTNESS, RELIABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n      PURPOSE, all of which are hereby disclaimed.  You are solely responsible\n      for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing Works and\n      assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under the\n      applicable License for such Works.\n\n  11. Limited Indemnity.\n\n    (a) Indemnity.  Dgraph Labs will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless\n        against any third party claims, liabilities or expenses incurred\n        (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), as well as amounts finally\n        awarded in a settlement or a non-appealable judgement by a court\n        (\"Losses\"), to the extent arising from any claim or allegation by a\n        third party that Dgraph Enterprise Edition infringes or\n        misappropriates a valid United States patent, copyright or trade secret\n        right of a third party; provided that You give Dgraph Labs: (i)\n        prompt written notice of any such claim or allegation; (ii) sole control\n        of the defense and settlement thereof; and (iii) reasonable cooperation\n        and assistance in such defense or settlement.  If any Work within\n        Dgraph Enterprise Edition becomes or, in Dgraph Labs\u2019 opinion,\n        is likely to become, the subject of an injunction, Dgraph Labs may,\n        at its option, (A) procure for You the right to continue using such\n        Work, (B) replace or modify such Work so that it becomes non-infringing\n        without substantially compromising its functionality, or, if (A) and (B)\n        are not commercially practicable, then (C) terminate Your license to the\n        allegedly infringing Work and refund to You a prorated portion of the\n        prepaid and unearned fees for such infringing Work.  The foregoing\n        states the entire liability of Dgraph Labs with respect to\n        infringement of patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual\n        property rights.\n\n    (b) Exclusions.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to: (i) Works\n        modified by any party other than Dgraph Labs (including Enterprise\n        Derivative Works and Contributions), if the alleged infringement relates\n        to such modification, (ii) Works combined or bundled with any products,\n        processes or materials not provided by Dgraph Labs where the alleged\n        infringement relates to such combination, (iii) use of a version of\n        Dgraph Enterprise Edition other than the version that was current\n        at the time of such use, as long as a non-infringing version had been\n        released, (iv) any Works created to Your specifications, (v)\n        infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in which You\n        have an interest, or (vi) Third Party Works.  You will defend, indemnify\n        and hold Dgraph Labs harmless against any Losses arising from any\n        such claim or allegation, subject to conditions reciprocal to those in\n        Section 11(a).\n\n  12. Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal or equitable\n      theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the\n      contrary, shall Licensor or any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any\n      amounts in excess, in the aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Dgraph\n      Labs under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the date the\n      first cause of liability arose), or (ii) any indirect, special,\n      incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or consequential damages of any\n      character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or\n      inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss\n      of goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer failure or\n      malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or\n      services, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\n      Licensor or Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\n      damages. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE\n      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\n\n  13. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.  While redistributing Works or\n      Derivative Works thereof, and without limiting your obligations under\n      Section 6, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\n      support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights\n      consistent with this License.  However, in accepting such obligations, You\n      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on\n      behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold Dgraph Labs and each other Contributor harmless for\n      any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by\n      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n  14. General.\n\n    (a) Relationship of Parties.  You and Dgraph Labs are independent\n        contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either\n        party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as\n        joint venturers or partners for any purpose.\n\n    (b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\n        Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and\n        regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable\n        U.S. and foreign authority.\n\n    (c) Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may\n        not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the\n        prior written consent of Dgraph Labs.  Any assignment in violation of\n        this provision is void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure\n        to the benefit of, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.\n\n    (d) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under\n        the laws of the State of New York and the United States without regard\n        to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the\n        Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.\n\n    (e) Attorneys\u2019 Fees.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under\n        this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its\n        costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n    (f) Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,\n        illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited\n        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement\n        otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable.\n\n    (g) Entire Agreement; Waivers; Modification.  This Agreement constitutes the\n        entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter\n        hereof and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions,\n        whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this\n        Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. The failure of either\n        party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any\n        period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes,\n        modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in\n        writing and signed by both parties."
