  \ no-charge, transferable license to execute, \nprepare derivative works of, and distribute\
  \ (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial \npurposes, the original code\
  \ contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called \nthe \"\
  Program\").\n\nSection 2.\tDefinitions \n\nA \"Modification\" to the Program is any addition\
  \ to or deletion from the contents of any file of \nthe Program and any new file that contains\
  \ any part of the Program. If you make a Modification and \ndistribute the Program externally\
  \ you are a \"Contributor.\" The distribution of the Program must be under \nthe terms of\
  \ this license including those in Section 3 below. \n\nA \"Combined Work\" results from combining\
  \ and integrating all or parts of the Program with \nother code. A Combined Work may be thought\
  \ of as having multiple parents or being result of multiple \nlines of code development. \n\
  \nSection 3.\tDistribution Licensing Terms \n\nA.\tGeneral Requirements\n\nExcept as necessary\
  \ to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction (see \nbelow), a distribution\
  \ of the Program in any of the forms listed below must not put any \nfurther restrictions\
  \ on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nAs a Contributor, you represent\
  \ that your Modification(s) are your original creation(s) \nand, to the best of your knowledge,\
  \ no third party has any claim (including but not \nlimited to intellectual property claims)\
  \ relating to your Modification(s). You represent \nthat each of your Modifications includes\
  \ complete details of any third-party right or \nother third-party restriction associated\
  \ with any part of your Modification (including a \ncopy of any applicable license agreement).\n\
  \nThe Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically \ntransferring\
  \ the files to the recipient.\n\nThis Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be\
  \ prominently displayed with \nevery distribution of the Program in any form:\n\nYOU AGREE\
  \ THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY \nOF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED).\
  \  ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES \nNO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS\
  \ \nOR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR \nGUARANTEES, INCLUDING,\
  \ WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES \nOF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR\
  \ PURPOSE, AS TO:  \n(A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY \nMODIFICATION,\
  \ A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE \nRESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING\
  \ THE PROGRAM, ANY \nMODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK.   IN NO EVENT \n\
  SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, \nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,\
  \ CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER \nDAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE\
  \ \nGOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS \nINTERRUPTION) HOWEVER\
  \ CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, \nWHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT\
  \ (INCLUDING \nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE \nPROGRAM,\
  \ EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU \nHEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES\
  \ OF ANY KIND AGAINST \nCONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM.\n\nB.\t\
  Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code \n\nIf you distribute the Program in a\
  \ form to which the recipient can make Modifications \n(e.g. source code), the terms of this\
  \ license apply to use by recipient. In addition, each \nsource and data file of the Program\
  \ and any Modification you distribute must contain \nthe following notice: \n\n\"Copyright\
  \ (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, \nInc. and other\
  \ contributors. All rights reserved.  The contents of this file, as updated \nfrom time to\
  \ time by the OCLC Office of Research, are subject to OCLC Research \nPublic License Version\
  \ 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in \ncompliance with the License.\
  \ You may obtain a current copy of the License at \nhttp://purl.oclc.org/oclc/research/ORPL/.\
  \  Software distributed under the License is \ndistributed on an \"AS IS\" basis, WITHOUT\
  \ WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express \nor implied. See the License for the specific language\
  \ governing rights and limitations \nunder the License.  This software consists of voluntary\
  \ contributions made by many \nindividuals on behalf of OCLC Research. For more information\
  \ on OCLC Research, \nplease see http://www.oclc.org/oclc/research/.  The Original Code is\
  \ \n .  The Initial Developer of the Original Code is \n . Portions created by   are \nCopyright\
  \ (C)    . All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s): \n .\"\n\nC.\tRequirements for a Distribution\
  \ of Non-modifiable Code \n\nIf you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient\
  \ cannot make Modifications \n(e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by\
  \ recipient and you must \ninclude the following statement in appropriate and conspicuous\
  \ locations:\n\n\"Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library\
  \ Center, \nInc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.\"\n\nIn addition, the source\
  \ code must be included with the object code distribution or the \ndistributor must provide\
  \ the source code to the recipient upon request.\n\nD.\tRequirements for a Combined Work Distribution\n\
  \nDistributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be \n\
  made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files \n\
  to recipient.\n\nA Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable\
  \ code. The \nrequirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions.\n\
  \nAn \"Aggregate Work\" is when the Program exists, without integration, with other \nprograms\
  \ on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an \nAggregate Work which\
  \ are not covered by the definition of \"Program\" provided in this \nLicense. You are not\
  \ forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program \ncontained in an Aggregate\
  \ Work is subject to this License.  Also, should the Program \nbe extracted from an Aggregate\
  \ Work, this License applies to any use of the Program \napart from the Aggregate Work.\n\n\
  Section 4.\tLicense Grant\n\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC\
  \ and other licensees \nhereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive,\
  \ worldwide, royalty-\nfree, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter,\
  \ delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, \nenhance, develop, publicly display, distribute\
  \ (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works \nbased on your Modifications\
  \ (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section \n4 shall survive\
  \ termination of this License for any reason.\n\nSection 5.\tTermination of Rights\n\nThis\
  \ non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) \nautomatically\
  \ terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement\
  \ (with \nrespect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\
  \nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this\
  \ \nLicense shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days\
  \ of becoming \naware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist\
  \ such termination and are \nproperly granted shall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6.\t\
  Other Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark\
  \ of any of \nthe Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.\
  \  You agree not to remove, \nalter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice\
  \ contained in the Program. \n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be\
  \ made in compliance with U.S. \nimport/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S.\
  \ Department of Commerce, as well as other \nsimilar trade or commerce restrictions which\
  \ might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof\
  \ must include a \nprovision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial\
  \ and noncommercial use by any \nthird party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment\
  \ or settlement relating to intellectual property \ninfringement or any other cause of action,\
  \ conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of \nthis License, such conditions\
  \ do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot \ndistribute the Program\
  \ so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other \nconditions,\
  \ you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\
  \ \nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or\
  \ indirectly through you, \nyou could not satisfy both the patent license and this License,\
  \ and you would be required to refrain \nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf\
  \ you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already\
  \ \ndistributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable\
  \ steps to \ninform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate\
  \ reasonable \nstep to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin\
  \ board. \n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity\
  \ or unenforceability of \nany provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions\
  \ which shall continue in full force and effect.  In \nsubstitution for any provision held\
  \ unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the \noriginal\
  \ intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor\
  \ from time to time may change this License, and the amended \nlicense will apply to all copies\
  \ of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License \ngrants only the\
  \ rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the\
  \ \nintellectual property of any Contributor.\n\n\t\tThis License is the complete and exclusive\
  \ statement of the agreement between the \nparties concerning the subject matter hereof and\
  \ may not be amended except by the written agreement of \nthe parties. This License shall\
  \ be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \nOhio and the\
  \ United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law."
