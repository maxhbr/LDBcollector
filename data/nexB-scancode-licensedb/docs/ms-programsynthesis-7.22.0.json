  "text": "MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\nMICROSOFT PROGRAM SYNTHESIS USING EXAMPLES\n\nThese license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft\u2019s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.\n\n1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.\na) General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices to design, develop and test your non-commercial programs.  Whether a program is non-commercial is determined by the program\u2019s purpose and function, not by whether a fee is charged for the program.  Examples of \u201cnon-commercial programs\u201d are programs written for the purposes of teaching, academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation.   \nb) Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Any included notices for third party applications are for your information only.\n\n2. DATA COLLECTION. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft\u2019s products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft\u2019s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.\n\n3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):\na) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;\nb) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent permitted by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the software;\nc) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;\nd) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or\ne) share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.\n\n4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.\n\n5. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is \u201cas is\u201d, \u201cwith all faults\u201d, and without warranty of any kind.\n\n6. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.\n\n7. PUBLICATION.\na) You may publish (or present papers or articles) on your results from using the software provided that no material or substantial portion of the software is included in any such publication or presentation.   \nb) You will provide Microsoft with a copy of any proposed publication (this includes, without limitation, manuscripts, abstracts, presentations for professional meetings, and other publications) concerning the software, at least thirty (30) days prior to submission for publication.  Microsoft will have 30 days (the \"Pre-publication Review Period\") to review the proposed publication.  At Microsoft\u2019s request, the proposed publication may be delayed for up to 3 months beyond the end of the Pre-publication Review Period.  If Microsoft seeks to delay publication, Microsoft will make such request in writing together with identification of information or materials of concern and reasons why delay is warranted.  You will not unreasonably deny, condition, or delay responding to this request. \n\n8. LICENSE TO MICROSOFT.  In the event you provide Microsoft with feedback about the software, or modification or derivatives of the software, you hereby grant Microsoft, without any restrictions or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable license, to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, post, distribute, make and have made, sell and transfer such feedback, modifications and derivatives in any way and for any purpose, even if such materials are marked or otherwise designated by you as confidential.  These rights survive this agreement. \n\n9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.\n\n10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.\n\n11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\na) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\nb) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\nc) Germany and Austria.\ni.\tWarranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\nii.\tLimitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\nSubject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\n\n12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \u201cAS IS.\u201d YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\n\nThis limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.\n\nPlease note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.\n\nRemarque: Ce logiciel \u00e9tant distribu\u00e9 au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en fran\u00e7ais.\nEXON\u00c9RATION DE GARANTIE.
