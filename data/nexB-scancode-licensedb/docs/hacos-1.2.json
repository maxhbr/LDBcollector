DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HACOS LICENSE VERSION 1.2, THE\nMOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE VERSION 1.1 AND THE NOKIA OPEN SOURCE LICENSE\n(NOKOS LICENSE) VERSION 1.0A\n\nThe HACOS License Version 1.2 was derived from the Mozilla Public\nLicense Version 1.1 using some of the changes to the Mozilla Public\nLicense embodied in the Nokia Open Source License (NOKOS License)\nVersion 1.0a. The differences between the HACOS License Version 1.2\n(this document), the Mozilla Public License and the NOKOS License are\nas follows:\n\ni.    The title of the license was changed to \"Health Administration\n      Corporation Open Source License Version 1.2\".\n\nii.   Globally, all references to \"Netscape Communications Corporation\",\n      \"Mozilla\", \"Nokia\" and \"Nokia Corporation\" were changed to \"Health\n      Administration Corporation\".\n\niii.  Globally, the words \"means\", \"Covered Code\" and \"Covered Software\"\n      as used in the Mozilla Public License were changed to \"shall means\",\n      \"Covered Code\" and \"Covered Software\" respectively, as used in\n      the NOKOS License.\n\niv.   In Section 1 (Definitions), a definition of \"Health Administration\n      Corporation\" was added.\n\nv.    In Section 2, the term \"intellectual property rights\" used in the\n      Mozilla Public License was replaced by the term \"copyrights\"\n      as used in the NOKOS License.\n\nvi.   In Section 2.2 (Contributor Grant), the words \"Subject to the\n      terms of this License\" which appear in the NOKOS License were\n      added to the Mozilla Public License.\n\nvii.  The sentence \"However, You may include an additional document\n      offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\" which\n      appears in the Mozilla Public License was omitted.\n\nviii. Section 6.3 (Derivative Works) of the Mozilla Public License,\n      which permits modifications to the Mozilla Public License,\n      was omitted.\n\nix.   The original Section 9 (Limitation of Liability) was renumbered\n      as Section 9.1, a maximum liability of AUD$100 was specified\n      for those jurisdictions which do not allow complete exclusion of\n      liability but which do allow limitation of liability. The sentence\n      \"NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE LICENSE SHALL PREJUDICE THE STATUTORY\n      RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY DEALING AS A CONSUMER.\", which appears in the\n      NOKOS License but not in the Mozilla Public License, was added.\n\nx.    Section 9.2 was added in order to further limit liability to the\n      maximum extent permitted by the Commonwealth of Australia Trade\n      Practices Act 1974.\n\nxi.   Section 10 of the Mozilla Public License, which provides additional\n      conditions for United States Government End Users, was omitted.\n\nxii.  The governing law and jurisdiction for the settlement of disputes\n      in Section 11 of the Mozilla Public License and Section 10 of the\n      NOKOS License was changed to the laws of the State of New South\n      Wales and the Supreme Court of New South Wales respectively. The\n      exclusion of the application of the United Nations Convention on\n      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods which appears in\n      the Mozilla Public License was omitted.\n\nxiii. Section 13 (Multiple-Licensed Code) of the Mozilla Public License\n      was omitted.\n\nxiv.
