You need not follow the terms of the GNU\nGeneral Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even\nthough portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them.  The GNU\nGeneral Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material\nthat constitutes the Autoconf program.\n\nCertain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied\n(in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of\nAutoconf.  We call these the \"data\" portions.  The rest of the Autoconf\nsource text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which\nof the data portions to output in any given case.  We call these\ncomments and executable code the \"non-data\" portions.  Autoconf never\ncopies any of the non-data portions into its output.\n\nThis special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf\nreleased by the Free Software Foundation.  When you make and\ndistribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special\nexception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless*\nyour modified version has the potential to copy into its output some\nof the text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started\nwith.  (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from\nthe non-data portions to the data portions.)  If your modification has\nsuch potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception\nto the GPL from your modified version."
