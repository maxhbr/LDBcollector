In\naddition, \"Your Product\" means any work in which You include any\n(modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if\nthe work in which you include it is an aggregate software\ndistribution (such as an operating system distribution or a\ncover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate\nproducts, then the term \"Your Product\" includes only those\nproducts (in the aggregate software distribution) that use,\ninclude, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This\nProduct (and the term \"Your Product\" does not include the whole\naggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this\nLicense, a product suite consisting of two or more products is\nconsidered a single product (operating system distributions and\ncover media of magazines are not considered product suites).\n\n5. \"Distribution\" means (and \"distribute\" refers to), regardless\nof means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making\navailable of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third\nparties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your\nProduct, or portions thereof, available for download to third\nparties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the\nproduct, or any portion thereof, made available for download).\n\n\nII.

The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of\n    This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for\n    example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt,\n    TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor\n    any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt\n    (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)\n\n    All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably\n    be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from\n    Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s)\n    included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in/to\n    associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be\n    confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos\n    (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo\n    consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or\n    portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product\n    (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or\n    from Your modified version of This Product) and from any\n    associated materials.\n\n    b.

Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the\n    documentation, the content of the official web site of Your\n    Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address\n    containing the domain name truecrypt (or any domain name\n    that forwards to the domain name truecrypt) in a manner\n    that might suggest that it is where information about Your\n    Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product\n    may be reported or where support for Your Product may be\n    available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain\n    name truecrypt is associated with Your Product.\n\n    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely\n    and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2)\n    at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This\n    condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:\n    (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product\n    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute\n    and You make all such copies of Your Product available to\n    the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include\n    information (valid and correct at least until You cease to\n    distribute Your Product) about where the complete source\n    code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g.,\n    an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee\n    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute\n    and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your\n    Product, You include the aforementioned information about\n    the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web\n    page to which such web site links via an easily viewable\n    hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your\n    Product).\n\n    The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately\n    obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g.,\n    the output of a preprocessor).

The license(s)\n    must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge,\n    and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict,\n    interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect\n    any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The\n    text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy\n    of Your Product that You make and distribute.\n\n    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in\n    any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the\n    license terms even if the original terms are retained),\n    which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put\n    under another license. You must keep intact all the legal\n    notices contained in the source code files. You must include\n    the following items with every copy of Your Product that You\n    make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating\n    that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),\n    a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about\n    where the included copy of the License can be found, and an\n    appropriate copyright notice.\n\n\n2.
