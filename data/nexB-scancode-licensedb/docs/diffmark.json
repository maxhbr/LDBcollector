  "notes": "Per Fedora, this extremely minimal and permissive license was found in\ndiffmark (0.08). While poorly written, our interpretation of the text\npermits use, modification, and distribution. It also permits wearing it as\na hat or eating it for lunch, although neither of those cases are\nrecommended. This would perhaps be considered Copyright only, except that\nno requirement of retention of copyright is present, and the copyright\nholder is disclaiming liability (albeit, poorly). This license is Free, and\nGPL compatible.\n",
