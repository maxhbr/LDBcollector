  \ to Installation and Authorization Questions\n- Product Use Guidance\n- Problem Diagnosis\n\
  - Software Program Configuration Help\n- Software Program Updates\n- New Media and documentation\n\
  - New Versions of the Software Program\n\nThese services exclude explicitly:\n- Third-Party\
  \ Products\n- Hardware Platform Related Support\n- Operating System Related Support\n- Integration\
  \ Advice or Any Other Consulting\n- Training.  TSI maintains training and consulting departments\
  \ that\ncan assist, on a fee-for-service basis, with some or all of the\nservices explicitly\
  \ excluded as above.\n\n6.2 Limitation\nTSI supports the Software Program as described in\
  \ the then-current\nprice book for which an annual TSIMS fee is paid. However, TSI will\n\
  fix errors in the current version and the immediately preceding\nversion of the Software Program.\
  \ The Licensee will provide TSI with\nall the necessary information on the application, the\
  \ platform, and\nthe infrastructure at the supported Site. If any of such information\nis\
  \ confidential, the Licensee should notify TSI in accordance with the\nconfidentiality provision\
  \ of the License Agreement.\n\n6.3 Levels of Support\n1st Level (or First Line Support) Support\
  \ includes filing the problem\nas an issue in TSI's database, querying the TSI database for\
  \ similar\nproblems, bugs, and resolutions on the topic and communicating a\nresolution or\
  \ plan for a resolution back to the Licensee.\n\n2nd Level Support includes further research\
  \ on the issue and includes,\nbut is not limited to: recreating the problem in house, receiving\
  \ and\nworking with pieces of Licensee's code that illustrate the behavior;\ndebugging Licensee's\
  \ code and working to resolve the issue. 2nd Level\nSupport issues are typically assigned\
  \ to a TSI Product Specialist.\n\n3rd Level Support includes but is not limited to the assistance\
  \ of\nProduct Support Specialists and Engineering Level Developers to assist\nin debugging\
  \ code, providing hints to solve the problem, working with\nTSI product code to determine\
  \ root causes.\n\nWhen the Licensee acquires TSI products through a TSI Partner, it is\nexpected\
  \ that the main support channel will be established through\nthat Partner. In that case, 1st\
  \ level support will be handled by that\nPartner, and TSI will communicate solely with the\
  \ Partner on\nLicensee's issues.\n\n6.4 Priority of an Issue\nThe Licensee and TSI customer\
  \ support staff shall jointly set issue\npriority levels.\n\nSEVERITY LEVEL 0 - CRISIS - An\
  \ emergency deployment or production\nenvironment situation where the Software Program is\
  \ inoperable or\nfails catastrophically and there is no workaround.\n\nSEVERITY LEVEL 1 -\
  \ HIGH - A detrimental situation where one of the\nfollowing conditions occurs:\n1.) performance\
  \ of the Software Program degrades substantially under\nreasonable loads causing a severe\
  \ impact on use; or 2.) one or more\nprimary functions or commands of the Software Program\
  \ is inoperable.\n\nSEVERITY LEVEL 2 - MEDIUM - Occurs when use of the Software Program is\n\
  noticeably affected but reasonably correctable by a workaround,\ndocumentation change, or\
  \ patch which may be completely resolved and\nintegrated into a future release.\n\nSEVERITY\
  \ LEVEL 3 - LOW - An inconvenient situation where the Software\nProgram is usable but does\
  \ not provide a function in the most\nconvenient manner and the Licensee suffers little or\
  \ no significant\nimpact.\n\n6.5 Licensee Assistance and Responsibility in Problem Resolution\n\
  When filing an issue, Licensee shall make the following information\navailable to TSI:\n-\
  \ Maintenance Support Agreement Number\n- Version (including revision level) of the TSI Software\
  \ Program\n  involved and any supporting product of software involved\n- Platform (Including\
  \ Operating System Revision Level) of the\n  Operating Environment\n- Error or other warning\
  \ or advisory messages which you have been\n  receiving\n- A reproducible test case where\
  \ applicable\n- Any trace, log, and/or console files\n- Configuration files\n- Severity Level\
  \ of problem\n- Priority Business or other justification for Severity Level 0\n  priority\
  \ issues\n- Licensee responsibility with regard to assisting in resolving the\n  Licensee\
  \ issue includes providing a Licensee on-site technical\n  contact, whose availability and\
  \ response should mirror the response\n  level requested of TSI, to provide resource and operational\n\
  \  assistance.\n\n6.6 Response/Resolution Time\nWithin the business hours of the Customer\
  \ Support Engineer responsible\nfor the issue:\nResponse Time: For the most prompt service,\
  \ relevant technical detail\nand quickest response time, (generally less than 1 day) issues\
  \ should\nbe reported via email at wrapper-support@tanukisoftware.com. Response\nto issues\
  \ reported to Customer Support through fax, or telephone may\nhave longer response times.\n\
  \nInitial Analysis/Resolution Time:\n\nCrisis Handled on a Case by Case Basis, but initial\
  \ response will be\nwithin 1 Business Day\n\nHigh Within 5 Business Days\n\nMedium Within\
  \ 10 Business Days\n\nLow Subject to Development and Customer Support Priority\n\nResolution\
  \ means that Customer Support will use its reasonable efforts\nto resolve Licensee issues\
  \ as prioritized above. Resolution may\ninclude: specification of a workaround; identification\
  \ of a bug; or\nthe recognition that additional analysis work needs to be done, on the\npart\
  \ of Customer Support and the Licensee, which will extend beyond\nthe initial resolution time.\n\
  In all cases, resolution of issues by Customer Support will require\nthe Licensee to assist\
  \ in the following: documentation and\nreproduction of the issue; provision of a Licensee\
  \ contact person with\nwhom TSI Customer Support can maintain contact to arrange for\nanalysis,\
  \ testing, systems, and other resources and other tasks in\nsupport of resolution of the Licensee's\
  \ problem and to whom status\nreports and requests for resources can be addressed.\nOngoing\
  \ communication shall be maintained regarding Licensee issue\nstatus and progress towards\
  \ resolution between TSI Customer Support\nand the Licensee's issue contact.\n\n6.7 Notification\n\
  The Licensee will, by default, be notified by e-mail of all relevant\nupdates on the issue\
  \ since appropriate levels of technical detail are\noften best captured and presented via\
  \ written e-mail.\nTSI's Support staff can also maintain telephone contact with the\nLicensee,\
  \ if requested.\n\n6.8 Distribution of Updates\nShipment of Updates and New Versions will\
  \ be made on a request-only\nbasis. Requests can be made through an e-mail message.\n\n6.9\
  \ Licensee Issues Are Typically Handled by Customer Support\nEngineers\nThis is the primary\
  \ and usual scenario. Contact is maintained between\nthe Licensee and the TSI Customer Support\
  \ Engineer (\"CSE\") responsible\nfor the issue. The e-mail address to be used is: \nwrapper-support@tanukisoftware.com"
