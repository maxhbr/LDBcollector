  "text": "ANTLR SOFTWARE RIGHTS\n\nANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr\nPartially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com\n\nWe reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR --it is fully in the public domain. An\nindividual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed\nwith ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR,\nor its output, into commerical software.\n\nWe encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that\ncredit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By \"credit\", we mean that if you use\nANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial\nproduct, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact\nsomewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and\nhave developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it\nusing ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source\ncode. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\nsystem and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.\n\nThe primary ANTLR guy:\n\nTerence Parr\nparrt@cs.usfca.edu\nparrt@antlr.org"
