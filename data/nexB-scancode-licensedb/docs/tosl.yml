notes: |
  Per Fedora, the Trusster Open Source License (TOSL) is a derivation of the
  Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where the
  Sleepycat License says The source code must either be included in the
  distribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus
  a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
  conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source code must either be
  included in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no
  more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely
  redistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While
  the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license,
  TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the "no more
  restrictive" language.
