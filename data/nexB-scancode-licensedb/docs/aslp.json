AUTOSAR Released Materials can be based on subsets of the AUTOSAR Development Materials.\n\nd) Third Party Intellectual Property Rights\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.

As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\nFor example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\ne) Contributor Represents Sufficient Rights\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the licenses set forth in this License.\n\n3.
