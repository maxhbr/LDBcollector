The exception can\nonly be used if you wish to combine FreeRTOS with a proprietary product and\nyou comply with the terms stated in the exception itself.\nThe FreeRTOS download also includes demo application source code, some of\nwhich is provided by third parties AND IS LICENSED SEPARATELY FROM\nFREERTOS.\nFor the avoidance of any doubt refer to the comment included at the top of\neach source and header file for license and copyright information.\nThis is a list of files for which Real Time Engineers Ltd. is not the\ncopyright owner and are NOT COVERED BY THE GPL.\n1. Various header files provided by silicon manufacturers and tool vendors\nthat define processor specific memory addresses and utility macros.\nPermission has been granted by the various copyright holders for these\nfiles to be included in the FreeRTOS download. Users must ensure license\nconditions are adhered to for any use other than compilation of the\nFreeRTOS demo applications.\n2.
