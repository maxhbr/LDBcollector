  "notes": "Per Fedora, this is an Apache 1.1 derived license. Unfortunately, clause 4\nis too broad, making it Free but GPL-incompatible. It does also replace the\ndeprecated keys classworlds and apache-due-credit that were the same licenses.\nPlexus Classworlds was started in 2002 and dom4j in 2000/2001 hence it has precedence.\nOther projects such as Exolab/Intalio/Castor and JCharts have used the same license.\nCastor is actually the first to use this but dom4j is still commonly used and castor less so.\n",
