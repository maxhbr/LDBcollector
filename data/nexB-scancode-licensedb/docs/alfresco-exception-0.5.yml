text: "Alfresco Software, Ltd. FLOSS License Exception\n\n The Alfresco Software, Ltd. Exception\
  \ for Free/Libre and Open Source Software-only Applications Using Alfresco software (the `FLOSS\
  \ Exception').\n\nVersion 0.5, 30 August 2006\nException Intent\n\nWe want specified Free/Libre\
  \ and Open Source Software (\"FLOSS\") applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed\
  \ Alfresco software (the \"Program\") despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible\
  \ with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the \"GPL\").\nLegal Terms and Conditions\n\
  \nAs a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the GPL:\n\nYou are\
  \ free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Program and one or\
  \ more works (each, a \"FLOSS Work\") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below\
  \ in section 1, as long as:\n\n    You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the\
  \ Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived\
  \ from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works\
  \ in themselves,\n    all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived\
  \ from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works\
  \ in themselves,\n        are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below,\
  \ and\n        the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the\
  \ complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same medium\
  \ and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of\
  \ those sections, and\n    any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative\
  \ Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably\
  \ be considered independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of\
  \ either the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.\n\nIf the above conditions are not\
  \ met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms\
  \ and conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from Alfresco Software, Ltd.\n\

  2. Definitions\n\n    Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided\
  \ in the GPL.\n    Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.\n\n3. Applicability\n\
  \nThis FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed by Alfresco Software,\
  \ Ltd. saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception.\
  \ If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program and any\
  \ other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work;\
  \ thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL\
  \ in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to redistribute\
  \ a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception\
  \ notice from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by\
  \ you or any third party.\nAppendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages\n\nThe following is\
  \ a a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages which are covered by the FLOSS License\
  \ Exception. Please note that appendix is merely provided as an additional service to specific\
  \ FLOSS projects who wish to simplify licensing information for their users. Compliance with\
  \ one of the licenses noted under the \"FLOSS license list\" section remains a prerequisite.\n\
