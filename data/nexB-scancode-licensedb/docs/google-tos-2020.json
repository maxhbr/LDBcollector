As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\n\n    What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\n    What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\n    Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services \u2014 whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\n    In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\n\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.\n\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nService provider\n\nIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:\n\nGoogle Ireland Limited\nincorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland (Registered Number: 368047)\n\nGordon House, Barrow Street\nDublin 4\nIreland\nAge requirements\n\nIf you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.\n\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nContents\nIntroduction\nYour relationship with Google\nUsing Google services\nContent in Google services\nSoftware in Google services\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nAbout these terms\nYour relationship with Google\n\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google\u2019s business works and how we earn money. When we speak of \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\nWe provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:\n\n    apps and sites (like Search and Maps)\n    platforms (like Google Play)\n    integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies\u2019 apps or sites)\n    devices (like Google Home)\n\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.\nImprove Google services\n\nWe\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.\n\nWe maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.\n\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\nThe permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:\n\n    these terms\n    service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\n\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.\n\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\nMany of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:\n\n    comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws\n    respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights\n    don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2014 for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others\n    don\u2019t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services\n\nOur service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nPermission to use your content\n\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\n\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.\n\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat\u2019s covered\n\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat\u2019s not covered\n\n    This license doesn\u2019t affect your data protection rights \u2014 it\u2019s only about your intellectual property rights\n    This license doesn\u2019t cover these types of content:\n        publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn\u2019t require a license because it\u2019s considered common knowledge that everyone\u2019s free to use.\n        feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\n\nScope\nThis license is:\n\n    worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n    non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\n    royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license\n\nRights\n\nThis license allows Google to:\n\n    host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content \u2014 for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\n    publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you\u2019ve made it visible to others\n    modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it\n    sublicense these rights to:\n        other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\n        our contractors who\u2019ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\n\nPurpose\n\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\n\n    operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\n        for spam, malware, and illegal content\n        to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\n        to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\n    This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\n    using content you\u2019ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.\n    developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms\n\nDuration\n\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\n\nIf you remove from our services any content that\u2019s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\n\n    If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend\u2019s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.\n    If you make your content available through other companies\u2019 services, it\u2019s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.\n\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\n\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work \u2014 for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\nMany organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:\n\n    an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\n    your organization\u2019s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\n\nIf you\u2019re based in the European Union, then these terms don\u2019t affect the rights you may have as a business user of online intermediation services \u2014 including online platforms such as Google Play \u2014 under the EU Platform-to-Business Regulation.\nService-related communications\n\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\n\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available \u2014 for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\n\n    See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services\n    See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services\n\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we\u2019ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\n\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google \u2014 for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google\u2019s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\n\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations \u2014 for example, a store owner\u2019s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization\u2019s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations\u2019 content are theirs, and don\u2019t necessarily reflect Google\u2019s views.\nSoftware in Google services\n\nSome of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\nThe license we give you is:\n\n    worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n    non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\n    royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license\n    personal, which means it doesn\u2019t extend to anyone else\n    non-assignable, which means you\u2019re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\n\nSome of our services include software that\u2019s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.\n\nWhen a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\nIn case of problems or disagreements\n\nBy law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don\u2019t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you\u2019re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.\nWarranty\n\nWe provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don\u2019t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we\u2019ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.\nDisclaimers\n\nThe only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don\u2019t make any other commitments about our services.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\n\nThese terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don\u2019t limit Google\u2019s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.\n\nOther than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or disagreements), Google won\u2019t be responsible for any other losses, unless they\u2019re caused by our breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.\nFor business users and organizations only\n\nIf you\u2019re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:\n\n    You\u2019ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.\n    Google won\u2019t be responsible for the following liabilities:\n        loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\n        indirect or consequential loss\n        punitive damages\n    Google\u2019s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) \u20ac500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach\n\nIf you\u2019re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.\nTaking action in case of problems\n\nBefore taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\n\n    cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\n    violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order\n    compromise an investigation\n    compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\n\nRemoving your content\n\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\n\nGoogle reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\n\n    you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\n    we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\n    we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\n\nIf you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\n\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nHandling requests for your data\n\nRespect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google\u2019s data disclosure policies. Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\n\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\n\nIf you\u2019re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts.\n\nIf you\u2019re a consumer living in the EEA, you may also file disputes regarding online purchases using the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution platform, which we accept if required by law.\nAbout these terms\n\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\n\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\n\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\n\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\n\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\n\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account."
