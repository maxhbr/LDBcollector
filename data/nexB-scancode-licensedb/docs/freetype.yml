text: "The FreeType Project LICENSE\n----------------------------\n2006-Jan-27\n\nCopyright\
  \ 1996-2002, 2006 by\nDavid Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\
  \n  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n  some of them may\
  \ contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n  various tools and  contributions which\
  \ rely on, or  relate to, the\n  FreeType Project.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files\
  \ found  in such  packages, and\n  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license. \
  \ The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation\
  \ and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,\
  \  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and \
  \ use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence,\
  \ its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we\
  \ will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You\
  \ can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having\
  \ to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.\
  \  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n    \
  \  somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\
  \n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with \
  \ or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering\
  \  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\
  \  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer\
  \ to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n  encourage you to use the following text:\n\
  \n   \"\"\"  \n    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType\n    Project\
  \ (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\n   \"\"\"\n\n  Please replace <year> with the\
  \ value from the FreeType version you\n  actually use.\n\n\nLegal Terms\n===========\n\n0.\
  \ Definitions\n--------------\n\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType\
  \ Project',\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\n  distributed\
  \  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType\
  \ Project', be they named as alpha,\n  beta or final release.\n\n  `You' refers to  the licensee,\
  \ or person using  the project, where\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the\
  \ project's source\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\n\
  \  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\n  engine'.\n\n  This\
  \  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\n  FreeType  Project,   including\
  \  all  source   code,  binaries  and\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the\
  \  file  in  its\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\n \
  \ If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\n  this license, you\
  \ must contact us to verify this.\n\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by\
  \ David Turner,\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\n  specified\
  \ below.\n\n1. No Warranty\n--------------\n\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS'\
  \ WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED\
  \ TO,\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\n  PURPOSE.  IN\
  \ NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED\
  \  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\n\n2. Redistribution\n\
  -----------------\n\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\n\
  \  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\n  display,  copy, \
  \  create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in\
  \  both source and  object code\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose;\
  \ and  to\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\n  herein,\
  \ subject to the following conditions:\n\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain\
  \ this  license file\n      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\n\
  \      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\n      documentation.\
  \   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\n      original  files must  be  preserved\
  \ in  all  copies of  source\n      files.\n\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide\
  \ a  disclaimer  that\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\n\
  \      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\n      encourage you\
  \ to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\n      documentation, though this isn't\
  \ mandatory.\n\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\n  the\
  \ FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\n  our work, you  must acknowledge\
  \ us.  However, no  fee need be paid\n  to us.\n\n3. Advertising\n--------------\n\n  Neither\
  \ the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\n  the name of the  other for\
  \ commercial, advertising, or promotional\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\n\
  \n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\n  following phrases\
  \ to refer  to this software in your documentation\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType\
  \ Project',  `FreeType Engine',\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n\n  As\
  \  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\n  accept  it.   However,\
  \  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n  material, only  this license, or  another\
  \ one contracted  with the\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify\
  \ it.\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n  Project, you\
  \ indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n  of this license.\n\n4. Contacts\n\
  -----------\n\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\n\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\n\
  \n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\n      future and \
  \ wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\n      If  you are looking  for support,\
  \  start in  this list  if you\n      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\n\
  \n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\n\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,\
  \  design issues,\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\n\n  Our home page can be found\
  \ at\n\n    http://www.freetype.org\n\n--- end of FTL.TXT ---"
