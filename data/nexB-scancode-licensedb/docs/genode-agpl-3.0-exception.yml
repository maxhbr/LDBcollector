  \ is licensed under the terms of the\n  GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3).\n\
  \ \n  Linking Genode code statically or dynamically with other modules\n  is making a combined\
  \ work based on Genode. Thus, the terms and\n  conditions of the AGPLv3 cover the whole combination.\n\
  \ \n  As an \"additional permission\" as defined by Section 7 of the\n  AGPLv3, Genode Labs\
  \ as the copyright holder of Genode gives you\n  permission to link Genode source code with\
  \ \"independent modules\"\n  to produce an executable if the independent modules are licensed\n\
  \  under an \"approved license\", and to copy and distribute the\n  resulting executable under\
  \ terms of your choice, provided that you\n  also meet, for each linked independent module,\
  \ the terms and\n  conditions of the license of that module.\n \n  An \"approved license\"\
  \ is a license that is officially approved as\n  an Open-Source license by the Open Source\
  \ Initiative [1], or\n  listed as a Free-Software license by the Free Software Foundation\n\
  \  [2], or explicitly approved by Genode Labs.\n \n  An \"independent module\" is a module\
  \ which is not derived from or\n  based on Genode, or merely uses the Genode API as defined\
  \ in the\n  official documentation.\n \n  If you modify Genode, you may extend this exception\
  \ to your\n  version of Genode, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not\n  wish to\
  \ do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n \n  [1] https://opensource.org/licenses\n\
