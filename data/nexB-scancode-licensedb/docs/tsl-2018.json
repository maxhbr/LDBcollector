BY INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU\nHAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL\nAGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT\nINSTALL OR USE SUCH SOFTWARE.  IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE ON\nBEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY\nTO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT\nLEGAL ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO BIND THAT LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS TSL AGREEMENT.\n\nThis TSL Agreement is entered into by and between Timescale, Inc. (\"Timescale\")\nand you or the legal entity on whose behalf you are accepting this TSL\nAgreement (\"You\").\n\n0. BACKGROUND\n\n   The Timescale time-series database software and related software is offered\n   as \"open code\" or \"source-available\" code.  This means that all source code\n   of the software is available for inspection and download at\n   https://github.com/timescale.  The Timescale software is composed of two\n   major pieces.\n\n   The first, core piece (referred to herein as the Timescale Open Source\n   Software, as defined below) is open source software that is licensed under\n   the Apache Version 2.0 license.\n\n   The second piece (referred to herein as the TSL Licensed Software, as\n   defined below) is all of the Timescale Software other than the Timescale\n   Open Source Software.\n\n   Certain functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred to\n   herein as Community Features, as defined below) may be used under this TSL\n   Agreement without charge, in some cases subject to certain usage limits that\n   may be imposed by a software license key and/or technical restrictions in\n   the code.\n\n   Certain other functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred\n   to herein as Enterprise Features, as defined below) may be used either\n   solely under a Commercial License Agreement subject to charge, or under this\n   TSL Agreement without charge only for a limited time trial period.  In order\n   to use such features, You must obtain an appropriate license key.\n\n   You may find more information at https://www.timescale.com/pricing about\n   which functions and features of the TSL Licensed Software are classified as\n   Community Features and Enterprise Features, details about any applicable\n   usage limits and trial periods, and a description of how You can obtain any\n   required license keys and enter into a Commercial License Agreement with\n   Timescale.\n\n1. GOVERNING LICENSES\n\n   1.1 Source Code.  The source code for all Timescale Software is made\n   publicly available by Timescale at https://github.com/timescale.  However,\n   different license agreements govern the use of different parts of the\n   Timescale Software source code.  The use of Timescale Open Source Software,\n   in both source and executable forms, is governed by the terms of the Apache\n   License Version 2.0, a copy of which is available at\n   https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.  The use of all other Timescale\n   Software in source code form is governed by this TSL Agreement and/or a\n   Commercial License Agreement, as applicable.\n\n   1.2 Commercial License Rights.  If You desire to use Community Features\n   beyond applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features beyond an\n   applicable trial period (or those Enterprise Features that are not available\n   for use under this TSL Agreement at all), as the case may be, You must\n   obtain an appropriate License Key and enter into a Commercial License\n   Agreement with Timescale, subject to applicable charges.\n\n   1.3 License Rights to Your Customers.  As set forth in Section 2.1 below,\n   the use by Your customers of the Timescale Software as part of any Value\n   Added Products or Services that You distribute will be subject to the most\n   current version of this TSL Agreement, including any applicable Usage Limits\n   and restrictions on the use of Enterprise Features.  If Your customers\n   desire to use any functions or features of the Timescale Software beyond\n   applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features, they must enter into\n   a Commercial License Agreement with Timescale and obtain any necessary\n   License Keys.\n\n2.

GENERAL\n\n   8.1 Complete Agreement.

This TSL Agreement may be modified by Timescale from time\n   to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the \"Posted Date\"\n   set forth at the top of the modified agreement. The modified agreement shall\n   govern any new version of the TSL Licensed Software (and all its constituent\n   source code and binaries) that is officially released as a complete version\n   release by Timescale on or after such Posted Date. Except as set forth in\n   this Section 8.2, this TSL Agreement may not be amended except by a writing\n   executed by both parties.\n\n   8.3 Governing Law.  This TSL Agreement shall be governed by and construed\n   solely under the laws of the State of New York, without application of any\n   choice of law rules or principles that would lead to the applicability of\n   the law of any other jurisdiction.

You acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach\n   of any provision of this TSL Agreement will cause irreparable harm to\n   Timescale for which damages at law will not provide adequate relief, and\n   Timescale shall therefore be entitled to injunctive relief against such\n   breach or threatened breach without being required to post a bond.\n\n   8.6 Assignment.  You may not assign this TSL Agreement, including by\n   operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition or otherwise, in\n   whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Timescale, which\n   Timescale may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.  Any\n   assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void.\n\n   8.7 Independent Contractors.  The parties to this TSL Agreement are\n   independent contractors and this TSL Agreement does not establish any\n   relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency\n   between the parties.\n\n   8.8 U.S. Government Rights.
