  \ AdColony. AdColony may terminate this Agreement at any\n        time by providing sixty\
  \ (60) days’ notice to Developer. Additionally,\n        AdColony may terminate this Agreement\
  \ immediately if Developer breaches\n        any provision of this Agreement.\n\n        3.\
  \ Termination by Developer. Developer may terminate this Agreement at\n        any time by\
  \ providing written notice to AdColony (email to suffice),\n        ceasing all use of the\
  \ AdColony Platform and AdColony Property, and\n        destroying or removing from all hard\
  \ drives, networks, and other storage\n        media all copies of the AdColony Property.\n\
  \n        4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement by\n        Developer,\
  \ the Agreement (including all rights and licenses granted and\n        obligations assumed\
  \ hereunder) will remain in force and effect until the\n        completion of all AdColony\
  \ Ad campaigns associated with the Developer\n        Apps in effect on the date of such termination\
  \ (“Sell-Off Period”).\n        AdColony’s payment obligations will remain in effect during\
  \ the Sell-Off\n        Period. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party will promptly\n\
  \        return or destroy all copies of any Confidential Information in its\n        possession\
  \ or control. Sections 3, 7(D) through 13 shall survive any\n        expiration or termination\
  \ of this Agreement.\n\n    8. Confidentiality\n\n        A. Definition. “Confidential Information”\
  \ means any and all business,\n        technical and financial information or material of\
  \ a party, whether\n        revealed orally, visually, or in tangible or electronic form,\
  \ that is\n        not generally known to the public, which is disclosed to or made\n    \
  \    available by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other, or which\n        one party\
  \ becomes aware of pursuant to this Agreement (the “Receiving\n        Party”). The AdColony\
  \ SDK is AdColony’s Confidential Information, and\n        the terms and conditions of this\
  \ Agreement shall remain confidential.\n        The failure of a Disclosing Party to designate\
  \ as “confidential” any\n        such information or material at the time of disclosure shall\
  \ not result\n        in a loss of status as Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.\n\
  \        Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) is in\n       \
  \ or has entered the public domain through no breach of this Agreement or\n        other act\
  \ by a Receiving Party; (ii) a Receiving Party rightfully knew\n        prior to the time\
  \ that it was disclosed to a Receiving Party hereunder;\n        (iii) a Receiving Party received\
  \ without restriction from a third-party\n        lawfully possessing and lawfully entitled\
  \ to disclose such information\n        without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) was independently\
  \ developed by\n        employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\n\
  \n        B. Use and Disclosure Restrictions. The Receiving Party shall not use\n        the\
  \ Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise its rights\n        or perform\
  \ its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose\n        the Confidential Information\
  \ to any third party, except to those of its\n        employees, subcontractors, and advisers\
  \ that need to know such\n        Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement,\
  \ provided\n        that each such employee, subcontractor, and advisor is subject to a\n\
  \        written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions\n       \
  \ that are at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those\n        set forth\
  \ herein. The Receiving Party will use at least the efforts such\n        party ordinarily\
  \ uses with respect to its own confidential information\n        of similar nature and importance\
  \ to maintain the confidentiality of all\n        Confidential Information in its possession\
  \ or control, but in no event\n        less than reasonable efforts. The foregoing obligations\
  \ will not\n        restrict the Receiving Party from disclosing any Confidential\n      \
  \  Information required by applicable law; provided that, the Receiving\n        Party must\
  \ use reasonable efforts to give the Disclosing Party advance\n        notice thereof (i.e.,\
  \ so as to afford Disclosing Party an opportunity to\n        intervene and seek an order\
  \ or other relief for protecting its\n        Confidential Information from any unauthorized\
  \ use or disclosure) and\n        the Confidential Information is only disclosed to the extent\
  \ required by\n        law. The Receiving Party shall return all of the Disclosing Party’s\n\
  \        Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy the same, no\n      \
  \  later than fifteen (15) days after Disclosing Party’s request, or when\n        Receiving\
  \ Party no longer needs Confidential Information for its\n        authorized purposes hereunder.\n\
  \n    9. Representations and Warranties of Developer. Developer represents,\n    warrants\
  \ and covenants to AdColony that: (a) it has all necessary rights,\n    title, and interest\
  \ in and to the Developer Apps, and it has obtained all\n    necessary rights, releases, and\
  \ permissions to grant the rights granted to\n    AdColony in this Agreement, including to\
  \ allow AdColony to sell and insert\n    the AdColony Ads as contemplated herein; (b) it shall\
  \ not use the AdColony\n    Platform to collect or discern any personally identifiable information\
  \ of\n    end users, or use the data received through the AdColony Platform to re-\n    identify\
  \ an individual; and (c) the Developer Apps will comply with the\n    Developer Apps Content\
  \ Policy, and will not infringe upon, violate, or\n    misappropriate any third party right,\
  \ including any intellectual property,\n    privacy, or publicity rights.\n\n    10. Warranty\
  \ Disclaimer. THE ADCOLONY SDK AND ADCOLONY PLATFORM ARE PROVIDED\n    “AS IS”. ADCOLONY DOES\
  \ NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY\n    OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT\

  \  11. Indemnification.\n\n        1. Developer Indemnification. Developer agrees to indemnify,\
  \ defend, and\n        hold harmless AdColony and its affiliates, and their directors,\n \

  \ with any breach of Developer’s\n        obligations, representations or warranties set forth\
  \ in this Agreement;\n        provided that, AdColony: (a) promptly notifies Developer in\
  \ writing of\n        the claim, except that any failure to provide this notice promptly only\n\
  \        relieves Developer of its responsibility to the extent its defense is\n        materially\
  \ prejudiced by the delay; (b) grants Developer sole control of\n        the defense and/or\
  \ settlement of the claim; and (c) reasonably\n        cooperates with Developer in connection\

  \ AdColony agrees to indemnify, reimburse and\n        hold harmless, Developer, its officers,\
  \ directors, employees, and agents\n        from and against any and all third party claims,\

  \ party U.S. copyright, trademark or trade secret by the use of the\n        AdColony Platform\
  \ and/or the AdColony SDK by Developer as permitted\n        hereunder; provided that, Developer:\
  \ (a) promptly notifies AdColony in\n        writing of the claim, except that any failure\
  \ to provide this notice\n        promptly only relieves AdColony of its responsibility to\
  \ the extent its\n        defense is materially prejudiced by the delay; (b) grants AdColony\
  \ sole\n        control of the defense and/or settlement of the claim; and (c)\n        reasonably\
  \ cooperates with AdColony in connection with such claim at\n        AdColony’s cost and expense.\
  \ In addition, if the use of the AdColony\n        Property by Developer has become, or in\
  \ AdColony’s opinion is likely to\n        become, the subject of any claim of infringement,\
  \ AdColony may at its\n        option and expense (i) procure for Developer the right to continue\
  \ using\n        the AdColony Property as set forth hereunder; (ii) replace or modify the\n\
  \        AdColony Property to make it non- infringing so long as the AdColony\n        Property\
  \ has substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if options\n        (i) or (ii) are\
  \ not reasonably practicable, terminate this Agreement.\n        AdColony shall have no liability\
  \ or obligation under this Section with\n        respect to any claim if such claim is caused\
  \ in whole or in part by (x)\n        compliance with designs, data, instructions, or specifications\
  \ provided\n        by Developer; (y) modification of the AdColony Property by any party\n\
  \        other than AdColony without AdColony’s express consent; or (z) the\n        combination,\
  \ operation, or use of the AdColony Property with other\n        applications, portions of\
  \ applications, product(s), data or services\n        where the AdColony Property would not\
  \ by itself be infringing unless\n        AdColony has required or expressly allowed such\
  \ combination, operation,\n        or use. THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION\
  \ 11 ARE\n        DEVELOPER’S SOLE REMEDY FOR THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATING TO\n\
  \        ADCOLONY’S SDK AND THE ADCOLONY PLATFORM.\n\n    12. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT\

  \ SPECIAL,\n    RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST BUSINESS, DATA, REVENUE,\n\
  \    OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING\n    NEGLIGENCE),\
  \ OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE\n    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS\
  \ OR DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION\n    OBLIGATIONS HEREIN AND BREACHES\
  \ OF SECTIONS 2 and 8, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER\n    PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS\
  \ AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL DEVELOPER\n    PAYMENT PAYABLE TO DEVELOPER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT\
  \ BY ADCOLONY IN THE TWELVE\n    (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM.\n\
  \n    13. General.\n\n        1. Relationship of the Parties. Each Party shall be and act\
  \ as an\n        independent contractor and not as partner, joint venturer, or agent of\n\
  \        the other. No party shall have any right to obligate or bind any other\n        party.\n\
  \n        2. Assignment. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations\n     \
  \   under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other\n        party, except\
  \ in connection with any merger (by operation of law or\n        otherwise), consolidation,\
  \ reorganization, change in control or sale of\n        all or substantially all of its assets\
  \ related to this Agreement or\n        similar transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\
  \ Developer may not\n        assign this Agreement to a direct competitor of AdColony without\n\
  \        AdColony’s prior written consent. This Agreement inures to the benefit\n        of\

  \  made to this Agreement unless evidenced in writing and signed for and on\n        behalf\
  \ of both parties. The failure by either party to insist upon the\n        strict performance\
  \ of this Agreement, or to exercise any term hereof,\n        will not act as a waiver of\
  \ any right, promise or term, which will\n        continue in full force and effect.\n\n \
  \       4. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and\n       \
  \ construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California,\n        without reference\
  \ to conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree\n        that the federal and state courts\
  \ in Los Angeles County, California will\n        have exclusive jurisdiction and venue under\
  \ this Agreement, and the\n        parties hereby agree to submit to such jurisdiction exclusively.\n\
  \n        5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of\n     \
  \   the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all other\n        agreements\
  \ and understandings, whether oral or written."
