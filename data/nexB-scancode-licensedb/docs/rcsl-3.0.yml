  \ 3.0 (Rev. Date:  May 29, 2007)\n \nRECITALS\n \nRealNetworks, Inc. (\"RN\") has developed\
  \ Specifications, Source Code implementations and Executables of the Helix DNA Code, and an\
  \ associated TCK; and\n \nRN desires to license the Helix DNA Code to a large community to\
  \ facilitate research, innovation and product development while maintaining compatibility\
  \ of such products with the Helix DNA Code as delivered by RN;\n \nTherefore, RN makes available\
  \ the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, and the TCK available for Research and Development\
  \ Use only under the following terms: \n \nLICENSE\n \n1.  Introduction. \n \nThe RealNetworks\
  \ Community Source License – Research and Development Use (\"RCSL R&D\" or \"License\") is\
  \ a license to use the Source Code of certain portions of the Helix DNA Code, Specifications,\
  \ and the TCK for research and development use only.   You (\"Licensee,\" as more specifically\
  \ defined below) accept the terms of this License by downloading or using the Helix DNA Code,\
  \ the Specifications, or the TCK, unless Licensee and RN have signed a license agreement that\
  \ expressly supersedes this RCSL R&D. \n \nThis License does not include a license to access\
  \ or modify the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires the right\
  \ to receive access to the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code for the purposes of\
  \ porting and optimization, Licensee and RN may elect to execute a Real Format Source Code\
  \ Porting and Optimization Agreement.\n \nThis License does not include a license to make\
  \ Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires a\
  \ license for Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code, Licensee and\
  \ RN may desire to execute the RealNetworks Community Source License - Commercial Use (\"\
  RCSL Commercial\") for the version of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code of which\
  \ Licensee would like to make Commercial Use.  Once executed by Licensee and RN, the RCSL\
  \ Commercial would supersede the terms of this License.\n \nCapitalized terms used in this\
  \ License are defined in the Glossary attached to the end of this License.\n \n 2.  License\
  \ Grants.\n \n 2.1  RN Grant to use Covered Code, Specifications, and TCK. \n \nSubject to\
  \ Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this License, RN grants to Licensee a worldwide,\
  \ royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of RN's Intellectual Property Rights\
  \ covering the Covered Code, Specifications, and the TCK to do the following:\n \n(a) Research\
  \ Use License.\n \n(i) use, reproduce and modify the Covered Code and Specifications to create\

  \ Restrictions.  \n \n                        Licensee may not create derivative works of\
  \ the TCK or use the TCK to test any implementation of the Specifications except for the purpose\
  \ of creating Compliant Covered Code.  Licensee may not publish Licensee’s test results or\
  \ make claims of comparative compatibility with respect to other implementations of the Specification.\
  \ \n \n2.2 Licensee’s Grants.\n \n(a) To Other Helix Licensees.  Licensee hereby grants to\
  \ each other Helix Licensee a license to Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications,\
  \ of the same scope and extent as RN's licenses under Section 2.1 (a) above relative to Research\
  \ Use.\n \n(b) To RN.  Licensee hereby grant to RN a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\
  \ perpetual and irrevocable license, to the extent of Licensee’s Intellectual Property Rights\
  \ covering Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications,\
  \ to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications\
  \ and Reformatted Specifications, in any form, including the right to sublicense such rights\
  \ through multiple tiers of distribution.\n \n(c) Other than the licenses expressly granted\
  \ in Sections 2.2(a) and (b) above, and the restrictions set forth in Section 3.1 below, Licensee\
  \ retains all right, title, and interest in Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications\
  \ and Reformatted Specifications.\n \n2.3 Modifications by Helix Licensees. \n \nLicensee\
  \ may use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Error Corrections, Shared Modifications\
  \ and Reformatted Specifications, obtained by Licensee under this License from any other Helix\
  \ Licensee, to the same scope and extent as with Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications.\n\
  \ \n2.4 Subcontracting. \n \n                        Licensee may deliver the Source Code\
  \ of Covered Code to other Helix Licensees for the sole purpose of furnishing development\
  \ services to Licensee in connection with Licensee’s rights granted in this License, provided\
  \ that Licensee does not enter a separate agreement with such Licensee that contains provisions\
  \ inconsistent with the ownership and licensing requirements set forth in this License. \n\
  \ \n3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.\n \n3.1 Research Use License. \n \nAs a condition\
  \ of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, Licensee must comply with the\
  \ following:\n \n(a) Licensee’s Contributions.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications\
  \ which Licensee creates are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2\
  \ above.  Licensee is encouraged to license all of Licensee’s other Modifications under Section\
  \ 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but is not required to do so.  Licensee must notify RN of any\
  \ errors in the Specifications.\n \n(b) Source Code Availability.  Licensee must provide all\
  \ of Licensee’s Error Corrections to RN as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event,\
  \ no later than when Licensee shares such Error Corrections with any other Helix Licensee.\
  \  RN may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared\
  \ Modifications at the Helix Community Website.  \n \n(c) Notices.  All Error Corrections\
  \ and Shared Modifications that Licensee creates or contributes to must include a file documenting\
  \ the additions and changes Licensee made and the date of such additions and changes.  Licensee\
  \ must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header of any Error\
  \ Correction or Shared Modification.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular\
  \ Source Code file due to its structure, then Licensee must include the notice in a location\
  \ (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for\
  \ such a notice.\n \n(d) Redistribution.\n \n(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed\
  \ in Source Code form only to another Helix Licensee (except for students as provided below).\
  \  Licensee may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements,\
  \ or responsibilities of such Helix Licensee.  Licensee may distribute Covered Code to students\
  \ for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited\
  \ educational institutions.  Such students need not be Helix Licensees, but must be given\
  \ a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in\
  \ a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\n\
  \ \n(ii) Executable.  Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix\
  \ Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection\
  \ with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee’s choice, but that limits\
  \ use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\n \n(iii) Modified\
  \ Class, Interface and Package Naming.  In connection with Research Use by Licensee only,\
  \ Licensee may use RN's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or\
  \ invoke the Source Code files that Licensee modifies.  RN grants to Licensee a limited license\
  \ to the extent necessary for such purposes. \n \n(e) Extensions. \n \n(i) Licensee may not\
  \ include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions.  Licensee may include the compiled\
  \ Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Licensee’s use of the Covered\
  \ Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.\
  \  \n \n(ii) Open.  Licensee must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights\
  \ Licensee may have covering any Interface(s) of Licensee’s Extension, which would prevent\
  \ the implementation of such Interface(s) by RN or any Helix Licensee.  This obligation does\
  \ not prevent Licensee from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right Licensee has that would\
  \ otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Licensee’s Extension.\n \n(iii) Interface\
  \ Modifications and Naming.  Licensee may not modify or add to the GUID space   \"xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59\"\
  \ or any other GUID space designated by RN.  Licensee may not modify any Interface prefix\
  \ provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix designated by RN. \n \n(f) Any Specifications\
  \ provided to Licensee by RN are confidential and proprietary information of RN.  Licensee\
  \ must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications and may not disclose them to any\
  \ third party without RN’s prior written consent.  Licensee may only use the Specifications\
  \ under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing the terms of this\
  \ License with respect to Community Code.  Licensee may not use, copy or distribute any such\
  \ Specifications except as provided in writing by RN.\n \nNo Commercial Use. \n \nLicensee\
  \ may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless Licensee and RN have executed a copy\
  \ of the RCSL - Commercial available at the Helix Community Website, or another license agreement\
  \ expressly granting commercial use rights.  \n \n4.  Versions of the License.\n \n4.1 License\
  \ Versions.\n \nRN may publish revised versions of this License from time to time.  Each version\
  \ will be given a distinguishing version number.  No one other than RN has the right to promulgate\
  \ versions of this License.\n \n4.2 Effect of New License Versions.\n \n(a) Once a particular\
  \ version of Covered Code has been provided under a version of this License, Licensee may\
  \ always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.\
  \  Licensee may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version\
  \ of the License, but not under a prior version of the License.  (For example, if a version\
  \ of Covered Code has been provided under RCSL R&D 2.1, Licensee may not use such Covered\
  \ Code under RCSL R&D 2.0.) \n \n(b) Version 3.0 of this License (and all subsequent versions)\
  \ supercedes versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0 of RCSL R&D plus Attachments A-C.\n \n4.3 Multiple-Licensed\
  \ Code.\n \nRN may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed.\"  \"Multiple-Licensed\"\
  \ means that the RN permits Licensee to utilize those designated portions of the Covered Code\
  \ under Licensee’s choice of this License or the alternative license(s), if any, specified\
  \ by the RN at the Helix Community Website or in Header Files for the applicable Covered Code.\
