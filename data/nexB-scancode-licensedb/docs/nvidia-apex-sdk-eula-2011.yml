text: "NVIDIA CORPORATION\nNVIDIA APEX SDK END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT\nWelcome to the new world\
  \ of game development physical asset creation provided to you\nwith the APEX SDK from NVIDIA®.\n\
  \nNVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) is willing to license the APEX SDK and the\naccompanying documentation,\
  \ samples applications, utilities, and asset authoring\nlibraries to you only on the condition\
  \ that you accept all the terms in this License\nAgreement (“Agreement”).\n\nIMPORTANT: READ\
  \ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE\nUSING THE ACCOMPANYING NVIDIA APEX SDK.\nIF YOU\
