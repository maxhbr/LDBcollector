Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon\nApple's posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that\nis used for implementation of this License.  Upon such final\ndetermination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the\npayment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction,\nmodification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original\nCode, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected\nOriginal Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site\nthat is used for implementation of this License.  If Apple suspends\nYour rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall\nbe construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable\nlaw, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing\ncode or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third\nparty.\n\n9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

Neither party will be\nliable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort\nsolely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its\nterms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to\nany other right or remedy of either party.\n\n13.

Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nwill not apply to this License.\n\n13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\njurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,\nto be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to\nthe maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits\nand intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will\ncontinue in full force and effect.
