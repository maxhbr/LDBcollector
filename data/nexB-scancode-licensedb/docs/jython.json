HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n=======================================================\n\nJPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the\nprimary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw\ntook over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.\n\nIn October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge\nwhere it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed\nunder the Jython specific license below.\n\nFrom the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed\nPython Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are\ncovered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.\n\nThe standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation\nlicense as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.\n\nThe zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed\nunder the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython\nSoftware License.\n\nThe command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software\nLicense.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details."
