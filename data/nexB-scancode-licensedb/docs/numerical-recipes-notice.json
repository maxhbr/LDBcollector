  "text": "Types of License Offered\n\nHere are the types of licenses that we offer. Note that some types are\nautomatically acquired with the purchase of media from Cambridge University\nPress, or of an unlocking password from the Numerical Recipes On-Line Software\nStore, while other types of licenses require that you communicate specifically with\nNumerical Recipes Software (email: orders@nr.com or fax: 781 863-1739). Our\nWeb site http://www.nr.com has additional information.\n\n- \"Immediate License\" If you are the individual owner of a copy of this book and\nyou type one or more of its routines into your computer, we authorize you to use\nthem on that computer for your own personal and noncommercial purposes. You\nare not authorized to transfer or distribute machine-readable copies to any other\nperson, or to use the routines on more than one machine, or to distribute executable\nprograms containing our routines. This is the only free license.\n\n- \"Single-Screen License\" This is the most common type of low-cost license, with\nterms governed by our Single Screen (Shrinkwrap) License document (complete\nterms available through ourWeb site). Basically, this license lets you use Numerical\nRecipes routines on any one screen (PC, workstation, X-terminal, etc.). You may\nalso, under this license, transfer pre-compiled, executable programs incorporating\nour routines to other, unlicensed, screens or computers, providing that (i) your\napplication is noncommercial (i.e., does not involve the selling of your program\nfor a fee), (ii) the programs were first developed, compiled, and successfully run\non a licensed screen, and (iii) our routines are bound into the programs in such a\nmanner that they cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably\nbe unbound and used in other programs. That is, under this license, your program\nuser must not be able to use our programs as part of a program library or \"mix-andmatch\"\nworkbench. Conditions for other types of commercial or noncommercial\ndistribution may be found on our Web site (http://www.nr.com).\n\n- \"Multi-Screen, Server, Site, and Corporate Licenses\" The terms of the Single\nScreen License can be extended to designated groups of machines, defined by\nnumber of screens, number of machines, locations, or ownership. Significant\ndiscounts from the corresponding single-screen prices are available when the\nestimated number of screens exceeds 40. Contact Numerical Recipes Software\n(email: orders@nr.com or fax: 781 863-1739) for details.\n\n- \"Course Right-to-Copy License\" Instructors at accredited educational institutions\nwho have adopted this book for a course, and who have already purchased a Single\nScreen License (either acquired with the purchase of media, or from the Numerical\nRecipes On-Line Software Store), may license the programs for use in that course\nas follows: Mail your name, title, and address; the course name, number, dates,\nand estimated enrollment; and advance payment of $5 per (estimated) student'\nto Numerical Recipes Software, at this address: P.O. Box 243, Cambridge, MA\n02238 (USA). You will receive by return mail a license authorizing you to make\ncopies of the programs for use by your students, and/or to transfer the programs to\na machine accessible to your students (but only for the duration of the course).\n\nAbout Copyrights on Computer Programs\nLike artistic or literary compositions, computer programs are protected by\ncopyright. Generally it is an infringement for you to copy into your computer a\nprogram from a copyrighted source. (It is also not a friendly thing to do, since it\ndeprives the program's author of compensation for his or her creative effort.) Under\ncopyright law, all \"derivative works\" (modified versions, or translations into another\ncomputer language) also come under the same copyright as the original work.\nCopyright does not protect ideas, but only the expression of those ideas in\na particular form. In the case of a computer program, the ideas consist of the\nprogram's methodology and algorithm, including the necessary sequence of steps\nadopted by the programmer. The expression of those ideas is the program source\ncode (particularly any arbitrary or stylistic choices embodied in it), its derived object\ncode, and any other derivative works.\n\nIf you analyze the ideas contained in a program, and then express those\nideas in your own completely different implementation, then that new program\nimplementation belongs to you. That is what we have done for those programs in\nthis book that are not entirely of our own devising. When programs in this book are\nsaid to be \"based\" on programs published in copyright sources, we mean that the\nideas are the same. The expression of these ideas as source code is our own. We\nbelieve that no material in this book infringes on an existing copyright.\n\nTrademarks\nSeveral registered trademarks appear within the text of this book: Sun is a\ntrademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. SPARC and SPARCstation are trademarks\nof SPARC International, Inc. Microsoft, Windows 95, Windows NT, PowerStation,\nand MS are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation. DEC, VMS, Alpha AXP, and\nULTRIX are trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM is a trademark of\nInternational Business Machines Corporation. Apple and Macintosh are trademarks\nof Apple Computer, Inc. UNIX is a trademark licensed exclusively through X/Open\nCo. Ltd. IMSL is a trademark of Visual Numerics, Inc. NAG refers to proprietary\ncomputer software of Numerical Algorithms Group (USA) Inc. PostScript and\nAdobe Illustrator are trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Last, and no doubt\nleast, Numerical Recipes (when identifying products) is a trademark of Numerical\nRecipes Software.\n\nAttributions\nThe fact that ideas are legally \"free as air\" in no way supersedes the ethical\nrequirement that ideas be credited to their known originators. When programs in\nthis book are based on known sources, whether copyrighted or in the public domain,\npublished or \"handed-down,\" we have attempted to give proper attribution. Unfortunately,\nthe lineage of many programs in common circulation is often unclear. We\nwould be grateful to readers for new or corrected information regarding attributions,\nwhich we will attempt to incorporate in subsequent printings."
