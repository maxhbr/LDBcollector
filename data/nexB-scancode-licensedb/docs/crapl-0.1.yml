text: "                        THE CRAPL v0 BETA 1\n\n\n0. Information about the CRAPL\n\nIf\
  \ you have questions or concerns about the CRAPL, or you need more\ninformation about this\
  \ license, please contact:\n\n   Matthew Might\n   http://matt.might.net/\n\n\nI. Preamble\n\
  \nScience thrives on openness.\n\nIn modern science, it is often infeasible to replicate claims\
  \ without\naccess to the software underlying those claims.\n\nLet's all be honest: when scientists\
  \ write code, aesthetics and\nsoftware engineering principles take a back seat to having running,\n\
  working code before a deadline.\n\nSo, let's release the ugly.  And, let's be proud of that.\n\
  \n\nII. Definitions\n\n1. \"This License\" refers to version 0 beta 1 of the Community\n \
  \   Research and Academic Programming License (the CRAPL). \n\n2. \"The Program\" refers to\
  \ the medley of source code, shell scripts,\n    executables, objects, libraries and build\
  \ files supplied to You,\n    or these files as modified by You.\n\n   [Any appearance of\
  \ design in the Program is purely coincidental and\n    should not in any way be mistaken\
  \ for evidence of thoughtful\n    software construction.]\n\n3. \"You\" refers to the person\
  \ or persons brave and daft enough to use\n    the Program.\n\n4. \"The Documentation\" refers\
  \ to the Program.\n\n5. \"The Author\" probably refers to the caffeine-addled graduate\n \
  \   student that got the Program to work moments before a submission\n    deadline.\n\n\n\
  III. Terms\n\n1. By reading this sentence, You have agreed to the terms and\n   conditions\
  \ of this License.\n  \n2. If the Program shows any evidence of having been properly tested\n\
  \   or verified, You will disregard this evidence.\n\n3. You agree to hold the Author free\
  \ from shame, embarrassment or\n   ridicule for any hacks, kludges or leaps of faith found\
  \ within the\n   Program.\n\n4. You recognize that any request for support for the Program\
  \ will be\n   discarded with extreme prejudice.\n\n5. The Author reserves all rights to the\
  \ Program, except for any\n   rights granted under any additional licenses attached to the\n\
  \   Program.\n\n\nIV. Permissions\n\n1. You are permitted to use the Program to validate published\n\
  \   scientific claims.\n\n2. You are permitted to use the Program to validate scientific claims\n\
  \   submitted for peer review, under the condition that You keep\n   modifications to the\
  \ Program confidential until those claims have\n   been published.\n \n3. You are permitted\
  \ to use and/or modify the Program for the\n   validation of novel scientific claims if You\
  \ make a good-faith\n   attempt to notify the Author of Your work and Your claims prior to\n\
  \   submission for publication.\n \n4. If You publicly release any claims or data that were\
  \ supported or\n   generated by the Program or a modification thereof, in whole or in\n  \
  \ part, You will release any inputs supplied to the Program and any\n   modifications You\
  \ made to the Progam.  This License will be in\n   effect for the modified program.\n\n\n\
  V. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\
  \ BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR\
  \ OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\
  \ OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\
  \ FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF\
  \ THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\
  \ NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n\nVI. Limitation of Liability\n\nIN NO EVENT\
  \ UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR\
  \ ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO\
  \ YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n\
  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS\
  \ OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR\
  \ A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\n\
  PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."
