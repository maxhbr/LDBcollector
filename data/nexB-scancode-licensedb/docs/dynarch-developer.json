Sometimes we might use \"you\" as a synonym.\n\nOther terms that might be used\n\n    \"Application\", \"Software Application\" or \"Web Application\": will refer to an application developed by the LICENSEE. An Application has a finite scope.\n    \"Library\", \"Software Library\": refers to a possibly reusable collection of tools intended to help developers build Applications.\n\nHere is an example to make clear the distinction between an Application and a Library: the Opera Web Browser is an Application built on top of the Qt Toolkit. While Opera has a finite scope (it is a Web browser), Qt is also used in a lot of other applications, for instance the KDE Desktop. Qt is a Library for developers, while Opera is a general audience Application.\n\nLicense agreement\n\nLICENSEE is NOT allowed to modify or remove any copyright notices from any of the PRODUCT files.\n\nSubject to the terms of this agreement, Dynarch.com grants LICENSEE a non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to use the PRODUCT in any number of Applications developed by the LICENSEE, as long as the PRODUCT does not make the main nor major functionality of any of those Applications.\n\nThe LICENSEE may distribute such Applications incorporating the PRODUCT without paying royalty fees to Dynarch.com.\n\nThe PRODUCT can NOT be redistributed as part of a Software Library.
