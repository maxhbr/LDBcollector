  "text": "COPYING CONDITIONS FOR TeX Live:\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all software in the TeX Live distribution\nis freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis),\nwithin the Free Software Foundation's definition and the Debian Free\nSoftware Guidelines.  Where the two conflict, we generally follow the\nFSF (see [*] below).  If you find any non-free files included, please\ncontact us (references given at the end).\n\nThat said, TeX Live has neither a single copyright holder nor a single\nlicense covering its entire contents, since it is a collection of many\ndisparate packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or\nredistribute software from TeX Live only if you comply with the\nrequirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective packages.\n\nTo most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the TeX\nCatalogue at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/ (or any\nCTAN mirror).  The Catalogue is also included in TeX Live in\n./texmf/doc/html/catalogue/, but the online version will have updates.\nOf course the legal statements within the packages themselves are the\nfinal authority.\n\nIn some cases, TeX Live is distributed with a snapshot of the CTAN\narchive, which is entirely independent of and separable from TeX Live\nitself.  (The \"live\" DVD in the TeX Collection is one example of this.)\nPlease be aware that the CTAN snapshot contains many files which are\n*not* freely redistributable; see LICENSE.CTAN for more information.\n\n\nGUIDELINES FOR REDISTRIBUTION:\n\nIn general, you may redistribute TeX Live, with or without modification,\nfor profit or not, according to the usual free software tenets.  Here\nare some general guidelines for doing this:\n\n- If you make any changes to the TeX Live distribution or any\npackage it contains, besides complying with any licensing requirements,\nyou must prominently mention such changes in your modified distribution\nso that users do not take your work for ours, and know to contact you,\nnot us, in case of questions or problems.  A new top-level\nREADME.<yourwork> file is a good place to describe the general situation.\n\n- Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or additions are made, we\nrecommend a clearly different title, such as \"<your work> DVD, based on\nTeX Live YYYY (with updates)\", where YYYY is the year of TeX Live you\nare using.  This credits both our work and yours.\n\n- You absolutely may *not* place your own copyright on the entire\ndistribution, since it is not your work (as stated above, TeX Live is\nnot created by any single person or entity).  Statements such as \"all\nrights reserved\" and \"may not be reproduced\" are especially\nreprehensible, since they are antithetical to the free software\nprinciples under which TeX Live is produced.\n\n- You may use any cover or media label designs that you wish.  Such\npackaging and marketing details are not covered by any TeX Live license.\n\n- Finally, we make the following requests (not legal requirements):\n\na) Acknowledging that TeX Live is developed as a joint effort by all TeX\n   user groups, and encouraging the user/reader to join their user group\n   of choice.  The web page http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html may be\n   referenced as a list of TeX user groups.\n\nb) Referencing the TeX Live home page: http://www.tug.org/texlive/\n\nSuch information may be placed on the label of your media, your cover,\nand/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the acknowledgements\nsection of a book).\n\nFinally, although it is again not at all a requirement, we'd like to\ninvite any redistributors to make a donation to the project, whether\ncash or in-kind, for example via https://www.tug.org/donate/dev.html.\nThanks.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, *please* contact us.  In general,\nwe appreciate being given the chance to review any TeX Live-related\nmaterial in advance of publication, simply to avoid mistakes.  It is\nmuch better to correct text on a CD label or in a book before thousands\nof copies are made!\n\nWe are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed as to\nour deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, be aware that\nTeX Live is produced entirely by volunteers, and no dates can be\nguaranteed.\n\n\nLICENSING FOR NEW PACKAGES:\n\nFinally, we are often asked what license to use for new work.  To be\nconsidered for inclusion on TeX Live, a package must use a free software\nlicense, such as the LaTeX Project Public License, the GNU General\nPublic License, the X Window System license, the modified BSD license,\netc.  Furthermore, all sources must be available, including for\ndocumentation files.  Please see the url's below for more information.\n\nThanks for your interest in TeX.\n\n- Karl Berry, editor, for the TeX Live team\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[*] Conflicts between FSF and Debian.\n\nThe most notable instance of legal conflict between the FSF definition\nof \"free software\" and the Debian Free Software Guidelines is in regard\nto the GNU Free Documentation License when \"invariant sections\" (e.g.,\nFront-Cover Texts, Back-Cover Texts, or Invariant Sections) are\nincluded.  (FSF considers it free, of course, and Debian doesn't.) \n\nThe most common instance of such a license is in documentation for\nofficial GNU packages -- such as GNU Texinfo, which is included in TeX\nLive.  There may be other GFDL'd files with invariant sections as well;\nwe have not exhaustively checked.\n\nFor TeX Live, we decided to follow the FSF, rather than Debian.  So such\ndocumentation *is* included in the original TeX Live distribution.  (In\nrepackagings of TL according to Debian rules, it is removed.)  We surely\nwish these two major organizations in the free software world could\ncooperate on a documentation license acceptable to both.\n\nIf other specific conflicts are brought to our attention, we will note\nthem here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTeX Live mailing list: texlive@tug.org\nTeX Live home page: http://www.tug.org/tex-live/\n\nThe FSF's free software definition: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\nDebian Free Software Guidelines:    http://www.debian.org/intro/free\nFSF commentary on existing licenses:\n  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html\n\nLPPL: http://latex-project.org/lppl.html or texmf/doc/latex/base/lppl.txt\nLPPL rationale: texmf/doc/latex/base/modguide.pdf"
