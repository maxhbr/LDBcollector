While sample code may have been reviewed by IBM for accuracy in a specific situation there is no guarantee that the same or similar results will be obtained elsewhere.  Customers attempting to use Sample Code in their own environments do so at their own risk.\n\nSUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE  EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING  WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE SAMPLE CODE.\n\nThe exclusion also applies to any of IBM's subcontractors,  suppliers, or program developers (collectively called \"Suppliers\").\n\n3.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW  THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n4.
