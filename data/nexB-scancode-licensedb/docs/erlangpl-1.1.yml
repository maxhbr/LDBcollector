  \ Section 2.2. The Source\nCode version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the\
  \ terms\nof this License, and You must include a copy of this License with\nevery copy of\
  \ the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or\nimpose any terms on any Source Code\
  \ version that alters or restricts\nthe applicable version of this License or the recipients'\
  \ rights\nhereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering\nthe additional\
  \ rights described in Section 3.5. \n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\nAny Modification\
  \ which You contribute must be made available in Source\nCode form under the terms of this\
  \ License either on the same media as\nan Executable version or via an accepted Electronic\
  \ Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand\
  \ if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least\
  \ twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months\
  \ after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to\
  \ such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains\
  \ available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\
  \n3.3. Description of Modifications.\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute\
  \ to contain a\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\nthe\
  \ date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\nthe Modification is derived,\
  \ directly or indirectly, from Original\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including\
  \ the name of the\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n\
  Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\norigin or ownership\

  \    If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property\n    right in particular\
  \ functionality or code (or its utilization\n    under this License), you must include a text\
  \ file with the source\n    code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and\n\
  \    the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\n    will know whom\
  \ to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You\n    make Your Modification available\
  \ as described in Section 3.2, You\n    shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\
  \ You make\n    available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n    appropriate\
  \ mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to\n    inform those who received the\
  \ Covered Code that new knowledge has\n    been obtained. \n\n(b) Contributor APIs.\n    If\
  \ Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n    You own or control patents\
  \ which are reasonably necessary to\n    implement that API, you must also include this information\
  \ in the\n    LEGAL file. \n\n3.5. Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\
  \ A in each file of the Source\nCode, and this License in any documentation for the Source\
  \ Code, where\nYou describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You\ncreated one\
  \ or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described\
  \ in Exhibit A. If it is not\npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file\
  \ due to\nits structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such\nas a relevant\
  \ directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\nsuch a notice. You may choose\
  \ to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations\
  \ to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf,\
  \ and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely\
  \ clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\
  \ You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor\
  \ for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of\
  \ warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable\
  \ Versions.\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\nrequirements\
  \ of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\nand if You include a notice stating\
  \ that the Source Code version of\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n\
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\nobligations of Section 3.2.\
  \ The notice must be conspicuously included\nin any notice in an Executable version, related\
  \ documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n\
  Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode under a license of\
  \ Your choice, which may contain terms different\nfrom this License, provided that You are\
  \ in compliance with the terms\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version\
  \ does\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source\nCode version from\
  \ the rights set forth in this License. If You\ndistribute the Executable version under a\
  \ different license You must\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this\
  \ License\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You\
  \ hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\nevery Contributor for any liability\
  \ incurred by the Initial Developer\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You\
  \ offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with\
  \ other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as\
  \ a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are\
  \ fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect\
  \ to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply\
  \ with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations\
  \ and\nthe code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL\nfile described\
  \ in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to\
  \ the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\n\
  for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\
  \nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in\
  \ Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nThis\
