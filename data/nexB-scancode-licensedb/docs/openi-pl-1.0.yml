  \ \nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are \ngoverned by the terms\
  \ of this License, including without limitation \nSection 2.2. The Source Code version of\
  \ Covered Code may be distributed \nonly under the terms of this License or a future version\
  \ of this License \nreleased under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License\n\
  with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or \nimpose any terms\
  \ on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the \napplicable version of this License\
  \ or the recipients' rights hereunder. \nHowever, You may include an additional document offering\
  \ the additional \nrights described in Section 3.5. \n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \n\
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made \navailable in Source\
  \ Code form under the terms of this License either on \nthe same media as an Executable version\
  \ or via an accepted Electronic \nDistribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable\
  \ version \navailable; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, \nmust\
  \ remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it \ninitially became available,\
  \ or at least six (6) months after a subsequent \nversion of that particular Modification\
  \ has been made available to such \nrecipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the\
  \ Source Code version \nremains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is\
  \ \nmaintained by a third party. \n\n3.3. Description of Modifications. \nYou must cause all\
  \ Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file \ndocumenting the changes You made\
  \ to create that Covered Code and the date of \nany change. You must include a prominent statement\
  \ that the Modification is \nderived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided\
  \ by the Initial \nDeveloper and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\
  \ \nCode, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation \nin which\
  \ You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \n\n3.4. Intellectual Property\
  \ Matters \n\n(a) Third Party Claims. \nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under\
  \ a third party's intellectual \nproperty rights is required to exercise the rights granted\
  \ by such Contributor \nunder Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with\
  \ the Source \nCode distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party\
  \ making \nthe claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If \n\
  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as \ndescribed\
  \ in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in \nall copies Contributor\
  \ makes available thereafter and shall take other steps \n(such as notifying appropriate mailing\
  \ lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated \nto inform those who received the Covered Code\
  \ that new knowledge has been obtained. \n(b) Contributor APIs. \nIf Contributor's Modifications\
  \ include an application programming interface and \nContributor has knowledge of patent licenses\
  \ which are reasonably necessary to \nimplement that API, Contributor must also include this\
  \ information in the LEGAL \nfile. \n \n\n          (c)    Representations. \nContributor\
  \ represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) \nabove, Contributor believes\
  \ that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's \noriginal creation(s) and/or Contributor\
  \ has sufficient rights to grant the \nrights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\
  \ \nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  \nIf it is\
  \ not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file \ndue to its structure,\
  \ then You must include such notice in a location (such \nas a relevant directory) where a\
  \ user would be likely to look for such a \nnotice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\
  \ You may add your name as \na Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must\
  \ also duplicate \nthis License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe\
  \ \nrecipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may \nchoose to\
  \ offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or \nliability obligations\
  \ to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You \nmay do so only on Your own behalf,\
  \ and not on behalf of the Initial Developer \nor any Contributor. You must make it absolutely\
  \ clear than any such warranty, \nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\
  \ You alone, and You \nhereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\
  \ for any \nliability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\
  \ \nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable\
  \ Versions. \nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements\
  \ \nof Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include \na notice\
  \ stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available \nunder the terms\
  \ of this License, including a description of how and where \nYou have fulfilled the obligations\
  \ of Section 3.2. The notice must be \nconspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\
  \ version, related \ndocumentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights\
  \ relating \nto the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \n\
  Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain \nterms different\
  \ from this License, provided that You are in compliance with \nthe terms of this License\
  \ and that the license for the Executable version \ndoes not attempt to limit or alter the\
  \ recipient's rights in the Source Code \nversion from the rights set forth in this License.\
  \ If You distribute the \nExecutable version under a different license You must make it absolutely\
  \ \nclear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, \nnot by\
  \ the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify \nthe Initial Developer\
  \ and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \nInitial Developer or such Contributor\
  \ as a result of any such terms You offer. \n\n3.7. Larger Works. \nYou may create a Larger\
  \ Work by combining Covered Code with other code not \ngoverned by the terms of this License\
  \ and distribute the Larger Work as a \nsingle product. In such a case, You must make sure\
  \ the requirements of this \nLicense are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to\
  \ Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of\
  \ the terms of this License\nwith respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,\
  \ judicial order, \nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\
  \ to the \nmaximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they \n\
  affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in \nSection 3.4 and\
  \ must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. \nExcept to the extent prohibited\
  \ by statute or regulation, such description \nmust be sufficiently detailed for a recipient\
  \ of ordinary skill to be able \nto understand it.\n5. Application of this License. \nThis\
  \ License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the \nnotice in Exhibit\
  \ A and to related Covered Code.\n6. Versions of the License. \n6.1. New Versions. \nLoyalty\
  \ Matrix Inc. (''Loyalty Matrix'') may publish revised and/or new \nversions of the License\
  \ from time to time. Each version will be given a \ndistinguishing version number. \n6.2.\
  \ Effect of New Versions. \nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version\
  \ of the License, \nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\
  \ may also \nchoose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of\
  \ the \nLicense published by Loyalty Matrix. No one other than Loyalty Matrix has the \nright\
  \ to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \n\n6.3. Derivative\
  \ Works. \nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do\
  \ \nin order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this \nLicense),\
  \ You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''OpenI'', \n''OPL'', ''Loyalty Matrix'',\
  \ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in \nyour license (except to note that your\
  \ license differs from this License) and \n(b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of\
  \ the license contains terms \nwhich differ from the OpenI Public License. (Filling in the\
  \ name of the Initial \nDeveloper, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\
  \ Exhibit A \nshall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n\
  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS,\
  \ WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\
  \ WARRANTIES \nTHAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\
  \ PURPOSE \nOR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED\
  \ \nCODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT \n\
  THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY \nSERVICING,\
  \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL \nPART OF THIS\
  \ LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT \nUNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
  \n8. TERMINATION. \n8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\
  \ if \nYou fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\
  \ \nbecoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly \n\
  granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their \nnature,\
  \ must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n\n8.2.  If\
  \ You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding \ndeclatory\
  \ judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial \nDeveloper or\
  \ Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \n\"Participant\")  alleging\
  \ that: \n\n(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any\
  \ patent, \nthen any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1\
  \ and/or \n2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\
  \ \nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to\
  \ \npay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use \n\
  of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim \nwith respect\
  \ to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days \nof notice, a reasonable\
  \ royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon \nin writing by the parties\
  \ or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted \nby Participant to You under\
  \ Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the \nexpiration of the 60 day notice\
  \ period specified above. \n\n(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\
  \ Contributor Version, \ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted\
  \ to You by such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of\
  \ the date You \nfirst made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\
  \ Participant. \n\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging\
  \ that such \nParticipant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent\
  \ where such \nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation\
  \ of patent \ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by\
  \ such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining\
  \ the \namount or value of any payment or license. \n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under\
  \ Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and\
  \ resellers) which have been validly granted by You \nor any distributor hereunder prior to\
  \ termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES\
  \ AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), \nCONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,\
  \ SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY \nDISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED\
  \ CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY \nPERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,\
  \ SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER \nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\
  \ DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER \nFAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND\
  \ ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH \nPARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF\
  \ THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF \nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\
  \ FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH \nPARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE\
  \ LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME \nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION\
  \ OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL \nDAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY\
  \ TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as\
  \ that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 \n(Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer\

  \ only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \nThis License represents the\

  \ and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. \nThe application of the United Nations Convention\
  \ on Contracts for the International Sale of \nGoods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\
  \ which provides that the language of a \ncontract shall be construed against the drafter\
  \ shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \nAs between Initial\
  \ Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims \nand damages arising,\
  \ directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this \nLicense and You agree\
