INTRODUCTION\nThe Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android (\"FDK AAC Codec\") is software that implements\nthe MPEG Advanced Audio Coding (\"AAC\") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.\nThis FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.\n\nAAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual\naudio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by\nindependent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part\nof the MPEG specifications.\n\nPatent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)\nmay be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners\nindividually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with\nthe ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license\nthese patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec\nsoftware may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.\n\nCommercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,\nare also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional\napplications information and documentation.\n\n2.    COPYRIGHT LICENSE\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted without\npayment of copyright license fees provided that you satisfy the following conditions:\n\nYou must retain the complete text of this software license in redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or\nyour modifications thereto in source code form.\n\nYou must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation and/or other materials\nprovided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in binary form.\nYou must make available free of charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your\nmodifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.\n\nThe name of Fraunhofer may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this library without\nprior written permission.\n\nYou may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute the FDK AAC Codec\nsoftware or your modifications thereto.\n\nYour modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the software\nand the date of any change. For modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec, the term\n\"Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android\" must be replaced by the term\n\"Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android.\"\n\n3.    NO PATENT LICENSE\n\nNO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without limitation the patents of Fraunhofer,\nARE GRANTED BY THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE. Fraunhofer provides no warranty of patent non-infringement with\nrespect to this software.\n\nYou may use this FDK AAC Codec software or modifications thereto only for purposes that are authorized\nby appropriate patent licenses.\n\n4.    DISCLAIMER\n\nThis FDK AAC Codec software is provided by Fraunhofer on behalf of the copyright holders and contributors\n\"AS IS\" and WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, including but not limited to the implied warranties\nof merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
