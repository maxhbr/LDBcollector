  \n\nNotice\n------\n\n\nThis Agreement is a free software license that is the result of  discussions\n\
  between its authors  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  two  main\nprinciples guiding\
  \ its drafting:\n   - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law\
  \  of\n     torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers\n     to\
  \ authors and the holders of economic rights over software.\n   - secondly, compliance with\
  \ the principles for the distribution  of  free\n     software: access to source codes, extended\
  \ user-rights.\n\nThe following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C\
  \ :\nCNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):\n\nCommissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a\
  \ public scientific, technical  and\nindustrial establishment, having its principal place\
  \ of  business  at  31-33\nrue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15.\n\nCentre National\

  \n\nThe purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the\nright to\
  \ modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license\nwithin the framework\
  \ of an \"open source\" distribution model.\n\nThe exercising of these rights is conditional\
  \ upon certain  obligations  for\nusers  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained\
  \  for  subsequent\nredistribution operations.\n\nNevertheless, access to the source code,\
  \ and the resulting rights  to  copy,\nmodify and redistribute only provide users with a limited\

  licensors only have limited liability.\n\nIn this respect, the user's attention is drawn to\
  \ the risks associated  with\nloading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the\
  \  software  by\nthe user in light of its specific status of free  software,  that  may  mean\n\
  that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that  it\nis reserved\
  \ for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth  IT\nknowledge. Users are therefore\
  \ encouraged to load and  test  the  Software's\nsuitability  as  regards  their  requirements\
  \  in  conditions  enabling  the\nsecurity of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,\
  \ more generally,  to\nuse and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  as  regards  security.\
  \  This\nAgreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published,  provided  it  is  not\naltered,\
  \ and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.\n\nThis Agreement may apply to\

  \ Licensee harmless against  any  or\nall proceedings for infringement that may be instituted\

  \  should\nsuch proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall\n\
  provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such\ntechnical and\
  \ legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case\nbasis  between  the  relevant\

  \ remained\nineffective.\n\n10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall \
  \ no  longer  be\nauthorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or\
  \  all\nlicenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement\nshall\
