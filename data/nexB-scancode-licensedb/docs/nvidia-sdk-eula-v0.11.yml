  Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing, copying or using the
  licensed software:
  This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement”) is a
  legal agreement
  between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a
  NVIDIA
  software development kit (“SDK”).
  Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a
  description of the types
  of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs,
  data sets and
  assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native
  API input/
  output files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs,
  programming
  code and documentation.
  This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in
  the country
  in which the SDK is used.
  If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other
  legal entity, you
  represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this
  Agreement, in which
  case “you” will mean the entity you represent.
  If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement,
  or if you don’t
  accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download,
  install or use
  the SDK.
  You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
  Agreement,
  and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
  guidelines in
  the relevant jurisdictions.

  \ \n\n1.1. License \n\n1.1.1. License Grant \n\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA\
  \ hereby grants you a non-exclusive, nontransferable \nlicense, without the right to sublicense\
  \ (except as expressly provided in this \nAgreement) to:\n\n1. \nInstall and use the SDK,\
  \ \n2. \nModify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SDK, \n\
  and \n3. \nDistribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as \n\
  distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that \nmeets\
  \ the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement. \n\n1.1.2. Distribution Requirements\
  \ \n\nThese are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:\n\
  1. \nYour application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included \n\
  portions of the SDK. \n2. \nThe distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by\
  \ your application. \n3. \nThe following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative\
  \ works of \nsample source code distributed: “This software contains source code provided\
  \ by \nNVIDIA Corporation.” \n4. \nUnless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement\
  \ as distributable, it is \ndelivered for your internal use only. \n5. \nThe terms under which\
  \ you distribute your application must be consistent with the \nterms of this Agreement, including\
  \ (without limitation) terms relating to the license \ngrant and license restrictions and\
  \ protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property \nrights. Additionally, you agree that you\
  \ will protect the privacy, security and legal \nrights of your application users. \n6. \n\
  You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or \nuse of the\
  \ SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to \nenforce the terms\
  \ of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK. \n\n1.1.3. Authorized Users \n\nYou\
  \ may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to \naccess\
  \ and use the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf. \n\nIf you are\
  \ an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by the \nacademic institution\
  \ to access and use the SDK from your secure network. \n\nYou are responsible for the compliance\
  \ with the terms of this Agreement by your \nauthorized users. If you become aware that your\
  \ authorized users didn’t follow \nthe terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable\
  \ steps to resolve the noncompliance \nand prevent new occurrences. \n\n1.1.4. Pre-Release\
  \ SDK \n\nThe SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release,\
  \ may \nnot be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced\
  \ or \ndifferent security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards\
  \ relative to \ncommercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release\
  \ SDK may \nresult in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable\
  \ damage \nor loss. \n\nYou may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that\
  \ pre-release SDKs \nare not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.\
  \ \n\nNVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK.\
  \ \nNVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a \npre-release\
  \ SDK at any time without liability. \n\n1.1.5. Updates \n\nNVIDIA may, at its option, make\
  \ available patches, workarounds or other updates to \nthis SDK. Unless the updates are provided\
  \ with their separate governing terms, they are \ndeemed part of the SDK licensed to you as\
  \ provided in this Agreement. You agree that \nthe form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA\
  \ provides may change without prior notice \nto you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility\
  \ between versions, NVIDIA \nmay in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities\
  \ in future versions of \nthe SDK. \n\n1.1.6. Third Party Licenses \n\nThe SDK may come bundled\
  \ with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, third \nparty software licensed by a\
  \ NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided \nunder an open source license. Use\
  \ of third party software is subject to the third-party \nlicense terms, or in the absence\

  \ license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:\n1. \nYou may not reverse engineer, decompile\
  \ or disassemble, or remove copyright or \nother proprietary notices from any portion of the\
  \ SDK or copies of the SDK. \n2. \nExcept as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may\
  \ not copy, sell, rent, \nsublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works\
  \ of any portion of \nthe SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as\

  \ that the SDK be: \na. \nDisclosed or distributed in source code form; \nb. \nLicensed for\
  \ the purpose of making derivative works; or \nc. \nRedistributable at no charge. \n6. \n\
  Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use \nthe SDK with\

  \ the payment of any royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback \nat its choice. NVIDIA\
  \ is constantly looking for ways to improve its products, \nso you may send feedback to NVIDIA\
  \ through the developer portal at https:// \ndeveloper.nvidia.com. \n\n1.4. No Warranties\
  \ \n\nTHE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO \nTHE MAXIMUM EXTENT\
  \ PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES \nEXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\
  \ OR NATURE, WHETHER \nEXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY \n\
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, \nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\
