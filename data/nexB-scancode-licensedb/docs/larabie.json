  "text": "The fonts contained in this archive are Freeware. No payment is required for the use of these fonts.  They're free!\nCommercial use?  Sure, but a donation or a product sample would be appreciated.\n\n$40 US is the usual donation amount per font for commercial use but any amount is appreciated.\n\nI make all the fonts (over 400 of them) on my web page and they're all free. I offer Deluxe versions of some of my\nfonts for sale.  They contain several weights and styles of each font.  Just click on \"DELUXE FONTS\" at\nLarabie Fonts to see them.\n\nThe site is called Larabie Fonts and it can be found at various mirror sites:\n\ntry:\nhttp://www.larabiefonts.com\nhttp://uk.zarcrom.com/font/\nhttp://come.to/larabiefonts\n\nI've provided the world with over 400 free fonts, so if you'd like to make a donation I'd be more than happy to accept it.\nNo donation is too small.\n\nSend anything at all to\n\nRay Larabie\n61 Wesley Ave.\nPort Credit\nOntario, CANADA\nL5H 2M8\n\nIf you decide to send a cheque (that's how we spell it in Canada) make it payable to Ray Larabie.

You can give the font away as long as it hasn't been altered and this text file\nremains with the font.  Don't remove or alter the copyright notice on the font.  Don't convert the fonts if the conversion\nprogram alters the copyright notice.  If my font makes your hair fall out - thats' too damn bad!\n\n\n-------------------------------\nLarabie Fonts End-user license agreement software product from Larabie Fonts\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE\n\nThe SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties,\nas well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.
