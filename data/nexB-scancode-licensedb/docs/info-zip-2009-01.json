Additional documentation is not needed for executables where a\n    command line license option provides these and a note regarding this option\n    is in the executable's startup banner. The sole exception to this condition\n    is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part\n    of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this\n    license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from the\n    binary or disabled.\n\n    Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating\n    systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with\n    modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library\n    versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not be\n    misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries, compiled from\n    the original source.

Such altered\n    versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs\n    or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-\n    ZIP will provide support for the altered versions.\n\n    Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names \"Info-ZIP,\" \"Zip,\" \"UnZip,\"\n    \"UnZipSFX,\" \"WiZ,\" \"Pocket UnZip,\" \"Pocket Zip,\" and \"MacZip\" for its own\n    source and binary releases."
