text: "This is the Info-ZIP file COPYING (for UnZip), last updated 5 Oct 97.\n\n\nThere are\
  \ currently six explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip\ncode (at least, of which Info-ZIP\
  \ is aware):  the original Sam Smith\ncopyright on unzip 2.0, upon which Info-ZIP's UnZip\
  \ 3.0 was based;\nIgor Mandrichenko's copyright on his routines in vms.c; Greg Roelofs'\n\
  copyright on zipinfo.c and the new version of unshrink.c; Mike White's\ncopyright on the Windows\
  \ DLL code (windll/*); Steve P. Miller's\ncopyright on the Pocket UnZip GUI (wince/*); and\
  \ Norbert Pueschel's\ncopyright on the Amiga time.lib code.  In addition, Mark Adler has\n\
  placed inflate.h, inflate.c, explode.c and funzip.c into the public\ndomain; i.e., these files\
  \ may be used without any restrictions beyond\nthose of simple courtesy (credit where it's\
  \ due).  All of these are\ndiscussed immediately below.  The remaining code is covered by\
  \ an im-\nplicit copyright under US law.  Frequently Asked Questions regarding\n(re)distribution\
  \ of Zip and UnZip are near the end of this file.\n\nThere are no known patents on any of\
  \ the code in UnZip.  Unisys\nclaims a patent on LZW encoding and on LZW decoding _in an apparatus\n\
  that performs LZW encoding_, but the patent appears to exempt a stand-\nalone decoder (as\
  \ in UnZip's unshrink.c).  Unisys has publicly claimed\notherwise, but the issue has never\
  \ been tested in court.  Since this\npoint is unclear, unshrinking is not enabled by default.\
  \  It is the\nresponsibility of the user to make his or her peace with Unisys and\nits licensing\
  \ requirements.  (unshrink.c may be removed from future\nreleases altogether.)\n\n\nThe original\
  \ unzip source code has been extensively modified and\nalmost entirely rewritten (changes\
  \ include random zipfile access\nrather than sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode();\n\
  replacement of old unshrink() with new (unrelated) unshrink(); re-\nplacement of output routines;\
  \ addition of inflate(), wildcards,\nfilename-mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far\
  \ as we can\ntell, the only remaining code that is substantially similar to\nMr. Smith's is\
  \ that in the file unreduce.c, which now by default\nis NOT compiled.  The following copyright\
  \ applies to unreduce.c:\n\n  * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved\n  *\n\
  \  * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.\n  * Do not remove or alter\
  \ this notice or any other copyright notice.\n  * If you use this in your own program you\
  \ must distribute source code.\n  * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.\n\nRegarding\
  \ the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was tracked down in southern\nCalifornia some years back\
  \ [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop; as of mid-\nMay 1994, (213) 851-9969 (voice), (213) 887-2127(?)\
  \ (subscription BBS),\n71150.2731@compuserve.com]:\n\n\"He says that he thought that whoever\
  \ contacted him understood that\n he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of\
  \ his code.\n His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said.\"\n\nDespite\
  \ the fact that our \"normal\" code has been entirely rewritten\nand by default no longer\
  \ contains any of Mr. Smith's code, Info-ZIP\nremains indebted and grateful to him.  We hope\
  \ he finds our contribu-\ntions as useful as we have his.\n\nNote that the third and fourth\
  \ stipulations still apply to any com-\npany that wishes to incorporate the unreduce code\
  \ into its products;\nif you wish to do so, you must contact Mr. Smith directly regarding\n\
  licensing.\n\n\nThe following copyright applies to most of the VMS code in vms.c,\ndistributed\
  \ with UnZip version 4.2 and later:\n\n  * Copyright (c) 1992 Igor Mandrichenko.\n  * Permission\
  \ is granted to any individual or institution to use,\n  * copy, or redistribute this software\
  \ so long as all of the orig-\n  * inal files are included unmodified, that it is not sold\
  \ for\n  * profit, and that this copyright notice is retained.\n\n\nThe following copyright\
  \ applies to the new version of unshrink.c,\ndistributed with UnZip version 5.2 and later:\n\
  \n  * Copyright (c) 1994 Greg Roelofs.\n  * Permission is granted to any individual/institution/corporate\n\
  \  * entity to use, copy, redistribute or modify this software for\n  * any purpose whatsoever,\
  \ subject to the conditions noted in the\n  * Frequently Asked Questions section below, plus\
  \ one additional\n  * condition:  namely, that my name not be removed from the source\n  *\
  \ code.  (Other names may, of course, be added as modifications\n  * are made.)  Corporate\
  \ legal staff (like at IBM :-) ) who have\n  * problems understanding this can contact me\
  \ through Zip-Bugs...\n\n\nThe following copyright applies to the Windows DLL code (windll/*),\n\
  distributed with UnZip version 5.2 and later:\n\n  * Copyright (c) 1996 Mike White.\n  * Permission\
  \ is granted to any individual or institution to use,\n  * copy, or redistribute this software\
  \ so long as all of the original\n  * files are included, that it is not sold for profit,\
  \ and that this\n  * copyright notice is retained.\n\n\nThe following copyright applies to\
  \ the Windows CE GUI port, ``Pocket\nUnZip,'' distributed with UnZip version 5.3 and later:\n\
  \n  * All the source files for Pocket UnZip, except for components\n  * written by the Info-ZIP\
  \ group, are copyrighted 1997 by Steve P.\n  * Miller.  The product \"Pocket UnZip\" itself\
  \ is property of the\n  * author and cannot be altered in any way without written consent\n\
  \  * from Steve P. Miller.\n\n\nThe following copyright applies to the Amiga time code (amiga/time_lib.c),\n\
  distributed with UnZip version 5.32 and later:\n\n  * This source is copyrighted by Norbert\
  \ Pueschel,\n  *   <pueschel@imsdd.meb.uni-bonn.de>.\n  * From 'clockdaemon.readme' (available\
  \ from Aminet, including\n  *   ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/time/clockdaemon.lha):\n\
  \  * \"The original SAS/C functions gmtime, localtime, mktime and time\n  * do not work correctly.\
  \ The supplied link library time.lib contains\n  * replacement functions for them.\"\n  *\
  \ Permission is granted to the Info-ZIP group to redistribute the\n  * time.lib source.  The\
  \ use of time.lib functions in own, noncommerical\n  * programs is permitted.  It is only\
  \ required to add the timezone.doc\n  * to such a distribution.  Using the time.lib library\
  \ in commerical\n  * software (including shareware) is only permitted after prior\n  * consultation\
  \ of the author.\n\n\nThe remaining code was written by many people associated with the\n\
  Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):\nGreg Roelofs (overall\
  \ program logic, ZipInfo, unshrink, filename\nmapping/portability, etc.), Mark Adler (inflate,\
  \ explode, funzip),\nKai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), Antoine\n\
  Verheijen (Macintosh), Hunter Goatley (more VMS), Mike White (Windows\nDLLs), Christian Spieler\
  \ (overall logic, optimization, VMS, etc.) and\nothers.  See the file CONTRIBS in the source\
  \ distribution for a much\nmore complete list of contributors.  As noted above, Mark Adler's\n\
  inflate.[ch], explode.c and funzip.c are in the public domain, and\neverything that isn't\
  \ otherwise accounted for is implicitly copy-\nrighted by Info-ZIP.  In other words, use it\
  \ with our blessings, but\nit's still our code.  Thank you!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
  \nFrequently Asked Questions about distributing Zip and UnZip:\n\n\nQ. Can I distribute Zip\
  \ and UnZip sources and/or executables?\n\nA. You may redistribute the latest official distributions\
  \ without\n   any modification, and without even asking us for permission.\n   (Note that\
  \ an \"executable distribution\" includes documentation,\n   even if it's in a separate zipfile;\
  \ plain executables do NOT\n   count.)  You can charge for the cost of the media (CDROM, disk-\n\
  \   ettes, etc.), the compilation (e.g., of a software archive),\n   and a small copying fee.\
  \  Distributed archives should follow\n   the naming conventions used in the `WHERE' file.\
  \  If you want\n   to distribute modified versions, please contact us at\n   Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu\
  \ first.  You must not distribute beta\n   versions without explicit permission to do so.\n\
  \n\nQ. Can I use the executables (or DLLs) of Zip and UnZip to distribute\n   my software?\n\
  \nA. Yes, so long as it is clear that Zip and UnZip are not being\n   sold, that the source\
  \ code is freely available, and that there\n   are no extra or hidden charges resulting from\
  \ its use by or in-\n   clusion with the commercial product.  Here is an example of a\n  \
  \ suitable notice:\n\n      NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's\n   \
  \   compression utility.  The installation program uses UnZip\n      to read zip files from\
  \ the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip,\n      UnZip and related utilities) is free and can be\
  \ obtained\n      as source code or executables from Internet/WWW sites,\n      including\
  \ http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ .\n\n   If the distribution is being done with UnZipSFX\
  \ instead of a DLL\n   or stand-alone copy of UnZip (i.e., as one or more self-extracting\n\
  \   archives), no notice is required as long as the normal UnZipSFX\n   banner has not been\
  \ removed.\n\n\nQ. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial\n   application?\n\
  \nA. Yes, so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment; a\n   pointer to the original,\
  \ free compression sources; and a statement\n   making it clear that there are no extra or\
  \ hidden charges resulting\n   from the use of our compression code in your product (see below\
  \ for\n   an example).  The acknowledgment should appear in at least one piece \n   of human-readable\
  \ documentation (e.g., a README file or man page),\n   although additionally putting it in\
  \ the executable(s) is OK, too.\n   In other words, you are allowed to sell only your own\
  \ work, not ours,\n   and we'd like a little credit.  (Note the additional restrictions\n\
  \   above on the code in unreduce.c, unshrink.c, vms.c, time_lib.c, and\n   everything in\
  \ the wince and windll subdirectories.)  Contact us at\n   Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu if you have\
  \ special requirements.  We also\n   like to hear when our code is being used, but we don't\
  \ require that.\n\n      <Product> incorporates compression code from the Info-ZIP group.\n\
  \      There are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code,\n      and the original\
  \ compression sources are freely available from\n      http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ or\
  \ ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/\n      on the Internet.\n\n   If you only need compression\
  \ capability, not full zipfile support,\n   you might want to look at zlib instead; it has\
  \ fewer restrictions\n   on commercial use.  See http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ ."
