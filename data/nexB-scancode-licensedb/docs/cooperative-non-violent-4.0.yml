  \ the following restrictions:\n\n          a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\
  \ only under\n          the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the\n  \
  \        Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every\n          copy of\
  \ the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not\n          offer or impose any\
  \ terms on the Work that restrict the terms of\n          this License or the ability of the\

  \ the terms of\n          the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep\n  \
  \        intact all notices that refer to this License and to the\n          disclaimer of\
  \ warranties with every copy of the Work You\n          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When\
  \ You Distribute or Publicly\n          Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\
  \ technological\n          measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n\
  \          the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n          recipient under\
  \ the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\n          applies to the Work as incorporated\
  \ in a Collection, but this\n          does not require the Collection apart from the Work\
  \ itself to be\n          made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a\n   \
  \       Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the\n          extent practicable,\
  \ remove from the Collection any credit as\n          required by Section 4(h), as requested.\
  \ If You create an\n          Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the\n\
  \          extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\n          required\
  \ by Section 4(h), as requested.\n\n          b. Subject to the exception in Section 4(e),\
  \ you may not\n          exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in\n\
  \          any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n          commercial\
  \ advantage or private monetary compensation. The\n          exchange of the Work for other\
  \ copyrighted works by means of\n          digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be\
  \ considered to be\n          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private\n\
  \          monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any\n          monetary\
  \ compensation in connection with the exchange of\n          copyrighted works.\n\n      \
  \    c. If the Work meets the definition of Software, You may exercise\n          the rights\
  \ granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the\n          corresponding Source Code\
  \ from which the Work was derived in digital\n          form, or You provide a URI for the\
  \ corresponding Source Code of\n          the Work, to any recipients upon request.\n\n  \
  \        d. If the Work is used as or for a Web Service, You may exercise\n          the rights\
  \ granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the\n          corresponding Source Code\

  \ corresponding Source Code to the\n          Work, to any recipients of the data served or\
  \ modified by the Web\n          Service.\n\n          e. You may exercise the rights granted\
  \ in Section 3 for\n          commercial purposes only if you satisfy any of the following:\n\
  \n                i. You are a worker-owned business or worker-owned\n                collective;\
  \ and\n                ii.  after tax, all financial gain, surplus, profits and \n       \
  \         benefits produced by the business or collective are\n                distributed\

  \ community projects as decided\n                by a previously-established consensus agreement\
  \ between the\n                worker-owners where all worker-owners agreed\n            \
  \    iii. You are not using such rights on behalf of a business\n                other than\
  \ those specified in 4(e.i) and elaborated upon in\n                4(e.ii), nor are using\

  \ the aforementioned\n                restrictions on such a business.\n\n          f. Any\
  \ use by a business that is privately owned and managed,\n          and that seeks to generate\

  \ under this\n          license.\n\n          g. You may exercise the rights granted in Section\
  \ 3 for\n          any purposes only if:\n\n              i. You do not use the Work for the\
  \ purpose of inflicting\n              Bodily Harm on human beings (subject to criminal\n\
  \              prosecution or otherwise) outside of providing medical aid.\n             \
  \ ii.You do not use the Work for the purpose of Surveilling\n              or tracking individuals\
  \ for financial gain.\n              iii. You do not use the Work in an Act of War.\n    \
  \          iv. You do not use the Work for the purpose of supporting\n              or profiting\
  \ from an Act of War.\n              v. You do not use the Work for the purpose of Incarceration.\n\
  \              vi. You do not use the Work for the purpose of extracting\n              oil,\
  \ gas, or coal.\n              vii. You do not use the Work for the purpose of\n         \

  \      gender identity, race, age, disability, color, national origin,\n              religion,\
  \ or lower economic status.\n\n          h. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work\
  \ or any\n          Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been\n    \
  \      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices\n          for the\
  \ Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You\n          are utilizing: (i) the\
  \ name of the Original Author (or\n          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or\
  \ if the Original\n          Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,\n\
  \          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution\n          (\"\
  Attribution Parties\") in Licensor!s copyright notice, terms of\n          service or by other\

  \ if supplied; (iii) to the\n          extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that\

  \ and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of\n          an Adaptation, a credit\

  \ of the Work by Original\n          Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n\
  \          Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(h) may be\n          implemented\
  \ in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in\n          the case of an Adaptation\
  \ or Collection, at a minimum such credit\n          will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
  \ authors of the\n          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits\n\
  \          and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n          other contributing\
  \ authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may\n          only use the credit required by\
  \ this Section for the purpose of\n          attribution in the manner set out above and,\
  \ by exercising Your\n          rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\n\

  \ to\n                collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the\n            \
  \    rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such\n                rights is\
  \ for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n                noncommercial as permitted\
  \ under Section 4(b) and\n                otherwise waives the right to collect royalties\

  \      iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the\n                right to\
  \ collect royalties, whether individually or, in\n                the event that the Licensor\
  \ is a member of a collecting\n                society that administers voluntary licensing\
  \ schemes, via\n                that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n   \
  \             granted under this License that is for a purpose or use\n                which\
  \ is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under\n                Section 4(b).\n\n  \
  \        j. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as\n          may be\
  \ otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,\n          Distribute or Publicly\
  \ Perform the Work either by itself or as\n          part of any Adaptations or Collections,\
  \ You must not distort,\n          mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation\
  \ to\n          the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's\n          honor\
  \ or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions\n          (e.g. Japan), in which\
  \ any exercise of the right granted in\n          Section 3(b) of this License (the right\
  \ to make Adaptations)\n          would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification\
  \ or\n          other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's\n          honor\
  \ and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as\n          appropriate, this Section,\
  \ to the fullest extent permitted by\n          the applicable national law, to enable You\
  \ to reasonably\n          exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to\n\
  \          make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n          k. Do not make any legal claim\
  \ against anyone accusing the\n          Work, with or without changes, alone or with other\
  \ works,\n          of infringing any patent claim.\n\n5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND\
  \ DISCLAIMER\n\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n\
  \   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n   KIND CONCERNING\
  \ THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\
  \ OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE\
  \ ABSENCE OF\n   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n   ERRORS,\
  \ WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\
  \ WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n   YOU.\n\n6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY\n\n\
  \   EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\n   LICENSOR BE LIABLE\
  \ TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\n   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY\
  \ DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\n   THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN\
  \ ADVISED\n   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. TERMINATION\n\n          a. This License\
  \ and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n          automatically upon any breach\
  \ by You of the terms of this\n          License. Individuals or entities who have received\
  \ Adaptations\n          or Collections from You under this License, however, will not\n \
  \         have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or\n          entities\
  \ remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections\n          1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\
  \ will survive any termination of this\n          License.\n\n          b. Subject to the\
  \ above terms and conditions, the license\n          granted here is perpetual (for the duration\
  \ of the applicable\n          copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor\n\
  \          reserves the right to release the Work under different license\n          terms\
  \ or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,\n          however that any such\
  \ election will not serve to withdraw this\n          License (or any other license that has\
  \ been, or is required to\n          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\
  \ License\n          will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n       \
  \   stated above.\n\n8. REVISED LICENSE VERSIONS\n\n          a. This License may receive\
  \ future revisions in the original\n          spirit of the license intended to strengthen\
  \ This License.\n          Each version of This License has an incrementing version number.\n\
  \n          b. Unless otherwise specified like in Section 8(c) The Licensor\n          has\
  \ only granted this current version of This License for The Work.\n          In this case\
  \ future revisions do not apply.\n\n          c. The Licensor may specify that the latest\
  \ available\n          revision of This License be used for The Work by either explicitly\n\
  \          writing so or by suffixing the License URI with a \"+\" symbol.\n\n          d.\
  \ The Licensor may specify that The Work is also available\n          under the terms of This\
  \ License's current revision as well\n          as specific future revisions. The Licensor\
  \ may do this by\n          writing it explicitly or suffixing the License URI with any\n\
  \          additional version numbers each separated by a comma.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n \
  \         a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n          Collection,\
  \ the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n          the Work on the same terms\
  \ and conditions as the license granted\n          to You under this License.\n\n        \
  \  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\n          Licensor offers\
  \ to the recipient a license to the original Work\n          on the same terms and conditions\
  \ as the license granted to You\n          under this License.\n\n          c. If the Work\
  \ is classified as Software, each time You Distribute\n          or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\
  \ Licensor offers to the recipient\n          a copy and/or URI of the corresponding Source\
  \ Code on the same\n          terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\
  \ License.\n\n          d. If the Work is used as a Web Service, each time You Distribute\n\
  \          or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, or serve data derived from the\n          Software,\
  \ the Licensor offers to any recipients of the data a copy\n          and/or URI of the corresponding\
  \ Source Code on the same terms and\n          conditions as the license granted to You under\
  \ this License.\n\n          e. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n\
  \          under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n          enforceability\
  \ of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n          and without further action by\
  \ the parties to this agreement,\n          such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\
  \ extent necessary\n          to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n          f.\
  \ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived\n          and no breach consented\
  \ to unless such waiver or consent shall\n          be in writing and signed by the party\
  \ to be charged with such\n          waiver or consent.\n\n          g. This License constitutes\
  \ the entire agreement between the\n          parties with respect to the Work licensed here.\
  \ There are no\n          understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n\
  \          the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n          additional\
  \ provisions that may appear in any communication from\n          You. This License may not\
  \ be modified without the mutual written\n          agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n\
  \          h. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced,\n          in this\
  \ License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the\n          Berne Convention for the\
  \ Protection of Literary and Artistic\n          Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),\
  \ the Rome Convention of\n          1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances\n\
  \          and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n          Convention\
  \ (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and\n          subject matter take effect in\
  \ the relevant jurisdiction in which\n          the License terms are sought to be enforced\
  \ according to the\n          corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\n\
  \          provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite\n          of\
  \ rights granted under applicable copyright law includes\n          additional rights not\
  \ granted under this License, such\n          additional rights are deemed to be included\
  \ in the License; this\n          License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights\n\
  \          under applicable law."
