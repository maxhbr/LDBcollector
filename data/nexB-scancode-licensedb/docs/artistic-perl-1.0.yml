text: "             The \"Artistic License\"\n \n                Preamble\n \nThe intent of\
  \ this document is to state the conditions under which a\nPackage may be copied, such that\
  \ the Copyright Holder maintains some\nsemblance of artistic control over the development\
  \ of the package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n\
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\nreasonable modifications.\n\
  \ \nDefinitions:\n \n    \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\n\
  \    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n    created through textual\
  \ modification.\n \n    \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\n\
  \    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n    of the Copyright Holder\
  \ as specified below.\n \n    \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\n\
  \    copyrights for the package.\n \n    \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying\
  \ or distributing\n    this Package.\n \n    \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can\
  \ justify on the\n    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\n\
  \    and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\n    Copyright Holder, but\
  \ only to the computing community at large\n    as a market that must bear the fee.)\n \n\
  \    \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n    itself, though there\
  \ may be fees involved in handling the item.\n    It also means that recipients of the item\
  \ may redistribute it\n    under the same conditions they received it.\n \n1. You may make\
  \ and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package\
  \ without restriction, provided that you\nduplicate all of the original copyright notices\
  \ and associated disclaimers.\n \n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other\
  \ modifications\nderived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n\
  modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n \n3. You may otherwise\
  \ modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\nthat you insert a prominent notice\
  \ in each changed file stating how and\nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you\
  \ do at least ONE of the\nfollowing:\n \n    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain\
  \ or otherwise make them\n    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet\
  \ or\n    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n    site\
  \ such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n    your modifications\
  \ in the Standard Version of the Package.\n \n    b) use the modified Package only within\
  \ your corporation or organization.\n \n    c) rename any non-standard executables so the\
  \ names do not conflict\n    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n\
  \    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n    documents how\
  \ it differs from the Standard Version.\n \n    d) make other distribution arrangements with\
  \ the Copyright Holder.\n \n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code\
  \ or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n \n    a) distribute\
  \ a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n    together with instructions\
  \ (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n    to get the Standard Version.\n \n    b)\
  \ accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n    the Package with your\
  \ modifications.\n \n    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n\
  \    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n    with instructions\
  \ on where to get the Standard Version.\n \n    d) make other distribution arrangements with\
  \ the Copyright Holder.\n \n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution\
  \ of this\nPackage.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\nPackage.  You\
  \ may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\nyou may distribute this Package\
  \ in aggregate with other (possibly\ncommercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)\
  \ software\ndistribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\nproduct of\
  \ your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within\nan executable of yours (by linking);\
  \ this shall be construed as a mere\nform of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard\
  \ Version of the\ninterpreter is so embedded.\n \n6. The scripts and library files supplied\
  \ as input to or produced as\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically\
  \ fall\nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may\
  \ be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library\
  \ files are aggregated with this\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods\
  \ of producing a\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither\
  \ be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions\
  \ of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a\
  \ Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n \n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines\
  \ in other\nlanguages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\nemulate subroutines\
  \ and variables of the language defined by this\nPackage shall not be considered part of this\
  \ Package, but are the\nequivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines\
  \ do\nnot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\nregression tests\
  \ for the language.\n \n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always\n\
  permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,\nwhen no overt attempt\
  \ is made to make this Package's interfaces visible\nto the end user of the commercial distribution.\
  \  Such use shall not be\nconstrued as a distribution of this Package.\n \n9. The name of\
  \ the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\nproducts derived from this software\
  \ without specific prior written permission.\n \n10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND\
  \ WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED\n\
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n \n                The\
  \ End"
