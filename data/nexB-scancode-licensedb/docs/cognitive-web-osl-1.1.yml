  \ (the \"License\") applies to\nCognitiveWeb software products as well as any updates or maintenance\n\
  releases of that software (\"CognitiveWeb Products\") that are distributed\nby CognitiveWeb.\
  \ (\"Licensor\").  Any CognitiveWeb Product licensed\npursuant to this License is a Licensed\
  \ Product.  Licensed Product, in\nits entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law.  This\
  \ License\nidentifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify\nLicensed\
  \ Product.\n\nPreamble\n\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature\
  \ and\nscope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this\nlicense. The legal\
  \ effect of this License is dependent only upon the\nterms of the License and not this Preamble.\
  \ This License complies with\nthe Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source\n\
  Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as\n\"OSI Certified Open\
  \ Source Software.\"\n\nThis License provides that:\n\n1.      You may use, sell or give away\
  \ the Licensed Product, alone or as\na component of an aggregate software distribution containing\
  \ programs\nfrom several different sources.  No royalty or other fee is required.\n\n2.  \
  \    Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed\nProduct, including Modifications\
  \ made by previous Contributors, are\navailable for your use.  (The terms \"Licensed Product,\"\
  \ \"Modifications,\"\n\"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\n\n\
  3.      You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product,\nand you can create\
  \ Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative\nWorks\" is defined in the License.)\n\n\
  4.      By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this\nLicense, you agree\
  \ that any Modifications you make to the Licensed\nProduct and then distribute are governed\
  \ by the provisions of this\nLicense.  In particular, you must make the Source Code of your\n\

  \ patent claims against the Licensor relating to\nthe Licensed Product, or if you breach any\
  \ terms of the License, your\nrights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically\n\
  terminate. You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative\nWorks, in which case\
  \ the provisions of this License will apply to your\nDerivative Works just as they do to the\
  \ original Licensed Product.\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under\
  \ any other\nOSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your\nchoice.\

  \ the requirements of this License (including the\nprovisions relating to publishing the Source\
  \ Code) for those portions of\nyour Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product,\
  \ including\nthe files containing Modifications.\n\nNew versions of this License may be published\
  \ from time to time.  You\nmay choose to continue to use the license terms in this version\
  \ of the\nLicense or those from the new version.  However, only the Licensor has\nthe right\
  \ to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed\nProduct. This License relies\
  \ on precise definitions for certain terms.\nThose terms are defined when they are first used,\
  \ and the definitions\nare repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the\n\
  License.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n1.      Grant of License From Licensor.  Licensor hereby grants\

  Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\n\n2. Grant of License to Modifications\
  \ From Contributor. \"Modifications\"\nmeans any additions to or deletions from the substance\

  \ any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the\nterm \"Licensed Product\"\
  \ shall include all previous Modifications that\nyou receive from any Contributor. By application\
  \ of the provisions in\nSection 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed\
  \ to\nthe creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\")\nhereby grants\

  Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\ngranted separate from\
  \ the Licensed Product, for code that you delete\nfrom the Licensed Product, or for combinations\
  \ of the Licensed Product\nwith other software or hardware.  No right is granted to the trademarks\n\
  of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the\nLicensed Product. \
  \ Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to\nprohibit Licensor from licensing under\
  \ different terms from this License\nany code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\
  \ license.\n\n4.      Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.  \n\na.       Application of\
  \ This License to Your Modifications.  As an\nexpress condition for your use of the Licensed\
  \ Product, you hereby agree\nthat any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute,\
  \ and\nwhich you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License\nincluding, without\
  \ limitation, Section 2.  Any Modifications that you\ncreate or to which you contribute may\
  \ be distributed only under the\nterms of this License or a future version of this License\
  \ released under\nSection 7.  You must include a copy of this License with every copy of\n\
  the Modifications you distribute.  You agree not to offer or impose any\nterms on any Source\
  \ Code or executable version of the Licensed Product\nor Modifications that alter or restrict\
  \ the applicable version of this\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you\
  \ may include an\nadditional document offering the additional rights described in Section\n\
  4(e).\n\nb.       Availability of Source Code.  You must make available, under\nthe terms\
  \ of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and\nany Modifications that you\
  \ distribute, either on the same media as you\ndistribute any executable or other form of\
  \ the Licensed Product, or via\na mechanism generally accepted in the software development\
  \ community for\nthe electronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution\nMechanism\"\
  ).  The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or\nModifications that you distribute\
  \ must remain available for at least\ntwelve (12) months after the date it initially became\
  \ available, or at\nleast six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product\n\
  or Modifications has been made available.  You are responsible for\nensuring that the Source\
  \ Code version remains available even if the\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained\
  \ by a third party.\n\nc.       Description of Modifications.  You must cause any Modifications\n\
  that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to\ncontain a file documenting\
  \ the additions, changes or deletions you made\nto create or contribute to those Modifications,\
  \ and the dates of any\nsuch additions, changes or deletions.  You must include a prominent\n\
  statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly,\nfrom the Licensed Product\
  \ and include the names of the Licensor and any\nContributor to the Licensed Product in (i)\
  \ the Source Code and (ii) in\nany notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you\

  \ the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any\npreexisting copyright notices in\
  \ the Licensed Product.\n\nd.       Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n    i.            Third\
  \ Party Claims.  \nIf you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual\n\
  property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this\nLicense, you must include\
  \ a text file with the Source Code distribution\ntitled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim\
  \ and the party making the claim\nin sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to\
  \ contact.  If you\nobtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as\n\
  described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in\nall copies you make\
  \ available thereafter and shall take other steps\n(such as notifying appropriate mailing\
  \ lists or newsgroups) reasonably\ncalculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product\
  \ from you\nthat new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n    ii.            Contributor APIs.\
  \  If your Modifications include \nan application programming interface (\"API\") and you\
  \ have knowledge of\npatent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\
  \ you\nmust also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n    iii.            Representations.\
  \  You represent that, except as \ndisclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any\
  \ Modifications\nyou distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient\n\
  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\ne.       Required Notices.  You must\
  \ duplicate this License in any\ndocumentation you provide along with the Source Code of any\n\
  Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you\ndistribute, wherever you\
  \ describe recipients' rights relating to\nLicensed Product.  You must duplicate the notice\
  \ contained in Exhibit A\n(the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you\n\
  distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you\nmay add your name\
  \ as a Contributor to the Notice.  If it is not possible\nto put the Notice in a particular\
  \ Source Code file due to its structure,\nthen you must include such Notice in a location\
  \ (such as a relevant\ndirectory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\
  You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability\
  \ obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed\nProduct. However, you may do so only\
  \ on your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of the Licensor or any Contributor.  You must make\
  \ it clear that\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered\n\
  by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every\nContributor for any\
  \ liability incurred by the Licensor or such\nContributor as a result of warranty, support,\
  \ indemnity or liability\nterms you offer.\n\nf.        Distribution of Executable Versions.\
  \  You may distribute\nLicensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice\n\
  that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have\nsatisfied the requirements\
  \ of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that\ndistribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice\
  \ in the executable\nversion, related documentation and collateral materials stating that\
  \ the\nSource Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms\nof this License,\
  \ including a description of how and where you have\nfulfilled the obligations of Section\
  \ 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing\ncopyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv)\
  \ you make it clear\nthat any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone,\n\
  not by Licensor or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the\nLicensor and every\
  \ Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or\nsuch Contributor as a result of any\
  \ terms you offer.\n\ng.       Distribution of Derivative Works.  You may create Derivative\n\
  Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with\nother code) and distribute\
  \ the Derivative Works as products under any\nother license you select, with the proviso that\
  \ the requirements of this\nLicense are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works\
  \ that\nconsist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\n\n5.      Inability\
  \ to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.  If it is\nimpossible for you to comply with any\
  \ of the terms of this License with\nrespect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to\
  \ statute, judicial\norder, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this\n\
  License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or\nregulation that prohibits\
  \ you from adhering to the License, and (iii)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they\
  \ affect. Such description must\nbe included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d),\
  \ and must be\nincluded with all distributions of the Source Code.  Except to the\nextent\
  \ prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for\
  \ a recipient of ordinary skill at computer\nprogramming to be able to understand it.\n\n\
  6.      Application of This License.  This License applies to code to\nwhich Licensor or Contributor\
  \ has attached the Notice in Exhibit A,\nwhich is incorporated herein by this reference.\n\
  \n7.      Versions of This License.\n\na.       New Versions.  Licensor may publish from time\
  \ to time revised\nand/or new versions of the License.\n\nb.       Effect of New Versions.\
  \  Once Licensed Product has been\npublished under a particular version of the License, you\
  \ may always\ncontinue to use it under the terms of that version.  You may also choose\nto\
  \ use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version\nof the License published\
  \ by Licensor.  No one other than Licensor has\nthe right to modify the terms applicable to\
  \ Licensed Product created\nunder this License.\n\nc.       Derivative Works of this License.\
  \  If you create or use a\nmodified version of this License, which you may do only in order\
  \ to\napply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this\nLicense, you\
  \ must rename your license so that it is not confusingly\nsimilar to this License, and must\
  \ make it clear that your license\ncontains terms that differ from this License.  In so naming\
  \ your\nlicense, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n8.     \
  \ Disclaimer of Warranty.  LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS\nLICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,\
  \ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\
  \ WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED\nPRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\
  \ PURPOSE\nOR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE LICENSED\
  \ PRODUCT IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE\nDEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND\
  \ NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\
  \ REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF\nTHIS\
  \ LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT\nUNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
  \n9.      Termination.  \n\na.       Automatic Termination Upon Breach.  This license and\
  \ the rights\ngranted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply\nwith the\
  \ terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30)\ndays of becoming aware of\
  \ the breach.  All sublicenses to the Licensed\nProduct that are properly granted shall survive\
  \ any termination of this\nlicense.  Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect\
  \ beyond\nthe termination of this License, shall survive.\n\nb.       Termination Upon Assertion\
  \ of Patent Infringement.  If you\ninitiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\
  \ claim (excluding\ndeclaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor\n(Licensor\
  \ or Contributor against whom you file such an action is\nreferred to herein as Respondent)\
  \ alleging that Licensed Product\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and\
  \ all rights\ngranted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License\nshall\
  \ terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from\nRespondent (the \"Notice Period\"\
  ) unless within that Notice Period you\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually\
  \ agreeable\nreasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made\nby such\
  \ Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect\nto Licensed Product against\
  \ such Respondent. If within said Notice\nPeriod a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement\
  \ are not mutually\nagreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not\n\
  withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2\nautomatically terminate\
  \ at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\nc.       Reasonable Value of This License. \
  \ If you assert a patent\ninfringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product\n\
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\n(such as by license\
  \ or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable\
  \ value of the licenses\ngranted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken\
  \ into\naccount in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\nd.      \
  \ No Retroactive Effect of Termination.  In the event of\ntermination under Sections 9(a)\
  \ or 9(b) above, all end user license\nagreements (excluding licenses to distributors and\
  \ resellers) that have\nbeen validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to\n\
  termination shall survive termination.\n\n10.  Limitation of Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES\
  \ AND UNDER NO LEGAL\nTHEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,\n\
  SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED\nPRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER\
  \ OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON\nFOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS\
  \ OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL\
  \ DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
  \ DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\
  \ INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH\
  \ LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\nEXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n11.\
  \  Responsibility for Claims.  As between Licensor and Contributors,\neach party is responsible\
  \ for claims and damages arising, directly or\nindirectly, out of its utilization of rights\
  \ under this License.  You\nagree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such\n\
  responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or\nshall be deemed to constitute\
  \ any admission of liability.\n\n12.  U.S. Government End Users.  The Licensed Product is\
  \ a commercial\nitem, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting\n\

  \ are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).\nConsistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.\
  \ 227.7202-1 through\n227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed\n\
  Product with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.  This License represents\
  \ the complete agreement\nconcerning the subject matter hereof.  If any provision of this\
  \ License\nis held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to\nthe extent\
  \ necessary to make it enforceable. Any action or suit relating\nto this License may be brought\
  \ only in the courts of a jurisdiction\nwherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor\
  \ conducts its primary\nbusiness, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its\n\
  conflict-of-law provisions. The losing party is responsible for costs\nincluding, without\
  \ limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees\nand expenses.  You and Licensor expressly\
  \ waive any rights to a jury\ntrial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this\
  \ License.\nAny law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract\nshall be\
  \ construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\nThe application of the United\
  \ Nations Convention on Contracts for the\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\
  \ Any use of the\nOriginal Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination\n\
  shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright\nAct, 17 U.S.C. 101\
