  "text": "This is a package of commutative diagram macros built on top of Xy-pic  by\nMichael Barr (email: barr@barrs.org). Its use is unrestricted. It  may be freely\ndistributed, unchanged, for non-commercial or commercial  use. If changed, it\nmust be renamed. Inclusion in a commercial  software package is also permitted,\nbut I would appreciate receiving a  free copy for my personal examination and\nuse. There are no guarantees  that this package is good for anything. I have\ntested it with LaTeX 2e,  LaTeX 2.09 and Plain TeX. Although I know of no reason\nit will not work  with AMSTeX, I have not tested it."
