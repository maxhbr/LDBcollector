Specifically, the \u201cReuser\u201d may satisfy this condition by pointing, via a hypertext link, to the source of \u201cthe Information\u201d and so supplying an actual acknowledgement of its authorship.\n\n**For example:**\n\n> \u201cMinistry of xxx\u2014Original data downloaded from `http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/xxx/`, updated on 14 February 2017\u201d.\n\nThis acknowledgement of authorship does not confer any official status on the \u201cReuse\u201d of the \u201cInformation\u201d, and must not suggest any sort of recognition or endorsement on the part of the \u201cGrantor\u201d, or any other public entity, of the \u201cReuser\u201d or of their \u201cReuse\u201d.\n\n## Personal data\n\nThe \u201cInformation\u201d made available may contain \u201cPersonal data\u201d that may be subject to \u201cReuse\u201d. If this is the case, the \u201cGrantor\u201d informs the \u201cReuser\u201d about its existence.
