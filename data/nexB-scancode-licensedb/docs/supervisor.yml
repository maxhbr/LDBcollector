  \ and client code is based, was created by Sam\nRushing:\n\n  Medusa was once distributed\
  \ under a 'free for non-commercial use'\n  license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed\
  \ the license to be\n  identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard\n\
  \  Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,\n  this change just\
  \ frees up the rest of the system, including the http\n  server, ftp server, utilities, etc.\
  \  Medusa is therefore under the\n  following license:\n\n  ==============================\
