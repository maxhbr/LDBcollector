But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.\n\nSo, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string for future xinetd\nversions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that\nwould only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the\nconfusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*."
