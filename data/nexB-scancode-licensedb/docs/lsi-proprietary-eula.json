LSI Licensed Code Containing JRE. Certain LSI Licensed Code may contain\nJRE. Use of the JRE is restricted by JRE licensing terms to General Purpose\nDesktop Computers and Servers, as defined below. Licensee may seek its own\nlicense for the JRE directly with the owner, if it deems necessary. \"General\nPurposes Desktop Computers and Servers\" under JRE licensing terms is defined as\n\"computers, including desktop, laptop and tablet computers, or servers, used for\ngeneral computing functions under end user control (such as but not specifically\nlimited to email, general purpose Internet browsing and office suite\nproductivity tools)\".
