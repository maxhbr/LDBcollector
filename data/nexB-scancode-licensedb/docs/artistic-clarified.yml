  \ of this document is to state the conditions under which a\nPackage may be copied, such that\
  \ the Copyright Holder maintains some\nsemblance of artistic control over the development\
  \ of the package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n\
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\nreasonable modifications.\n\
  \ \nDefinitions:\n \n    \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\n\
  \    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n    created through textual\
  \ modification.\n \n    \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\n\
  \    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n    of the Copyright Holder\
  \ as specified below.\n \n    \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\n\
  \    copyrights for the package.\n \n    \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying\
  \ or distributing\n    this Package.\n \n    \"Distribution fee\" is a fee you charge for\
  \ providing a copy\n        of this Package to another party.\n \n    \"Freely Available\"\
  \ means that no fee is charged for the right to\n        use the item, though there may be\
  \ fees involved in handling the\n        item.  It also means that recipients of the item\
  \ may redistribute\n        it under the same conditions they received it.\n \n1. You may\
  \ make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package\
  \ without restriction, provided that you\nduplicate all of the original copyright notices\
  \ and associated disclaimers.\n \n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other\
  \ modifications\nderived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from\n\
  the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be\nconsidered the Standard\
  \ Version.\n \n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n\
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\nwhen you changed\
  \ that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\nfollowing:\n \n    a) place your\
  \ modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n    Freely Available, such as\
  \ by posting said modifications to Usenet or an\n    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications\
  \ on a major network\n    archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing\
  \ the\n    Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version\n    of\
  \ the Package.\n \n    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\
  \ \n    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n    with standard\
  \ executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n    a separate manual page for each\
  \ non-standard executable that clearly\n    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\
  \ \n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n \n    e) permit\
  \ and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package\n       permission to make\
  \ your modifications Freely Available\n       in some specific way.\n \n\n4. You may distribute\
  \ the programs of this Package in object code or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at\
  \ least ONE of the following:\n \n    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables\
  \ and library files,\n    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on\
  \ where\n    to get the Standard Version.\n \n    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable\
  \ source of\n    the Package with your modifications.\n \n    c) give non-standard executables\
  \ non-standard names, and clearly\n    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),\
  \ together\n    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n \n    d) make other\
  \ distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n \n    e) offer the machine-readable\
  \ source of the Package, with your\n       modifications, by mail order.\n \n5. You may charge\
  \ a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package.\nIf you offer support for this\
  \ Package, you may charge any fee you choose\nfor that support.  You may not charge a license\
  \ fee for the right to use\nthis Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in aggregate\
  \ with\nother (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a\nlarger (possibly\
  \ commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution,\nand charge license fees for other\
  \ parts of that software distribution,\nprovided that you do not advertise this Package as\
  \ a product of your own.\nIf the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's\n\
  interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be\nconstrued as a mere\
  \ form of aggregation, provided that the complete\nStandard Version of the interpreter is\
  \ so embedded.\n \n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n\
  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\nunder the copyright of\
  \ this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may\
  \ be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with\
  \ this\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\nbinary\
  \ executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither be construed as a distribution\
  \ of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided\
  \ that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n\
  \ \n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\nlanguages) supplied by\
  \ you and linked into this Package in order to\nemulate subroutines and variables of the language\
  \ defined by this\nPackage shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\nequivalent\
  \ of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\nnot change the language in any\
  \ way that would cause it to fail the\nregression tests for the language.\n \n8. Aggregation\
  \ of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial\ndistribution is always permitted\
  \ provided that the use of this Package\nis embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made\
  \ to make this Package's\ninterfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.\n\
  Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n \n9. The name of the\
  \ Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\nproducts derived from this software\
  \ without specific prior written permission.\n \n10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND\
