  \   Copyright (C) 2003, 2010, 2015 Andras Varga\n\n\n                                Preamble\n\
  \n  This license contains the terms and conditions of using OMNeT++ in\nnoncommercial settings:\
  \ at academic institutions for teaching and research\nuse and for personal or educational\
  \ purposes. You will find that this\nlicense provides noncommercial users of OMNeT++ with\
  \ rights that are\nsimilar to the well-known GNU General Public License, yet it retains the\n\
  possibility for OMNeT++ authors to financially support the development by\nselling commercial\
  \ licenses. In fact, if you intend to use OMNeT++ in a\n\"for-profit\" environment, where\
  \ research is conducted to develop or enhance\na product, is used in a commercial service\
  \ offering, or when an entity uses\nOMNeT++ to participate in government-funded, EU-funded,\
  \ military or similar\nresearch projects, then you need to obtain a commercial license (OMNEST).\n\
  In that case, or if you are unsure, please visit www.omnest.com to inquire about \ncommercial\
  \ licenses.\n\n  What are the rights given to noncommercial users? Similarly to GPL, you\n\
  have the right to use the software, to distribute copies, to receive source\ncode, to change\
  \ the software and distribute your modifications or the\nmodified software. Also similarly\
  \ to the GPL, if you distribute verbatim or\nmodified copies of this software, they must be\
  \ distributed under this\nlicense.\n\n  By modeling the GPL, this license guarantees that\
  \ you're safe when using\nOMNeT++ in your work, for teaching or research. This license guarantees\n\
  that OMNeT++ will remain available free of charge for nonprofit use. You\ncan modify OMNeT++\
  \ to your purposes, and you can also share your modifications.\nEven in the unlikely case\
  \ of the authors abandoning OMNeT++ entirely, this\nlicense permits anyone to continue developing\
  \ it from the last release, and\nto create further releases under this license.\n\n  We believe\
  \ that the combination of noncommercial open-source and commercial\nlicensing will be beneficial\
  \ for the whole user community, because income from\ncommercial licenses will enable faster\
  \ development and a higher level of\nsoftware quality, while further enjoying the informal,\
  \ open communication\nand collaboration channels of open source development.\n\n  The precise\
  \ terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\n  \
  \                       ACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE\n\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING,\
  \ DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. Definitions\n\n  \"Program\" means a copy of OMNeT++,\
  \ which is said to be distributed under\nthis Academic Public License.\n\n  \"Work based on\
  \ the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work\nunder copyright law: that\
  \ is to say, a work containing the Program or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\
  \ and/or translated into\nanother language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without\
  \ limitation\nin the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Using the Program\" means any act of creating\
  \ executables that contain or\ndirectly use libraries that are part of the Program, running\
  \ any of the\ntools that are part of the Program, or creating works based on the Program.\n\
  \nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program\
  \ free of charge for\nnoncommercial purposes, including teaching and academic research at\n\
  universities, colleges and other educational institutions and personal\nnon-profit purposes.\
  \ For using the Program for commercial purposes,\nincluding but not restricted to consulting\
  \ activities, design of commercial\nhardware or software networking products, and joint research\
  \ with a\ncommercial entity, government-funded, EU-funded, military or similar\nresearch projects,\
  \ you have to contact the author. Or you can also visit www.omnest.com\nfor an appropriate\
  \ license. Permission is also granted to use the Program\nfor a reasonably limited period\
  \ of time for the purpose of evaluating its\nusefulness for a particular purpose.\n\n  2.\
  \ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive\
  \ it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\
  \ an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices\
  \ that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients\
  \ of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\n  3. You may modify your\
  \ copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program,\
  \ and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2\nabove,\
  \ provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified\
  \ files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of\
  \ any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n\
  \    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to\
  \ be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\
  \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of\
  \ that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent\
  \ and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections\
  \ as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole\
  \ must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the\n\
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n(If the same, independent\
  \ sections are distributed as part of a package\nthat is otherwise reliant on, or is based\
  \ on the Program, then the\ndistribution of the whole package, including but not restricted\
  \ to the\nindependent section, must be on the unmodified terms of this License,\nregadless\
  \ of who the author of the included sections was.)\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section\
  \ to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent\
  \ is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works\
  \ based or reliant on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based\
  \ on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n\
  storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\
  \n  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 3) in\
  \ object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 2 and 3 above provided that\
  \ you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding\
  \ machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n\
  \    2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany\
  \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for\
  \ a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n\
  \    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under\
  \ the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange;\
  \ or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute\
  \ corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution\
  \ and only if you received\n    the program in object code or executable form with such an\
  \ offer,\n    in accord with Subsection b) above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the\
  \ preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete\
  \ source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated\
  \ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation\
  \ of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not\
  \ include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the\
  \ major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable\
  \ runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable\
  \ or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering\
  \ equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of\
  \ the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with\
  \ the object code.\n\n  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify,\
  \ sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights\
  \ under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n\
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full\
  \ compliance.\n\n  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned\
  \ it.  Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute\nthe Program or its derivative\
  \ works; law prohibits these actions\nif you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying\
  \ or distributing\nthe Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your\nacceptance\
  \ of this License and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying\
  \ the Program or works based on it, to do so.\n\n  7. Each time you redistribute the Program\
  \ (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
  \ the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms\
  \ and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise\
  \ of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\
  \ parties to\nthis License.\n\n  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation\
  \ of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions\
  \ are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the\
  \ conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.\
  \  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute\
  \ the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution\
  \ of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n\
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from\
  \ distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
  \ under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and\
  \ the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\n  9. If the distribution\
  \ and/or use of the Program are restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\
  \ interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay\
  \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that\
  \ distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case,\
  \ this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n\
  \                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  10. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF\
  \ CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\
  \  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE\
  \ THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
  \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
  \ PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
  \  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  11. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON\
  \ IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE\
  \ THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
  \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
  \ INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
  \ BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS),\
  \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
  \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
