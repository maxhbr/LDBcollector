text: "Terms & Privacy \nML KIT Terms of Service\nThe following terms apply to your use of ML\
  \ Kit APIs. These terms incorporate and are subject to the Google APIs Terms of Service.\n\
  \nGeneral Terms\nFor purposes of these terms, machine learning models will be considered related\
  \ software.\n\nML Kit APIs run on-device. When using the ML Kit APIs, you may not reverse\
  \ engineer or attempt to extract the source code or any related software, except to the extent\
  \ that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.\n\nPrivacy\nWhen you use\
  \ ML Kit APIs, processing of the input data (e.g. images, video, text) fully happens on-device,\
  \ and ML Kit does not send that data to Google servers. As a result, you can use our APIs\
  \ for processing data that should not leave the device.\n\nThe ML Kit APIs may contact Google\
  \ servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes, updated models and\
  \ hardware accelerator compatibility information. The ML Kit APIs also send metrics about\
  \ the performance and utilization of the APIs in your app to Google. Google uses this metrics\
  \ data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the APIs, and detect misuse or\
  \ abuse, as further described in our Privacy Policy.\n\nYou are responsible for informing\
  \ users of your app about Google’s processing of ML Kit metrics data as required by applicable\
  \ law.\n\nFor additional details to help support your Google Play and Apple App Store disclosures\
  \ requirements, please refer to:\n\nGoogle Play’s data disclosure requirements\nApple’s App\
  \ Store data disclosure requirements\n\nLast updated 2022-02-22 UTC"
