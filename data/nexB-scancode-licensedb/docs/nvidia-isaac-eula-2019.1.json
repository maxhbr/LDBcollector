Additionally, you agree that you will\n    protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.\n\n    (vi) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected\n    distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of\n    this Agreement, and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to\n    distributed SDK.\n\n1.3 Authorized Users\n\nYou may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your\nsubsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform\nwork on your behalf.\n\nIf you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by\nthe academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.\n\nYou are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your\nauthorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didn\u2019t follow\nthe terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the\nnon-compliance and prevent new occurrences.\n\n1.4 Pre-Release SDK\n\nThe SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release,\nmay not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have\nreduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and\nreliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and\nmaterials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of\ndata, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.\n\nYou may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release\nSDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.\n\nNVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release\nSDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the\navailability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.\n\n1.5 Updates\n\nNVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates\nto this SDK.
