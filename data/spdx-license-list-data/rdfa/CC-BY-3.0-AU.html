                                Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship,
                                the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have

In this clause 4B these parties are referred to as &quot;Attribution Parties&quot;;&#10;&#10;            &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;ii.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the title of the Work (if provided); and&#10;&#10;            &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;iii.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;c.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly identify that changes were made to the Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish&quot;.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;d.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;e.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;f.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4B for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:&#10;&#10;            &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;i.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or&#10;&#10;            &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;ii.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,&#10;&#10;         without their separate, express prior written permission.&#10;&#10;      4C Moral Rights&#10;&#10;      Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4C, &quot;moral rights&quot; means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;5.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;a.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work &quot;as-is&quot; and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise.
