		As a special exception, if other files instantiate generics from this
		unit, or you link this unit with other files to produce an executable,
		this unit does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be
		covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
		however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
		covered by the GNU Public License.
