         <p>
            As a special exception, the authors of <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt> give permission for
            additional uses of the libraries contained in this release of <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt>.
         </p>
         <p>
            The exception is that, if you link a <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt> library with other files
            to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
            resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public
            License. Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on
            account of linking the <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt> library code into it.
         </p>
         <p>
            This exception does not, however, invalidate any other reasons why
            the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public
            License.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you submit changes to <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt> to the maintainers to be included in
            a subsequent release, you agree by submitting the changes that
            those changes may be distributed with this exception intact.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you write modifications of your own for <alt match=".+" name="projectName">SANE</alt>, it is your choice
            whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
            If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
