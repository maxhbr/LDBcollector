      <notes>This exception is closely similar to GNU-compiler-exception but 
         delineates that the library is compiled with a Free Software compiler, 
         which is slightly broader than a GNU compiler.</notes>
   <text>
      <p>
         As a special exception, if you link this library with other
         files, compiled with a Free Software compiler, to produce an
         executable, this library does not by itself cause the resulting
         executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This
         exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
         executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
