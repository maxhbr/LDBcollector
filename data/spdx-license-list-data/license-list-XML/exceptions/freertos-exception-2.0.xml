    <text>
      <p>Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in its original
       release form, or whether in whole or in part, can only be
       distributed by you under the terms of the GNU General Public
       License plus this exception. An independent module is a module
       which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.</p>
      <p>EXCEPTION TEXT:</p>
      <list>
         <item>
            <p>Clause 1</p>
            <p>Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is
           making a combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and
           conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
           combination.</p>
            <p>As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives
           you permission to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that
           communicate with FreeRTOS solely through the FreeRTOS API
           interface, regardless of the license terms of these
           independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
           combined work under terms of your choice, provided that</p>
            <list>
               <item>
               <bullet>+</bullet>
            Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written
           statement that details to the recipient the version of
           FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself to provide the FreeRTOS
           source code (including any modifications you may have made)
           should the recipient request it.
               </item>
               <item>
                   <bullet>+</bullet>
                  The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or
           related product.
               </item>
               <item>
                   <bullet>+</bullet>
                  The independent modules add significant and primary functionality
           to FreeRTOS and do not merely extend the existing
           functionality already present in FreeRTOS.

            <p>Clause 2</p>
            <p>FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative
           purpose, including the publication of any form of run time or
           compile time metric, without the express permission of Real
           Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and
           is intended to ensure information accuracy).</p>
