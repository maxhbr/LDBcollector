        <p>As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
        can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
        software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
        incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
        called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
