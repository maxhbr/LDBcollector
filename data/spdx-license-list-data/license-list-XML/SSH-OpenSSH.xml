        <p>As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
        can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
        software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
        incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
        called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".</p>

        <p>[Tatu continues]</p>

        <p>However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
        copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
        are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
        source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
        and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
        restrictive); see below for details.</p>

        <p>[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
        these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
        have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,</p>

            <item><bullet>-</bullet> DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library</item>
            <item><bullet>-</bullet> GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL</item>
