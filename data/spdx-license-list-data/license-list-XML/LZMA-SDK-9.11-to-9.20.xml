      <notes>
         The license text currently displayed on the 7-zip SDK website is not the same as any of the
         lzma.txt file in the root folders of the .tar.bz SDK distributions (versions 922 and below)
         that are hosted on SourceForge, nor is it the same as the .7z distributions (versions 935 and
         above) which shifted the license text to DOC\lzma-sdk.txt.

         This license applies to versions between 9.11 and 9.20 (inclusive).
