            This file may be freely copied and
            distributed, provided that no changes whatsoever are
            made. All users are asked to help keep the MMIXware files
            consistent and ``uncorrupted,'' identical everywhere in the
            world. Changes are permissible only if the modified file
            is given a new name, different from the names of existing
            files in the MMIXware package, and only if the
            modified file is clearly identified as not being part of
            that package. (The CWEB system has a ``change file'' facility
            by which users can easily make minor alterations without
            modifying the master source files in any way. Everybody
            is supposed to use change files instead of changing the
            files.) The author has tried his best to produce correct and
            useful programs, in order to help promote computer science
            research, but no warranty of any kind should be assumed.
