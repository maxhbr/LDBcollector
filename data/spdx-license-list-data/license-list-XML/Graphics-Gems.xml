               This code repository predates the concept of Open
               Source, and predates most licenses along such
               lines. As such, the official license truly is:
            </p>
         </optional>
         <p>
            EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other
            words, you cannot claim the text of the code as your own and
            resell it. Using the code is permitted in any program, product,
            or library, non-commercial or commercial. Giving credit is
            not required, though is a nice gesture. The code comes as-is,
            and if there are any flaws or problems with any Gems code,
            nobody involved with Gems - authors, editors, publishers, or
            webmasters - are to be held responsible. Basically, don't be a
            jerk, and remember that anything free comes with no guarantee.
