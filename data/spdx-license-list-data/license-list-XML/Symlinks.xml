            My "symlinks" utility pre-dates the "open source licensing"
            fad by a number of years. Just to clarify, this is 100%
            freeware, written entirely by myself. The intent is to use
            it to detect missing/obsolete symlink targets on an installed
            distro, before creating the "gold" (or "final") release discs.
