                            include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not
                            be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence. </item>

                            may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical
                            arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art
                            reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the

                            recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a

                                Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship,
                                the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have
