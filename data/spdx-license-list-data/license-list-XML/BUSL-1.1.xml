      The Business Source License (this document, or the “License”) is not an Open
      Source license. However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made available
      under an Open Source License, as stated in this License.
      This is a paramaterized license. The license parameters are: restrictions on usage,
      a change date, and the open source license that will govern usage of the software
      after the change date.
