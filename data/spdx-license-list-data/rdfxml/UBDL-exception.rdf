          PREAMBLE
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The GNU General Public License provides a legal guarantee that
          software covered by it remains free (in the sense of freedom, not
          price).  It achieves this guarantee by imposing obligations on anyone
          who chooses to distribute the software.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Some of these obligations may be seen as unnecessarily burdensome.  In
          particular, when the source code for the software is already publicly
          and freely available, there is minimal value in imposing upon each
          distributor the obligation to provide the complete source code (or an
          equivalent written offer to provide the complete source code).
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This Licence allows for the distribution of unmodified binaries built
          from publicly available source code, without imposing the obligations
          of the GNU General Public License upon anyone who chooses to
          distribute only the unmodified binaries built from that source code.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The extra permissions granted by this Licence apply only to unmodified
          binaries built from source code which has already been made available
          to the public in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public
          Licence.  Nothing in this Licence allows for the creation of
          closed-source modified versions of the Program.  Any modified versions
          of the Program are subject to the usual terms and conditions of the
          GNU General Public License.

        &lt;p&gt;
          This Licence applies to any Program or other work which contains a
          notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
          under the terms of this Unmodified Binary Distribution Licence.  All
          terms used in the text of this Licence are to be interpreted as they
          are used in version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published

        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you have made this Program available to the public in both source
          code and executable form in accordance with the terms of the GNU
          General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
          either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
          version, then you are hereby granted an additional permission to use,
          copy, and distribute the unmodified executable form of this Program
          (the &amp;quot;Unmodified Binary&amp;quot;) without restriction, including the right to
          permit persons to whom the Unmodified Binary is furnished to do
          likewise, subject to the following conditions:

&lt;li&gt;
          &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
            when started running, the Program must display an announcement which
            includes the details of your existing publication of the Program
            made in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public License.
            For example, the Program could display the URL of the publicly
            available source code from which the Unmodified Binary was built.
