         &lt;p&gt;
            Linking stunnel statically or dynamically with other modules
            is making a combined work based on stunnel. Thus, the terms and
            conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
            combination. &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;In addition, as a special exception, the copyright
            holder of stunnel gives you permission to combine stunnel with free
            software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL
            and with code included in the standard release of OpenSSL under the
            OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged
            license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the
            terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code
            concerned. &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;Note that people who make modified versions of stunnel
            are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
            versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General
            Public License gives permission to release a modified version
            without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to
            release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
