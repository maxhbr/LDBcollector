            Yes, this means that you, your company, your club, and anyone else
            can use this code anywhere you want. You can change it and distribute it
            under the GPL, include it in your commercial product without releasing
            the source code, put it on the web, etc.&lt;br /&gt;

            The only thing you cannot do is remove my copyright message,
            or distribute any source code based on this implementation that does not
            include my copyright message.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
            I appreciate a mention in the documentation or credits,
            but I understand if that is difficult to do.
            I also appreciate it if you tell me where and why you used my code.
         &lt;/p&gt;
