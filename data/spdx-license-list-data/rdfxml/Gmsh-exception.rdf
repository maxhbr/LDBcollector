         The copyright holders of Gmsh give you permission to combine
         Gmsh with code included in the standard release of Netgen (from
         Joachim Sch&amp;quot;oberl), METIS (from George Karypis at the University
         of Minnesota), OpenCASCADE (from Open CASCADE S.A.S) and ParaView
         (from Kitware, Inc.) under their respective licenses. You may
         copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
         GNU GPL for Gmsh and the licenses of the other code concerned,
         provided that you include the source code of that other code
         when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

         Note that people who make modified versions of Gmsh are not
         obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
         versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General
         Public License gives permission to release a modified version
         without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to
         release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
