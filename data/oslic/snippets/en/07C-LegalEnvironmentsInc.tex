\chapter{Open Source Licenses and Their Legal Environments [tbd]}

\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
In this chapter we analyze why to know a license alone is not enough. At the end
you will know that open source licenses are embedded into the legal environment
of a state. And you will know in which sense the German legal environment
predetermines your readings of open source licenses.
