\section{Line of Thought}

\subsection{the analogy of recipes}
First, RMS compares the writing and using of compupter codes with the noting
and using of recipes: He aims at the point that the exchange of recipes is an
internal and intionally included part of the art and the act of
cooking\footcite[cf][156]{Stallman2001a}: \enquote{These are the natural things to
do with functionally usefule recipes.}\footcite[][156]{Stallman2001a}

\begin{quote}
\enquote{So imagine what it would be like if recipes were packaged inside black
boxes. You couldn't see what ingredients they're using, let alone change them,
and imagine if you made a copy for a friend, they would call you a pirate a try
to put you in prison for years.
}\footcite[][157]{Stallman2001a}
\end{quote}

\subsection{The structure of his history}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In the beginning Stallman was \enquote{[\ldots] part of a community
  of programmers who shared software}, e.g. \enquote{[\ldots] any of
  it with anybody} as a \enquote{way of life} defined by
  \enquote{cooperation}\footcite[cf][157]{Stallman2001a}.
  \item In this context Stallman also tells the story of his earliest experience
  with a new spirit of thinking: He mentions the Xerox laser printer
  designed as net net printer which ran into a trap, stopped working and
  disturbed the work of many people\footcite[cf][157]{Stallman2001a}:
  \enquote{The printer jammed and nobody saw. So it stayed jammed for a
  long time}\footcite[][157]{Stallman2001a}. Now Stallman tried to help
  themselves, as he often might had done before: He tried to get the source code
  from Xerox for being able to improve the software of the printer. But that
  software \enquote{[\ldots] that ran that printer was not free
  software}\footcite[][158]{Stallman2001a}. Stallman tried to solve the
  problem by using the short an 'abbreviation'. He contacted one of those who
  had a copy of the misdesigned software and tried to get it from developer
  colleague to developer colleague. But - as RMS tells - he only got the answer,
  that his colleague had promised, not to give a copy to
  aanyone\footcite[cf][158]{Stallman2001a}. Stallman summarizes this promizes
  that \enquote{[\ldots] he had promised to refuse to cooperate with just about
  the entire population of the planet
  earth}\footcite[cf][158]{Stallman2001a} - or in other words: \enquote{he
  had signed a non-disclosure agreement}\footcite[][158]{Stallman2001a}:
  \begin{quote}
  \enquote{ Now, this was my first direct encounter with a non-discloure agreement,
  and it taught me an important lesson - a lesson that' important because most
  programmers never learn it. This was my first encounter with a non-disclosure
  agreement, and I was the victim. I, and my whole lab, were the victims. And the
  lesson it taught me was that non-disclosure agreements have victims
  }\footcite[][158]{Stallman2001a}
  \end{quote}
  Stallmans concluded that he refuses to use a piece of software for which he
  had to sign a non-disclosure agreement\footcite[cf][159]{Stallman2001a}
  \item But RMS' environment had not only changed by the growing of non free
  software, but also by the removal of the PDP-10 by more modern computers which
  was one of the \enquote{calamities} by which his \enquote{[\ldots]
  community was destroyed [\ldots and] ultimately [\ldots] wiped
  out}\footcite[cf][157 (richtige Seite!)]{Stallman2001a}. This change
  \enquote{[\ldots] gave (RMS) a moral dilemma}\footcite[cf][159 (richtige
  Seite!)]{Stallman2001a}: Either he had to accept the situation and had to jump
  into the uncooperative world of signed \enquote{non-discolsure
  agreements}\footcite[cf][159]{Stallman2001a} or he had to find an
  \enquote{alternative}\footcite[cf][160]{Stallman2001a} which was nothing
  else writing a new free operating system, called
  GNU\footcite[cf][161]{Stallman2001a}.
  \item Stallmans tells that he take the word GNU because it \enquote{[\ldots]
  is the funniest word in the English language}, pronounced like 'new' and
  therefore designed for good wordplays, like 'gnu' = new operation
  system\footcite[cf][161]{Stallman2001a}. And he tells, that he filled the
  m,eaning of GNU following the recursive tradition which had been established
  during the 60's and 70s by generating the editor TECO and its derivates like
  'Tint' standing for \enquote{Tint Is Not Teco} and which had been
  transferred to the history of 'Emacs' and his derivations like 'Fine' (
  \enquote{Fine Is Not Emacs} ) until 'MINCE' ( \enquote{Mince Is Not
  Complete Emacs} ) or anything else\footcite[cf][161]{Stallman2001a}
  \item Part of the history of RMS is also that he had quit his Job at MIT in
  1984\footcite[cf][162]{Stallman2001a} and that he had to \enquote{[\ldots]
  to make money through (his) work on free software
  [\ldots]}\footcite[cf][162]{Stallman2001a}. His solution was to sell
  \enquote{tapes} containing the software of \enquote{Emacs} - each for
  a price of 150\$\footcite[cf][162]{Stallman2001a}. Stallman himself
  explecitely says that this a an example for the fact that \enquote{free
  software} is \enquote{[\ldots] referring to freedom, not price}. And
  he add, that it is \enquote{[\ldots] not (his) goal [\ldots] to making
  sure programmers got less money}\footcite[cf][163]{Stallman2001a}
  \item Then RMS defines fewee software in the known sense of the four
  freedoms\footcite[cf][163ff]{Stallman2001a}
  \item And RMS again mentions the difference between the \enquote{open
  source movement} and the \enquote{free software movement}: RMS says,
  that the Open Source movement \enquote{[\ldots] only cite the practical
  benefits}, that they \enquote{[\ldots] deny that people are
  entitled to the freedom to share with their neighbour and to see what
  the program's doing and change it if thex don't like it}. Hen underlines
  that they only \enquote{[\ldots] go to companies and say them, 'You might
  make more money if you let people do this'}. Hence RMS concludes that
  the Open Source movement \enquote{[\ldots] lead people in a similar direction
  [as the Free Software movement do], but for totally different - for
  fundamentallly different philosophical reasons} - he states, that
  \enquote{[\ldots] philosophically, there's a tremendous
  disagreement}\footcite[cf][167]{Stallman2001a}. But on the other hand
  RMS doesn't lack to mention that \enquote{the open source movement has
  contributed substantially to our [free software KR;] community, and we work
  together [with them] on practical
  projects}\footcite[cf][167]{Stallman2001a}
  \item Again RMS tells the story of X Window, which had been developed on the
  MIT and released as free software before the software was overtaken,
  proprietarized more or less little changings and bundled into the unix
  packages of the overtaking companies.\footcite[cf][168f]{Stallman2001a} And
  RMS mentions that this was the reason why he invented 
  \enquote{copyleft}\footcite[cf][169]{Stallman2001a}.
  \item After having reffered the main topics of Copy Left as it known, he make
  an intersting proposition: \enquote{Whenever you distribute[sic!]
  anything that contains any piece of this [copylefted KR;] program, that
  whole program[sic!] must be distributed under these same terms, no
  more, no less}\footcite[cf][169]{Stallman2001a}.
  \item The limits of this last statement are again specified by an explanation
  of X: RMS explicitely describes, that he was happy that X came and he decided
  to use it, although it was not licensed under
  GNU\footcite[cf][171]{Stallman2001a}. [KR: Hence, setting something ontop of a
  copylefted program(lirbary)) requires, that the ontop set program must also be
  published as under the same License, but not the used library X-Window. the
  part]
