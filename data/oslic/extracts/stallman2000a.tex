\ldots The articles emphasizes to talk about 'GNU/Linux' instead of 'Linux'. The
simple name 'Linux' facilitates to combine free and proprietary software so that
in the end the GNU campaign for freedom might have been failed. In the opposite

free software in a specific manner, even to those who don't automatically agree
with that philosophy.

\section{Line of Thought}

The main position of RMS is, that \enquote{if you call our operating system
'Linux', that convey a mistaken idea of the system's origin, history, and
purpose}\footcite[cf][51]{Stallman2000a}. But - so RMS furthermore -
\enquote{if you call ist 'GNU/Linux', that conveys (though not in detail)
an accurate idea}\footcite[cf][51]{Stallman2000a}.

For RMS it's a problem, that \enquote{[\ldots] 'Linux' has been associated
ever since it was first coined with a philosophy that does not make a
commitment to the freedom to cooperate}.
That wouldn't be a problem, \enquote{[\ldots]
if the job werde done and it were time
to relax}\footcite[cf][51]{Stallman2000a}. In this case it would not be
necessary to insist to get the credit. But because there would be still
\enquote{great challanges} - also evoked by the doing of
\enquote{'Linux' distribution companies} - it must be required to name the
system as \enquote{GNU/Linux}\footcite[cf][51]{Stallman2000a}. Or in the
words of RMS \enquote{[\ldots] we need to be recognized for what we have
already done}\footcite[cf][53]{Stallman2000a}

\section{Moral}

For RMS it's clear that \enquote{the GNU Project is idealistic}: It might be
that 'idealism' normally seems to be associated with \enquote{impractical} -
but - so RMS - the GNU \enquote{[\ldots] idealism has been extremely
practical: it is the reason we have a free GNU/Linux operating
system}\footcite[cf][53]{Stallman2000a}.

For the moralic aspect see also the GNU Manifesto: Here RMS declares, that
\enquote{GNU does not eliminate all the world's problems, only some of
them}\footcite[cf][35]{Stallman1984a}. This might be read as an hybris -
but only in a first glance. In fact this sentence is embedded into the
proposition, that for a good support the availibility of the source code
(and the right to modify it) is essential - and hence also for a company, which
want to deliever good support and which will have problems if the source code is
missed as in case of the proprietary programs\footcite[cf][35]{Stallman1984a}.
On the base of this context, Stallman formulates ironicly.
