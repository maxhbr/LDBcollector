    <h2>Version 2, June 1991</h2>

    <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>

    <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

    <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>

    <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
 software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. 
(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU 
Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your 
programs, too.</p>

    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
 you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in 
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

    <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.</p>

    <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the 
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

    <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make 
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this 
free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed 
on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the 
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on 
the original authors' reputations.</p>

    <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>

    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

    <p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>

    <p><strong>0</strong>. This License applies to any program or other 
work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it 
may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The 
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based 
on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under 
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".</p>

    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are 
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

    <p><strong>1</strong>. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
 the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
License along with the Program.</p>

    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a 
fee.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong>. You may modify your copy or copies of the 
Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, 
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

      <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
 in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
 thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties 
under the terms of this License.</p>

      <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands 
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that
 there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and 
that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and 
telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the 
Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an 
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
 announcement.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
 can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
 the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent 
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program.</p>

    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a 
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
 under the scope of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong>. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a
 work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one 
of the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms 
of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or,</p>

      <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable 
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms
 of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or,</p>

      <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the 
offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is 
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
 program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
 with Subsection b above.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work 
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.</p>

    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access 
to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of 
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
 source along with the object code.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong>. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or 
distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. 
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
 License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
 under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as 
such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong>. You are not required to accept this License, 
since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you 
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based 
on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, 
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong>. Each time you redistribute the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the 
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any 
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to this License.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong>. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If 
you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a
 patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would 
be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other circumstances.</p>

    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe 
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
 by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
 the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.</p>

    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong>. If the distribution and/or use of the Program
 is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong>. The Free Software Foundation may publish 
revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it 
and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
 Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong>. If you wish to incorporate parts of the 
Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which
 is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free 
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
 will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all 
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of software generally.</p>

    <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

    <p><strong>11</strong>. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF 
CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
 THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong>. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER 
PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
 BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
 A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.</p>

    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
    <!-- START OF 'HOW TO APPLY' SECTION -->

    <p><strong>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></p>

    <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to 
make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under 
these terms.</p>

    <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is 
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have 
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is 
found.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
       Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>

      <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
 by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
(at your option) any later version.</p>

      <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
 Public License for more details.</p>

      <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public 
License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

    <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show 
w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
 you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>

    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) 
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the 
program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the 
program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James
