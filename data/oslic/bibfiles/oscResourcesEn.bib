This is necessary because in Germany the NO-Warranty clauses of the GPL are not applicable. They are substituted by the rules of 'gifts'. In this sense private authors and distributors are only liable in case of acting deliberately ["vorsätzlich"] or strongly negligently ["grob fahrlässig"]. Additionally commercial distributors must thouroughly check whether a program might damage a customer. But commercial distributors have the full liability for their additionally offered specific services. Beside the 'AGB' character and the typus of GPL as a contract the book refers the idea of Open Source seriously.},

In case of copyleft software the patent must also be given free because of the obligation to publish the changings. And in case of OSS patent clauses all this is done explicitly.},
