  abstract = {Open source software (OSS) has come of age, and a number of maturing
	business models allow OSS companies to make a profit even when their
	product is distributed for free. This article considers the dynamics
	of value creation fuelling the proliferation of OSS and examines
	the business model factors that enable value capture. After interviewing
	leaders from over 20 OSS firms and organisations through early 2006,
	we found that three factors were consistently important in defining
	a vendor's adoption of a given business model: software licence choice,
	which takes into account intellectual property ownership; management
	of developer communities; and the unique features of the markets
	and product categories in which the vendor participates. Considering
	these factors, we characterise seven business models. One striking
	finding is that it is rare to find business-model purity. The majority
	of firms in our sample are pursuing either blended business models
	or multiple models simultaneously.},
