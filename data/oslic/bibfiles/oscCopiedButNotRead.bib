	to take part in free and open source software (FOSS), yet how firms
	participate is largely an unattended research area. Building on information
	from an extensive dataset of secondary sources and 30 in-depth interviews,
	I show that de novo entrants have emerged in conjunction with a changing
	institutional infrastructure and a more pragmatic attitude toward
	firms that focus on technological benefits rather than ideology.
	To understand how these firms try to harness the work of these communities,
	I use the empirical data to derive a 2*2 matrix of different approaches.
	The X axis reflects whether or not the firms initiated a new community
	or relied on communities founded by peers, whereas the Y axis represents
	the degree of participation of the firm in the community. This taxonomy
	illustrates how de novo entrant are initiating new forms of communities
	or joining communities established by peers. This suggests that while
	many of the central pillars of FOSS remains, de novo entrants have
	emerged to find new ways of making business resulting in various
	implications for firm strategies and knowledge disclosure.},

	and protracted political struggles among interested groups. While
	some technologies are inherently political, other technologies become
	politicized through competition among different groups and organizations.
	How do seemingly apolitical technologies become politicized? In this
	article, the author examines the case of the “circuit riders,” a
	progressive technology movement in the United States that promotes
	information technology use among nonprofit and grassroots organizations,
	to show how a particular technology is politicized through field-level
	interactions. Applying and contributing to actor—network theory,
	the author finds that translation takes place as an organizational
	process by which actors associate the ideals of the technology in
	question with their political ideals and then attempt to enroll other
	actors to accept the resultant associations. Successful association
	depends on both discursive and organizational practices.},
