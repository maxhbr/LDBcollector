categories:
  - name: "copyleft-strong"
    description: >-
      Open source license that requires you to license modifications, as well as any code that ends
      up in the same binary (including static linking and module modifications), as well as other
      code that is part of the same work, with the same strong copyleft license.
      Examples: GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, EUPL-1.0, EUPL-1.1, EUPL-1.2.

  - name: "copyleft-LGPL"
    description: >-
      This category is for particular software interaction method defined in the LGPL family of
      licenses, namely LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-3.0. Loosely, if you statically link with an LGPL
      licensed library, you need to provide for the recipient the option to modify the LGPL licensed
      library and thereafter relink with your application. This category is for the LGPL family of
      licenses, namely LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-3.0.

  - name: "copyleft-module-level"
    description: >-
      Open source license that requires you to license modifications made into the same software
      module with the same license as the original open source software module. This also applies,
      if you add code from this module to your own module. Examples: EPL-1.1, CPL-1.0.

  - name: "copyleft-file-level"
    description: >-
      Open source license that requires you to license modifications made into the same file with
      the same license as the original open source file. This also applies, if you add code from
      this file to your own file. Example: MPL-2.0.

  - name: "permissive"
    description: >-
      Open source license that is made available under "non-copyleft" licenses. These generally
      require attribution of the included works and may include other obligations.

  - name: "free-restricted"
    description: >-
      A permissive or open source-style license that contains restrictions regarding the usage of
      the work (for example, where a software is not allowed to be used in nuclear facilities) or
      the redistribution of the software (for example, where commercial redistribution of the
      software is not allowed without express permission). These licenses are not open source
      licenses, since they do not include all the required freedoms.

  - name: "proprietary-free"
    description: >-
      A proprietary-free license may not require a commercial license, but has specific
      terms and conditions which the project is obligated to follow. Some of these terms and
      conditions are provided with or in the code or in clickable downloaded licenses. Examples are
      the Sun Binary Code License Agreement or a freely offered BSP.

  - name: "commercial"
    description: >-
      A license for third-party proprietary content offered under a direct commercial license
      between a supplier and a customer.

  - name: "public-domain"
    description: >-
      A dedication by which a work is placed into the public domain without any explicit
      obligations, but which may have a notice that must be kept with the work per project policy.
      The match maybe to software, code examples on a website, published public domain
      specifications or another type of publication.

  - name: "source-available"
    description: >-
      A source-available license is released through a source code distribution model that
      includes arrangements where the source can be viewed, and in some cases modified, but without
      necessarily meeting the criteria to be called open-source.

  - name: "unstated"
    description: >-
      A statement used when no license is stated, but the content is likely under copyright. Common
      examples include code snippets from publications and websites (such as those from O'Reilly
      Media).

  - name: "irrelevant"
    description: >-
      Category for scanner hits that are irrelevant for compliance purposes.

  - name: "property:network-clause"
    description: >-
      This license has specific terms that apply when the software is used or deployed over a
      network. Few licenses have such terms; examples include Affero GPL, EUPL-1.2 (and other
      versions) OSL and the Common Public Attribution License (CPAL 1.0).

  - name: "property:advertising-clause"
    description: >-
      This license requires a notice in certain advertisements for the product (typically those
      mentioning features of the licensed software) that the licensed software is being used.

  - name: "property:non-commercial"
    description: >-
      Licenses that add a restriction that prevents the use of the software for commercial purposes.

  - name: "property:include-in-notice-file"
    description: >-
      Whether the license includes a notice obligation or similar which can be fulfilled by adding
      the relevant copyright notices and the license text into the project/product notice file.

  - name: "include-in-notice-file"
    description: >-
      Same as above, as a temporary work-around for the category name not being configurable in ORT
      reports, see https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/issues/8220.

  - name: "property:mark-modifications"
    description: >-
      The licence includes an obligation to mark all modifications of licensed content.

  - name: "property:antitivo-clause"
    description: >-
      This property means that the licensee/end user must be offered an opportunity to reinstall
      modified versions of the licensed software on the device and that there must not be any
      controls, such as firmware checking for checksums of the software on device and consequent
      non-operation of the software or device due to the failure of such checks, unless the
      licensee/end user is given adequate information to bypass such controls. This property only
      applies to (i) products normally used for personal, family or household purposes (interpreted
      broadly), and (ii) products designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. Known
      instances in GPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0.

  - name: "property:nuclear-restriction"
    description: >-
      This property denies the use of the software in a nuclear facility.

  - name: "property:patent-clause"
    description: >-
      This property indicates that the license has patent licensing related terms. All patent
      related provisions in a license, with the exception of a basic patent license, trigger this
      clause. For example Apache-2.0 license includes a license cancellation clause due to patent
      disputes.

  - name: "property:distribute-source-code"
    description: >-
      This property indicates that the license requires that the source code of the OSS is either
      distributed, or offered to distribute, in connection with the software delivery.

  - name: "property:modification-related-obligations"
    description: >-
      This property indicates that the license contains obligations that are triggered by modifying
      the licensed content. The scope of obligations could vary, but typically it is about somehow
      making sure that the recipients of the modified content don't attribute the modifications to
      the wrong author and/or that the unmodified content is available to the recipients. The
      obligations go beoynd of mere marking of the modifications. Artistic-type licenses have this
      property, but also some others.

  - name: "property:AutoConf-or-other-exception"
    description: >-
      This property indicates that the license includes an AutoConf exception or another type of
      exception to the license terms. These exceptions vary in terms: some exceptions render the
      license, assuming the exception criteria applies, permissive-style. Other exceptions do not
      render the license permissive style, but rather somehow otherwise relax the terms of the
      license, for example by introducing a list of compatible copyleft-licenses.

  - name: "property:unclear-scanner-finding"
    description: >-
      This property indicates that the scanner finding requires manual conclusion.

  - name: "property:unchecked"
    description: >-
      This property marking means that the properties of the license have not been checked. Ask for
      license categorization/checking. This typically is an uncommon license, which has not yet been
      fully categorized.

  - name: "property:specification-license"
    description: >-
      An open source-style license that is typically applied to specification files and has some
      important limitations, such as a prohibition on modifying the licensed work. These licenses
      usually fall in the free-restricted category. This property enables users an option to
      automatically accept specification licenses, even if free-restricted licenses otherwise
      create rule violations.

  - name: "property:creativecommons"
    description: >-
      Licenses and dedications published and maintained by the Creative Commons. These
      often apply to content that is not software, while sometimes also software is licensed
      under these licenses.

  - name: "property:no-modifications"
    description: >-
      Licenses with this property prohibit the making of modifications to the licensed content.
      This is initially applied to Creative Commons licenses but will be used more widely as
      license reviews progress. Contributions/pull requests are welcome.
