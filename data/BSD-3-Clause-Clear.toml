This license does not meet Fedora's current standards because of its patent language.

There is kernel usage exception to cover certain kernel space uses.
Fedora cannot grant any exceptions to the prohibition on BSD-3-Clause-Clear for userspace packages.

Existing uses of BSD-3-Clause-Clear in the ath11k and ath12k wireless
drivers in the Fedora kernel package (and minor modifications to those uses in
those drivers) are acceptable despite not being open source and, in principle,
conflicting with GPL version 2.
