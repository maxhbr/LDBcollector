notes = '''
The "Proprietary software companies" text in the preamble is a field of use
restriction.  note, DejaCode has 0.93 but calls it an exception. Neither that
version nor this one is an exception to GPL, but the license is "based on" GPL.
I did not check if what DejaCode has and this link are the same (they look like
it), but the short name in DejaCode uses "exception" and that is wrong
