not found in Fedora currently, don't add to SPDX  The text at the given URL is
not really the license it self, more an explanatory text mentionning public
domain dedication and the actual license. On a side note, they seem to define a
theshold for copyrightability at "a dozen of lines" "PM: Reject (not a license,
but rather an explanation of how SLIB is licensed on file by file basis) DC:
Reject (agree with PM) "
