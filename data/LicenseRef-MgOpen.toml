This is a variant of the Bitstream Vera font license. It has a few minor
changes, specifically, the Bitstream Vera license included a note at the end,
after the ALL CAPS section, about the use of certain names in advertising which
the MgOpen license does not have, and the MgOpen license includes one additional
phrase in the third paragraph:    "or if the modifications are accepted for
inclusion in the Font   Software itself by the each appointed Administrator."
