      <h3>Upstream</h3>

      <p>
        All the files in upstream/ are verbatim versions of licenses or
        license metadata, obtained directly from their publishers and
        included without modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of these licenses are not explicit about the terms which
        apply to the license text itself.  Our belief is that there is
        at least an implicit permission which allows distribution of
        verbatim copies of these licenses and their associated metadata.
