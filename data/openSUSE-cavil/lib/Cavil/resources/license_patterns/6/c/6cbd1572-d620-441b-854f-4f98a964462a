TERMINATION\n\n     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,\n     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\n     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the\n     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from\n     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days\n     after your receipt of the notice.\n\n     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate\n     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you\n     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not\n     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the\n     same material does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of\n     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n     <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/>.\n\n     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version\n     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered\n     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you\n     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n     that specified version or of any later version that has been\n     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the\n     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free\n     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can\n     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that\n     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n\n  11. RELICENSING\n\n     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any\n     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\n     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\n     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.\n     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the\n     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC\n     site.\n\n     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\n     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit\n     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\n     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\n     published by that same organization.\n\n     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or\n     in part, as part of another Document.\n\n     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this\n     License, and if all works that were first published under this\n     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently\n     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover\n     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior\n     to November 1, 2008.\n\n     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the\n     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,\n     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6cbd1572-d620-441b-854f-4f98a964462a"}
