It also counts\n     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the\n     version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n--------\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses\nare intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free\nSoftware Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use\nit too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this\nlicense or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\nuse in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these\nthings.\n\n   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n\n   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that\nwhat they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is\nquite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this\nlicense for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n   We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes _Less_ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free\nsoftware.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\nprograms enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating\nsystem, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\n\n   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that\nprogram using a modified version of the Library.\n\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the\n     terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this\n     License\").  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n     A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n     The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n     which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n     Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,\n     translation is included without limitation in the term\n     \"modification\".)\n\n     \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code\n     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n     control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act\n     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and\n     output from such a program is covered only if its contents\n     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of\n     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true\n     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses\n     the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\n     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep\n     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\n     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License\n     along with the Library.\n\n     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\n     for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or\n          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that\n          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the\n          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort\n          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply\n          such function or table, the facility still operates, and\n          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots\n          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n          application-supplied function or table used by this function\n          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the\n          square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\n     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\n     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\n     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\n     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of\n     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\n     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each\n     and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\n     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\n     derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\n     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on\n     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\n     other work under the scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\n     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\n     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\n     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer\n     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\n     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you\n     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to\n     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n     the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable\n     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you\n     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\n     interchange.\n\n     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being\n     compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\n     Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of\n     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n     However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because\n     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that\n     uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this\n     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such\n     executables.\n\n     When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header\n     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may\n     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is\n     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work\n     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a\n     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely\n     defined by law.\n\n     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a\n     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus\n     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section\n     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6c275765-c08f-4ae1-bd21-c574b33524ca"}
