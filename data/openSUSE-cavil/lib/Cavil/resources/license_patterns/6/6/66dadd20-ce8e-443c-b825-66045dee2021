INTRODUCTION\n===============\n\nWelcome to SMPlayer _VERSION_ _BUILD_ for OS\/2 and eComStation.\n\nSMPlayer is a GUI front-end for MPlayer, a command-line movie player that is\navailable for many systems and supports a wide range of formats and codecs,\neither natively or via Win32 DLL codecs. For instance, you can watch VideoCD,\nSVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3\/4\/5, WMV, and even H.264 movies.\n\nSMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic features\nlike playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like support for\nMPlayer filters and more.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of SMPlayer: it remembers the settings of\nall files you play. So you start to watch a movie but you have to leave...\ndon't worry, when you open that movie again it will resume at the same point\nyou left it, and with the same settings: audio track, subtitles, volume...\n\nOther additional interesting features:\n\n  * Configurable subtitles. You can choose font and size, and even colors for\n    the subtitles.\n  * Audio track switching. You can choose the audio track you want to listen.\n    Works with avi and mkv. And of course with DVDs.\n  * Seeking by mouse wheel. You can use your mouse wheel to go forward or\n    backward in the video.\n  * Video equalizer, allows you to adjust the brightness, contrast, hue,\n    saturation and gamma of the video image.\n  * Multiple speed playback. You can play at 2X, 4X... and even in slow motion.\n  * Filters. Several filters are available: deinterlace, postprocessing,\n    denoise... and even a karaoke filter (voice removal).\n  * Audio and subtitles delay adjustment. Allows you to sync audio and\n    subtitles.\n  * Advanced options, such as selecting a demuxer or video & audio codecs.\n  * Playlist. Allows you to enqueue several files to be played one after each\n    other. Autorepeat and shuffle supported too.\n  * Preferences dialog. You can easily configure every option of SMPlayer by\n    using a nice preferences dialog.\n  * Possibility to search automatically for subtitles in opensubtitles.org.\n  * Translations: currently SMPlayer is translated into more than 20 languages,\n    including Spanish, German, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese....\n  * It's multiplatform.
