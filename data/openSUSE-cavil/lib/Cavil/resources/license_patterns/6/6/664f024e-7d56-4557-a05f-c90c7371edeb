There were no other\nchanges to the license.  So, for example, wherever the license for\nPython 2.3 said \"Python 2.3\", the new license says \"Python\".  The\nintent is to make it possible to refer to the PSF license in a more\ndurable way.  For example, some people say they're confused by that\nthe Open Source Initiative's entry for the Python Software Foundation\nLicense::\n\n      http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/PythonSoftFoundation.php\n\nsays \"Python 2.1.1\" all over it, wondering whether it applies only\nto Python 2.1.1.\n\nThe official name of the new license is the Python Software Foundation\nLicense Version 2.\n\nCore and builtins\n-----------------\n\n- Bug #1055820 Cyclic garbage collection was not protecting against that\n  calling a live weakref to a piece of cyclic trash could resurrect an\n  insane mutation of the trash if any Python code ran during gc (via\n  running a dead object's __del__ method, running another callback on a\n  weakref to a dead object, or via any Python code run in any other thread\n  that managed to obtain the GIL while a __del__ or callback was running\n  in the thread doing gc).  The most likely symptom was \"impossible\"\n  ``AttributeError`` exceptions, appearing seemingly at random, on weakly\n  referenced objects.  The cure was to clear all weakrefs to unreachable\n  objects before allowing any callbacks to run.\n\n- Bug #1054139 _PyString_Resize() now invalidates its cached hash value.\n\nExtension Modules\n-----------------\n\n- Bug #1048870:  the compiler now generates distinct code objects for\n  functions with identical bodies.  This was producing confusing\n  traceback messages which pointed to the function where the code\n  object was first defined rather than the function being executed.\n\nLibrary\n-------\n\n- Patch #1056967 changes the semantics of Template.safe_substitute() so that\n  no ValueError is raised on an 'invalid' match group.  Now the delimiter is\n  returned.\n\n- Bug #1052503 pdb.runcall() was not passing along keyword arguments.\n\n- Bug #902037: XML.sax.saxutils.prepare_input_source() now combines relative\n  paths with a base path before checking os.path.isfile().\n\n- The whichdb module can now be run from the command line.\n\n- Bug #1045381: time.strptime() can now infer the date using %U or %W (week of\n  the year) when the day of the week and year are also specified.\n\n- Bug #1048816: fix bug in Ctrl-K at start of line in curses.textpad.Textbox\n\n- Bug #1017553: fix bug in tarfile.filemode()\n\n- Patch #737473: fix bug that old source code is shown in tracebacks even if\n  the source code is updated and reloaded","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"664f024e-7d56-4557-a05f-c90c7371edeb"}
