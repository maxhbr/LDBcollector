To do this,\nadd their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\nother section titles.\nYou may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by\nvarious parties–for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\ndefinition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text,\nto the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover\nText may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for\nthe same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not\nadd another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for\nor to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5.

If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each\nsuch section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\nknown, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license\nnotice of the combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\nentitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\". You\nmust delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n6.
