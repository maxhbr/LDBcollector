Licensing                 \n------------\n\nThe bulk of this library is licensed under the MPL (Mozilla Public License)\nversion 1.0. In simple terms this license allows you to use the library for \nany purpose, commercial or otherwise, provided the library is kept in tact\nas a separate entity and any changes made to the library are made publicly\navailable under the same (MPL) license. It is important to realise that that \nrefers to changes to the library and not your application that is merely \nlinked to the library.\n\nNote that due to a restriction in the GPL, any application you write that \nuses anything another than GPL, eg our library with MPL, is technically in\nbreach of the GPL license. However, it should be noted that MPL does not\ncare about the license of the final application, and as only the author of\nthe GPL application is in breach of his own license and is unlikely to sue\nthemselves for that breach, in practice there is no problem with a GPL \napplication using an MPL or any other commercial library","risk":4,"spdx":"MPL-1.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"61f714c9-cfbd-4edf-835b-eb29a18de5c1"}
