{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL Unspecified","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\nfor this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that\nwhat they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies\ndistributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into\nproprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use\nor not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed\nfor utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.\nThis license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it\nis the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make\nbetween modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the\nlibrary, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application\nprogram. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original\nlibrary, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively\npromote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might\npromote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the\nfree status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of\nnon-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but\nwe have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to\nfaster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the\ndifference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special\none.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called\n\"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\napplication programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work\nbased on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete\nsource code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus\nthe scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its\nscope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only\nif its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\nit). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium,\nprovided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\nof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute\na copy of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\nin exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library,\nand copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\nof these conditions:\n\n a. The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\n    change.\n\n c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n    License.\n\n d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application\n    program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6ffe135f-0ca3-483b-83c2-c88f0680ad14"}
