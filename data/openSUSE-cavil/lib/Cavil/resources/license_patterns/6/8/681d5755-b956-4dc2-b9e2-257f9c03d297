HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language\ncalled ABC. Guido is Python's principal author, although it includes many\ncontributions from others. The last version released from CWI was Python 1.2.\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National\nResearch Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia where he released several\nversions of the software. Python 1.6 was the last of the versions released by\nCNRI. In 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com\nto form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. Python 2.0 was the first and only release\nfrom BeOpen.com.\n\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left CNRI to\nwork with commercial software developers, it became clear that the ability to\nuse Python with software available under the GNU Public License (GPL) was very\ndesirable. CNRI and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop\nenabling wording changes to the Python license. Python 1.6.1 is essentially the\nsame as Python 1.6, with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license\nthat enables later versions to be GPL-compatible. Python 2.1 is a derivative\nwork of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\n\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other\nPythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations. All intellectual property added\nfrom this point on, starting with Python 2.1 and its alpha and beta releases,\nis owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after\nthe Apache Software Foundation.
