Note that the only notable legacy non-LGPL file \r\nwas the old alsa output that didn't work with alsa 0.9\/1.0 anymore.\r\nAlso, there has been a libao output in the betas 0.60 for a short period. Libao being generally problematic for us because \r\nof its GPL license, this output is not distributed anymore in the release packages. There is now a new, LGPLed alsa \r\noutput that made both the old alsa and libao obsolete for our purposes.\r\nSo, the distributed mpg123 releases actually only contain LGPL code, but you get the other files from our subversion \r\nrepository if you checkout the trunk \/ version tags.\r\n\r\nThere has been quite some confusion about the licensing and \"freeness\" of mpg123 in the past.\r\nThe initial \"free for private use, ask me when you want to do something commercial\" license caused some people to avoid \r\nmpg123 and even to write a replacement mimicking the interface but using a different decoding engine - what was not \r\nactively developed for too long but entered the \"free\" software sections.\r\n\r\nThe Debian (non-free section) and Gentoo distributions cared about the last stable and the last development release \r\nof mpg123 over the years with mainly applying security fixes. Thanks go to the distribution maintainers for not letting \r\nit alone to bitrot over the years.\r\n\r\nThomas Orgis started to hack on mpg123 in 2004 while working on his personal audio experience with mixplayd and later \r\nDerMixD, utilizing the generic control interface. In Feb 2005, he crammed control interface improvements together with \r\nDebian's r19 fixes and released the personal fork\/patch named mpg123-thor.\r\nLittle later that year, Nicholas J. Humphrey independently created the sourceforge project and released an autotooled \r\n0.59r under official GPL flag with Debian and MacOSX fixes","risk":2,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"7155670c-a110-4755-989f-7958dc776a97"}
