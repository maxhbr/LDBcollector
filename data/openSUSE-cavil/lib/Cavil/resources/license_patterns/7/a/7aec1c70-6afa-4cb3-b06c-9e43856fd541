We show that, by choosing the appropriate performance, it is indeed possible to share an arbitrary unknown two-qubit state using partially entangled states if the parties collaborate. We then sketch the generation of the three-party scheme to N-party case.  $SKIP19 All rights reserved","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"7aec1c70-6afa-4cb3-b06c-9e43856fd541"}
