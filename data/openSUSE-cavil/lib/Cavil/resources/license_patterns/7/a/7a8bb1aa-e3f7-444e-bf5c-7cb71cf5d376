It also counts\r\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\n the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\r\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\r\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\r\nsoftware is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\r\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\r\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\r\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\r\nbased on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\r\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\r\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\r\nwish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can\r\nchange the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are\r\ninformed that you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors\r\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These\r\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\r\ncopies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\r\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must\r\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other\r\ncode with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\r\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes\r\nto the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,\r\nand (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\r\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else\r\nand passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the\r\noriginal version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected\r\nby problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\r\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\r\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent\r\nholder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\r\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\r\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\r\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the\r\nordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in\r\norder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\r\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\r\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License\r\ntherefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria\r\nof freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for\r\nlinking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\r\nto protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\r\nprovides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\r\nnon-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\r\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\r\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto\r\nstandard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the\r\nlibrary. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as\r\nwidely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by\r\nlimiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General\r\nPublic License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\r\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\r\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\r\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\r\nGNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\r\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\r\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a\r\nmodified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\r\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\r\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\r\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\r\nto run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\r\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\r\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General\r\nPublic License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\r\n\"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as\r\nto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\r\nfunctions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has\r\nbeen distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either\r\nthe Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\r\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\r\nmodifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language.\r\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\r\n\"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\r\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\r\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\r\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using\r\nthe Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only\r\nif its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use\r\nof the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what\r\nthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\r\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\r\nand to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along\r\nwith the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\r\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\r\nforming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\r\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\r\nthese conditions:\r\n\r\n      * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\n      * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent\r\n           notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\r\n           change.\r\n\r\n\r\n      * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n           charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n      * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a\r\n           function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\r\n           that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the\r\n           facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to\r\n           ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such\r\n           function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\r\n           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots\r\n      has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n      application-supplied function or table used by this function must be\r\n      optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root\r\n      function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\n      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\n      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\n      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\r\n      contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\r\n      intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\r\n      derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\n      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\r\n      Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a\r\n      volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\r\n      work under the scope of this License. \r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\r\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\r\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If\r\na newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\r\nappeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make\r\nany other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\r\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\r\nderivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library\r\ninto a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\r\n1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\r\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\r\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\r\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\r\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\r\ncode.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\r\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is\r\ncalled a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a\r\nderivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\r\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of\r\nthe Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\r\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\r\nsuch executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is\r\npart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of\r\nthe Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is\r\nespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the\r\nwork is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely\r\ndefined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts\r\nand accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less\r\nin length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of\r\nwhether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\r\ncode plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\r\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables\r\ncontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked\r\ndirectly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work\r\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions\r\nof the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided\r\nthat the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and\r\nreverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\r\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\r\nmust supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays\r\ncopyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among\r\nthem, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.\r\nAlso, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\n      * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n           machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n           changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n           Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n           with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses\r\n           the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user\r\n           can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n           executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\r\n           the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n           Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to\r\n           use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\n      * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with\r\n           the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\n           copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\n           rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\n           will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\r\n           user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\n           interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n\r\n      * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n           least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\r\n           Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\r\n           performing this distribution.\r\n\r\n      * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\r\n           copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the\r\n           above specified materials from the same place.\r\n\r\n      * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n           materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. \r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\r\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\r\nfrom it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need\r\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\r\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\nthe executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\r\nother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\r\nsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\r\ntogether in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\r\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\r\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\r\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\r\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n      * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same\r\n           work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n           facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections\r\n           above.\r\n\r\n      * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the\r\n           fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n           where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. \r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\r\nmodify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who\r\nhave received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\r\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\r\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library\r\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\r\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or\r\nany work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\r\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\r\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\r\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\r\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\r\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\r\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\r\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\r\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\r\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\r\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\r\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.\r\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\r\nof the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\r\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and\r\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\r\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\r\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\r\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many\r\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\r\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\r\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\r\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\r\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit\r\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\r\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\r\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\r\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\r\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\r\nnew problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\r\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\r\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If\r\nthe Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any\r\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\r\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\r\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions\r\nfor this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\r\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\r\nreuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\r\nTHE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\r\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\r\nLIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\r\nPERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\r\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\r\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\r\nLIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\r\nINABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\r\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\r\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"7a8bb1aa-e3f7-444e-bf5c-7cb71cf5d376"}
