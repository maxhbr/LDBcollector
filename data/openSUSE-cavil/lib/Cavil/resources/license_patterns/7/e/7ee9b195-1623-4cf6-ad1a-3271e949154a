To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant\n    Sections in the Modified Version&#x2019;s license notice. These titles\n    must be distinct from any other section titles.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it\n    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n    parties &#8212; for example, statements of peer review or that the text\n    has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n    standard.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text\n    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made\n    by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the\n    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same\n    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\n    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher\n    that added the old one.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n    permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n    endorsement of any Modified Version.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section5\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections\n    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as\n    Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that\n    you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n    identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there\n    are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,\n    make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n    parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section\n    if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n    combined work.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n    &#8220;History&#8221; in the various original documents, forming one\n    section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections\n    Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections Entitled\n    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;. You must delete all sections Entitled\n    &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section6\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\n    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\n    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\n    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\n    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other\n    respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section7\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n    independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n    distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright\n    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of\n    the compilation&#x2019;s users beyond what the individual works\n    permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does\n    not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\n    derivative works of the Document.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies\n    of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n    aggregate, the Document&#x2019;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that\n    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of\n    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear\n    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section8\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    8. TRANSLATION\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n    translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n    Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\n    their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\n    Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant\n    Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\n    license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided\n    that you also include the original English version of this License and the\n    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a\n    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this\n    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,\n    &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement\n    (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\n    changing the actual title.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section9\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    9. TERMINATION\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\n    modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically\n    terminate your rights under this License.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\n    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless\n    and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\n    license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you\n    of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the\n    cessation.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\n    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\n    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\n    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and\n    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this\n    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not\n    give you any rights to use it.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section10\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n    Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\n    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n    address new problems or concerns. See\n    <ulink url=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/\">Copyleft<\/ulink>.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <simpara>\n    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If\n    the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License\n    &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of\n    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of\n    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free\n    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of\n    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\n    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy\n    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that\n    proxy&#x2019;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n    authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n  <\/simpara>\n  <bridgehead id=\"section11\" renderas=\"sect2\">\n    11. RELICENSING\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <simpara>\n    &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC\n    Site&#8221;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\n    works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those\n    works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a\n    server.
