It also provides other free software developers Less\n\n84      \n\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n\n85      \n\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n\n86      \n\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n\n87      \n\nspecial circumstances.\n\n88      \n\n89      \n\n For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n\n90      \n\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n\n91      \n\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n\n92      \n\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n\n93      \n\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n\n94      \n\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n\n95      \n\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n96      \n\n97      \n\n In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n\n98      \n\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n\n99      \n\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n\n100         \n\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n\n101         \n\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n\n102         \n\nsystem.\n\n103         \n\n104         \n\n Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n\n105         \n\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n\n106         \n\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n\n107         \n\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n108         \n\n109         \n\n The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\n110         \n\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\n111         \n\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n\n112         \n\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n\n113","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"7e164738-2379-42a8-a6b9-303964a28c31"}
