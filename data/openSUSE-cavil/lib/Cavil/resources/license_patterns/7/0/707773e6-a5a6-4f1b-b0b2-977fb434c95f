Gmsh is not in the public domain; it is\r\ncopyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution, but these\r\nrestrictions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating\r\ncitizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others\r\nfrom further sharing any version of Gmsh that they might get from you.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away\r\ncopies of Gmsh, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want\r\nit, that you can change Gmsh or use pieces of Gmsh in new free programs,\r\nand that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive\r\nanyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies of\r\nGmsh, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\r\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\r\ntell them their rights.\r\n\r\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out\r\nthat there is no warranty for Gmsh.  If Gmsh is modified by someone else\r\nand passed on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not\r\nwhat we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not\r\nreflect on our reputation.\r\n\r\nThe precise conditions of the license for Gmsh are found in the General\r\nPublic License that accompanies the source code (@pxref{License}).

Detailed copyright\r\ninformation can be found in @ref{Copyright and credits}.\r\n\r\nIf you want to integrate parts of Gmsh into a closed-source software, or\r\nwant to sell a modified closed-source version of Gmsh, you will need to\r\nobtain a different license.
