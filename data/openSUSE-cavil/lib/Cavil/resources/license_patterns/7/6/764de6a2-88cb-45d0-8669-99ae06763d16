{"export_restricted":0,"license":"OFL-1.1","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"1  ABOUT USING AND DISTRIBUTING FONTS LICENSED UNDER THE OFL\r\n\r\n1.1  Can I use the fonts in any publication, even embedded in the file?\r\nYes. You may use them like most other fonts, but unlike some fonts you may include an embedded subset of the fonts in \r\nyour document. Such use does not require you to include this license or other files (listed in OFL condition 2), nor \r\ndoes it require any type of acknowledgement within the publication. Some mention of the font name within the publication \r\ninformation (such as in a colophon) is usually appreciated. If you wish to include the complete font as a separate file, \r\nyou should distribute the full font package, including all existing acknowledgements, and comply with the OFL conditions. \r\nOf course, referencing or embedding an OFL font in any document does not change the license of the document itself. \r\nThe requirement for fonts to remain under the OFL does not apply to any document created using the fonts and their derivatives. \r\nSimilarly, creating any kind of graphic using a font under OFL does not make the resulting artwork subject to the OFL.\r\n\r\n1.2  Can I make web pages using these fonts?\r\nYes! Go ahead! Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is recommended.\r\n\r\n1.3  Can I make the fonts available to others from my web site?\r\nYes, as long as you meet the conditions of the license (do not sell by itself, include the necessary files, rename Modified \r\nVersions, do not abuse the Author(s)' name(s) and do not sublicense).\r\n\r\n1.4  Can the fonts be included with Free\/Libre and Open Source Software collections such as GNU\/Linux and BSD distributions?\r\nYes! Fonts licensed under the OFL can be freely aggregated with software under FLOSS (Free\/Libre and Open Source Software) \r\nlicenses. Since fonts are much more useful aggregated to than merged with existing software, possible incompatibility \r\nwith existing software licenses is not a problem. You can also repackage the fonts and the accompanying components in \r\na .rpm or .deb package and include them in distro CD\/DVDs and online repositories.\r\n\r\n1.5  I want to distribute the fonts with my program. Does this mean my program also has to be free and open source software?\r\nNo. Only the portions based on the font software are required to be released under the OFL. The intent of the license \r\nis to allow aggregation or bundling with software under restricted licensing as well.\r\n\r\n1.6  Can I include the fonts on a CD of freeware or commercial fonts?\r\nYes, as long some other font or software is also on the disk, so the OFL font is not sold by itself.\r\n\r\n1.7  Can I sell a software package that includes these fonts?\r\nYes, you can do this with both the Original Version and a Modified Version. Examples of bundling made possible by the \r\nOFL would include: word processors, design and publishing applications, training and educational software, edutainment \r\nsoftware, etc.\r\n\r\n1.8  Why won't the OFL let me sell the fonts alone?\r\nThe intent is to keep people from making money by simply redistributing the fonts. The only people who ought to profit \r\ndirectly from the fonts should be the original authors, and those authors have kindly given up potential direct income \r\nto distribute their fonts under the OFL. Please honor and respect their contribution!\r\n\r\n1.9  I've come across a font released under the OFL. How can I easily get more information about the Original Version? \r\nHow can I know where it stands compared to the Original Version or other Modified Versions?\r\nConsult the copyright statement(s) in the license for ways to contact the original authors. Consult the FONTLOG for \r\ninformation on how the font differs from the Original Version, and get in touch with the various contributors via the \r\ninformation in the acknowledgment section. Please consider using the Original Versions of the fonts whenever possible.\r\n\r\n1.10  What do you mean in condition 4? Can you provide examples of abusive promotion \/ endorsement \/ advertisement vs. \r\nnormal acknowledgement?\r\nThe intent is that the goodwill and reputation of the author(s) should not be used in a way that makes it sound like \r\nthe original author(s) endorse or approve of a specific Modified Version or software bundle. For example, it would not \r\nbe right to advertise a word processor by naming the author(s) in a listing of software features, or to promote a Modified \r\nVersion on a web site by saying \"designed by ...\". However, it would be appropriate to acknowledge the author(s) if \r\nyour software package has a list of people who deserve thanks. We realize that this can seem to be a gray area, but \r\nthe standard used to judge an acknowledgement is that if the acknowledgement benefits the author(s) it is allowed, but \r\nif it primarily benefits other parties, or could reflect poorly on the author(s), then it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n2  ABOUT MODIFYING OFL LICENSED FONTS\r\n\r\n2.1  Can I change the fonts? Are there any limitations to what things I can and cannot change?\r\nYou are allowed to change anything, as long as such changes do not violate the terms of the license. In other words, \r\nyou are not allowed to remove the copyright statement(s) from the font, but you could add additional information into \r\nit that covers your contribution.\r\n\r\n2.2  I have a font that needs a few extra glyphs - can I take them from an OFL licensed font and copy them into mine?\r\nYes, but if you distribute that font to others it must be under the OFL, and include the information mentioned in condition \r\n2 of the license","risk":2,"spdx":"OFL-1.1","trademark":0,"unique_id":"764de6a2-88cb-45d0-8669-99ae06763d16"}
