All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\nreserved.\n\n\n4. Restrictions.\n\nThe license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n\n   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You\n      must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this\n      License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.  You\n      may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the\n      terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep intact all\n      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.\n      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control\n      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this\n      License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from\n      the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.  If You\n      create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the\n      extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such\n      Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a\n      Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such\n      Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n   2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,\n      and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,\n      this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You\n      distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n      perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works\n      that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'\n      exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all\n      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.\n      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures\n      that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the\n      terms of this License Agreement.  The above applies to the Derivative\n      Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n      Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject\n      to the terms of this License.\n   3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,\n      You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the\n      Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are\n      utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the\n      Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the\n      case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in\n      the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n      Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\").\n      Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a\n      minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship\n      credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other\n      comparable authorship credit.\n\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n   1. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor\n      represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after\n      reasonable inquiry:\n         1. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the\n            license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the\n            rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay\n            any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other\n            payments;\n         2. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity\n            rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or\n            constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury\n            to any third party.\n   2.

Limitation on Liability.\n\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING\nFROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN\nSECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED\nOF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n7. Termination\n\n   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n      Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective\n      Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n      terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n      compliance with those licenses.  Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n      survive any termination of this License.\n   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n      Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n      any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n      withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required\n      to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will\n      continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\n      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\n      this License.\n   2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the\n      same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n      License.\n   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the\n      minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed\n      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n      respect to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings,\n      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n      here.
