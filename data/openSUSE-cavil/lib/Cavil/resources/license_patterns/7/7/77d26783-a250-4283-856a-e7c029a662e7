It also counts as the\n successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version\n number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\nbased on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if\nyou wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you\ncan change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you\nare informed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave ou. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code\nwith the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so\nthat they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library\nand recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and\n(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and\/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\nwarranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else\nand passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the\noriginal version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected\nby problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent\nholder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\nlicense.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the\nordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in\norder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License\ntherefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria\nof freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for\nlinking other code with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to\nprotect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\nprovides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\nnon-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary\nGeneral Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto\nstandard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the\nlibrary. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely\nused non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the\nfree library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\nGNU\/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified\nversion of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\nto run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party\nsaying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public\nLicense (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as\nto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\nfunctions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\nLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nlibrary.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the\nLibrary is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the\nLibrary in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the\nLibrary does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along\nwith the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  \n     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\n     that you changed the files and the date of any change.  \n     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\n     third parties under the terms of this License.  \n     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\n     data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\n     than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\n     a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\n     supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\n     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\n     that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\n     Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used\n     by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n     the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\n     sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\n     reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\n     this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\n     distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\n     sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\n     distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n     permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\n     each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n     rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\n     the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\n     based on the Library.\n\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\n     the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\n     or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\n     this License","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"77d26783-a250-4283-856a-e7c029a662e7"}
