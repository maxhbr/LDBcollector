The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked\nVersion&rdquo;.\n<\/p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n<\/p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and\/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li> Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li> Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nunder this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n<\/li><li>\nunder the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<\/li><li> Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\n<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<\/li><li>\nProvide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\nyou use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\nCode. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<\/li><li> Combined Libraries.\n\n<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nAccompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n<\/li><li>\nGive prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n<\/li><\/ol>\n\n<\/li><li> Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
