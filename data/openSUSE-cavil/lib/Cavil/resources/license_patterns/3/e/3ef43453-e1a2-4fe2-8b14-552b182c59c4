However, nothing else grants you permission to mod\"\n  \"ify or\\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions \"\n  \"are\\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

If you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy\"\n  \" simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pert\"\n  \"inent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Li\"\n  \"brary at all.  For example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royal\"\n  \"ty-free redistribution of the Library by\\nall those who receive copies \"\n  \"directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisf\"\n  \"y both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribut\"\n  \"ion of the Library.\\n\\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid o\"\n  \"r unenforceable under any\\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the \"\n  \"section is intended to apply,\\nand the section as a whole is intended t\"\n  \"o apply in other circumstances.\\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this sectio\"\n  \"n to induce you to infringe any\\npatents or other property right claims\"\n  \" or to contest validity of any\\nsuch claims; this section has the sole \"\n  \"purpose of protecting the\\nintegrity of the free software distribution \"\n  \"system which is\\nimplemented by public license practices.
