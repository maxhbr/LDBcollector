Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and\npublisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made\nby others.\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves\nbe free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\ndesigned for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs\nfree documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\ndoes. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless\nof subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n9.4.2\n\nApplicability and definitions\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the\ncopyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a worldwide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The\n“Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring\npermission under copyright law.\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,\neither copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals\nexclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.\n(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related\nmatters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of\nInvariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does\nnot fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document\nmay contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there\nare none.\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or BackCover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text\nmay be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose\nspecification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"3c816774-0fbb-4ea1-84d9-135d3e540992"}
