Because GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages or sample CDs.  Regardless, many \"free\" SoundFonts available on the web may indeed contain samples of questionable origin.  My understanding of the copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a commercial software product.  That being said, I have never received any complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"3c242007-fabd-4a21-9772-b055a953d055"}
