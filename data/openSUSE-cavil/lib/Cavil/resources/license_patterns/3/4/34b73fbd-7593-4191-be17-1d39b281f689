Exception for Free\/Libre and Open Source\nSoftware-only Applications Using yaSSL Libraries (the \"FLOSS Exception\").\n\n*Exception Intent*\n\nWe want specified Free\/Libre and Open Source Software (\"FLOSS\")\napplications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed yaSSL\nlibraries (the \"Program\") despite the fact that not all FLOSS\nlicenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public\nLicense (the \"GPL\").\n\n*Legal Terms and Conditions*\n\nAs a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of\nthe GPL:\n\n  1.     You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed\n     entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a \"FLOSS\n     Work\") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below\n     in section 1, as long as:\n\n       1.      You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the\n          Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the\n          Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,\n          and which can reasonably be considered independent and\n          separate works in themselves,\n\n       2.      all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which\n          are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be\n          considered independent and separate works in themselves,\n\n             *       i\n\n               are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses\n               listed below, and\n\n             *       ii\n\n               the object code or executable form of those sections are\n               accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable\n               source code for those sections on the same medium and under\n               the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or\n               executable forms of those sections, and\n\n\n       3.      any works which are aggregated with the Program or with\n          a Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution\n          medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be considered\n          independent and separate works in themselves which are not\n          derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS\n          Work.\n\n\n     If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be\n     copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and\n     conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from\n     Sawtooth Consulting Ltd.\n\n  2.

Applicability This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that\n     contain a notice placed by Sawtooth Consulting Ltd. saying that the\n     Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception.\n     If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of\n     both the Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then\n     this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work; thus, you\n     must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and\n     comply with the GPL in all respects, including by retaining all\n     GPL notices. You may choose to redistribute a copy of the\n     Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by removing the\n     FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Program, provided","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"34b73fbd-7593-4191-be17-1d39b281f689"}
