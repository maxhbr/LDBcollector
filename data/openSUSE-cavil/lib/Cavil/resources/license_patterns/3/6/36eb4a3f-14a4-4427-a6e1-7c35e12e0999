In many instances Intel is required to\nprovide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and\ngovernmental regulations before certification or approval to use the\nproduct is granted. Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, and\nsoftware driver are designed to carefully control parameters that affect\nradio operation and to ensure electromagnetic compliance (EMC). These\nparameters include, without limitation, RF power, spectrum usage,\nchannel scanning, and human exposure.\n\nFor these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties\nof the software provided in binary format with the wireless WLAN\nadapters (e.g., the EEPROM and firmware). Furthermore, if you use any\npatches, utilities, or code with the Intel wireless LAN adapters that\nhave been manipulated by an unauthorized party (i.e., patches,\nutilities, or code (including open source code modifications) which have\nnot been validated by Intel), (i) you will be solely responsible for\nensuring the regulatory compliance of the products, (ii) Intel will bear\nno liability, under any theory of liability for any issues associated\nwith the modified products, including without limitation, claims under\nthe warranty and\/or issues arising from regulatory non-compliance, and\n(iii) Intel will not provide or be required to assist in providing\nsupport to any third parties for such modified products.\n\nNote: Many regulatory agencies consider Wireless LAN adapters to be\nmodules, and accordingly, condition system-level regulatory approval\nupon receipt and review of test data documenting that the antennas and\nsystem configuration do not cause the EMC and radio operation to be\nnon-compliant.\n\nThe drivers available for download from SourceForge are provided as a\npart of a development project.  Conformance to local regulatory\nrequirements is the responsibility of the individual developer.
