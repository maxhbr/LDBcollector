And you must show them these terms so they know their\n+rights.\n+\n+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\n+we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\n+original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\n+on the original authors' reputations.\n+\n+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n+program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\n+all.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n+notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n+under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\n+refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n+either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\n+language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n+the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\n+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n+(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n+is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n+code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n+and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n+and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n+this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n+recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\n+Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n+fee.\n+\n+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n+it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n+such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\n+provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n+    parties under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n+    License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n+    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\n+    Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n+it","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"36540a80-3116-4adb-9873-cc07fe0e55cc"}
