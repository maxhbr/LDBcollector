By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share and change free software---to make sure\nthe software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies\nto most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program\nwhose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand\/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If\nthe software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its\nrecipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any\nproblems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"356c13c1-754c-4263-ad09-d2a7037da2e3"}
