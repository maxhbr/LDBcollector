Definitions.\r\n\r\n   \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity\r\n   authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement\r\n   with IBM. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and\r\n   all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under\r\n   common control with that entity are considered to be a single\r\n   Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\r\n   (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\r\n   management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or\r\n   (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding\r\n   shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n   \"Contribution\" shall mean the code, documentation or other original\r\n   works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as\r\n   any original work of authorship, including any modifications or\r\n   additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by\r\n   You to IBM for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project managed\r\n   by IBM (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\r\n   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to\r\n   IBM or its representatives, including but not limited to communication\r\n   on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue\r\n   tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, IBM for the\r\n   purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding\r\n   communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated\r\n   in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n2. Grant of Copyright License.\r\n\r\n   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,\r\n   You hereby grant to IBM and to recipients of software\r\n   distributed by IBM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,\r\n   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to\r\n   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\r\n   publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions\r\n   and such derivative works.\r\n\r\n3. Grant of Patent License.\r\n\r\n   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,\r\n   You hereby grant to IBM and to recipients of software\r\n   distributed by IBM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,\r\n   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as\r\n   stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\r\n   offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\r\n   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\r\n   by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)\r\n   alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to\r\n   which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes\r\n   patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a\r\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your\r\n   Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes\r\n   direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\r\n   granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or\r\n   Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above\r\n   license.\r\n\r\n   You represent further that each employee of the Corporation\r\n   designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written\r\n   modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit\r\n   Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.\r\n\r\n5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original\r\n   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).\r\n\r\n6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,\r\n   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide\r\n   support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

It is your responsibility to notify IBM when any change\r\n   is required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit\r\n   Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's\r\n   Point of Contact with IBM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease sign: __________________________________ Date: _______________\r\n\r\nTitle:       __________________________________\r\n\r\nCorporation: __________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule A\r\n\r\n   [Initial list of designated employees.
