Their\r\nimplementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use\r\ncreations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their\r\ntypes and ways of expression.\r\n\r\nWhile the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is\r\nrestricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by\r\nthe Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a\r\nwork’s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to\r\nincrease creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right\r\nto use a work, and acknowledges the right holder’s and the user’s\r\nrights and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and\r\nFree Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human\r\nmind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They\r\nallow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\n\r\nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect\r\nthese creations of the human mind according to the principles of\r\ncopyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition\r\nof exclusive appropriation.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\n“work” either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the\r\ncommon work as defined hereafter:\r\n\r\n“common work” means a work composed of the initial work and all\r\nsubsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial\r\nauthor is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the\r\nconditions under which contributions are made.\r\n\r\n“Initial work” means the work created by the initiator of the common\r\nwork (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by\r\nwhoever wants to\r\n\r\n“Subsequent works” means the contributions made by authors who\r\nparticipate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the\r\nrights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n“Originals” (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of\r\neither the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and\r\nused by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,\r\ninterpretations, copies or reproductions.\r\n\r\n“Copy” means any reproduction of an original as defined by this\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n1. OBJECT\r\n\r\nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one\r\ncan use this work freely.\r\n\r\n2. SCOPE\r\n\r\nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author\r\nspecifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.\r\n\r\n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)\r\n\r\nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any\r\nother person, whatever the technique used.\r\n\r\n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC\r\n\r\nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified\r\nor not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge,\r\nprovided that you: attach this license without any modification to the\r\ncopies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be\r\nfound, specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the\r\noriginals, including yours if you have modified the work, specify to\r\nthe recipient where to access the originals (either initial or\r\nsubsequent).\r\n\r\nThe authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right\r\nto distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.\r\n\r\n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY\r\n\r\nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial\r\nor subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all\r\nconditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;\r\nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what\r\nkind of modifications have been made; distribute the subsequent work\r\nunder the same license or any compatible license.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it\r\nunder the same conditions as the copies.\r\n\r\n3. RELATED RIGHTS\r\n\r\nActivities giving rise to author’s rights and related rights shall not\r\nchallenge the rights granted by this license.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to\r\nthe same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the\r\nwork in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent\r\nanyone from using the work under the same conditions as those defined\r\nin this license.\r\n\r\n4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK\r\n\r\nIncorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the\r\nFree Art License shall not challenge the rights granted by this\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nIf the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in\r\nwhich it is incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed\r\nunder the condition that the larger work is subject either to the Free\r\nArt License or a compatible license.\r\n\r\n5. COMPATIBILITY\r\n\r\nA license is compatible with the Free Art License provided: it gives\r\nthe right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including\r\nfor commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those\r\nrequired by the respect of the other compatibility criteria; it\r\nensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to\r\nprevious versions of the work when possible; it recognizes the Free\r\nArt License as compatible (reciprocity); it requires that changes made\r\nto the work be subject to the same license or to a license which also\r\nmeets these compatibility criteria.\r\n\r\n6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThis license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your\r\ncontribution or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of this common work, you only agree to grant others the\r\nsame rights with regard to your contribution as those you were granted\r\nby this license. Conferring these rights does not mean you have to\r\ngive up your intellectual rights.\r\n\r\n7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\r\n\r\nThe freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right\r\nto copy, distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for\r\ntheir own actions.\r\n\r\n8.

This license will remain in effect for as long as the\r\ncopyright which is attached to the work. If you do not respect the\r\nterms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it\r\nconfers.\r\n\r\nIf the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it\r\nimpossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not\r\nmake use of the rights which it confers.\r\n\r\n9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate\r\nimprovements by its authors (instigators of the “Copyleft Attitude”\r\nmovement) by way of new, numbered versions.\r\n\r\nYou will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in\r\nthe version under which the copy of the work was distributed to you,\r\nor alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent\r\nversions.\r\n\r\n10. SUB-LICENSING\r\n\r\nSub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to\r\nmake use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the\r\nauthors of the common work.\r\n\r\n11.
