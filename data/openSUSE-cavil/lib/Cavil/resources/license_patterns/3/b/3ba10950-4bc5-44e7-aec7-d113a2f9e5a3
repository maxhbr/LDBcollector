This is generally\r\nfine for in-house or open-source use. But if you want to use it in a\r\nclosed-source commercial product, you may need to negotiate a separate\r\nlicense with them. By contrast, most Python software uses a less\r\nrestrictive license; Python has its own license, and ReportLab uses the\r\nFreeBSD license for our PDF Toolkit, which means you CAN use it in\r\ncommercial products.\r\n\r\nWe licensed RXP for our commercial products, but are releasing pyRXP\r\nunder the GPL. (We did try to persuade Edinburgh to release under a\r\nPython style license, but they declined; otherwise pyRXP might have\r\nbecome the Python standard.)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use pyRXP for a commercial product, you\r\nneed to purchase a license. We are authorised resellers for RXP and can\r\nsell you a commercial license to use it in your own products.
