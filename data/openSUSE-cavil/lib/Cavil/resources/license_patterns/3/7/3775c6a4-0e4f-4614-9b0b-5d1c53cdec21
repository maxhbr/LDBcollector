This notice is required to be provided under our contract with the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy (DOE).  This work was produced at the University of\nCalifornia, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract No.\nW-7405-ENG-48 with the DOE.\n\nB.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program,\" below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you.\"\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a)  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b)  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\n    or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\n    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms\n    of this License.\n\n    c)  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nwork.  But when you distribute the same section as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3.  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b)  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to \n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically \n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the \n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c)  Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose to this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8.  If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n9.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the \nGeneral Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in \nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion,\" you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for \npermission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, \nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  \nOur decision to grant permission will be guided by the two goals of preserving \nthe free status of all derivatives of our free software and or promoting the \nsharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11.  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"3775c6a4-0e4f-4614-9b0b-5d1c53cdec21"}
