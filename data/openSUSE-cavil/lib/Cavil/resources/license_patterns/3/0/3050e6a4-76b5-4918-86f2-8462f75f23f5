In this section we explain the essence of the different licenses, as well as the rationale why we have chosen \r\nthem.<\/para><para>The fact that CGAL is Open Source software does not mean that users are free to do whatever they want \r\nwith the software. Using the software means to accept the license, which has the status of a contract between the user \r\nand the owner of the CGAL software.<\/para><sect1 id=\"license_1licensesGPL\">\r\n<title>GNU GPL<\/title>\r\n<para>The GNU GPL is an Open Source license that, if you distribute your software based on GPLed CGAL data structures, \r\nobliges you to distribute the source code of your software under the GPL.<\/para><para>The exact license terms can be \r\nfound at the Free Software Foundation web site: <ulink url=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/gpl.html\">http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/gpl.html<\/ulink>.<\/para><\/sect1>\r\n<sect1 id=\"license_1licensesLGPL\">\r\n<title>GNU LGPL<\/title>\r\n<para>The GNU LGPL is an Open Source license that obliges you to distribute modifications you make on CGAL software \r\naccessible to the users.

The former \r\nrestricts commercial use, and the latter allows to promote software as de facto standard so that people can build new \r\nhigher level data structures on top.<\/para><para>Therefore, the packages forming a foundation layer are distributed \r\nunder the LGPL, and the higher level packages under the GPL. The package overview states for each package under which \r\nlicense it is distributed.<\/para><\/sect1>\r\n<sect1 id=\"license_1licensesCommercial\">\r\n<title>Commercial Licenses<\/title>\r\n<para>Users who cannot comply with the Open Source license terms can buy individual data structures under various commercial \r\nlicenses from GeometryFactory: <ulink url=\"http:\/\/www.geometryfactory.com\/\">http:\/\/www.geometryfactory.com\/<\/ulink>. \r\nLicense fees paid by commercial customers are reinvested in R&amp;D performed by the CGAL project partners, as well \r\nas in evolutive maintenance.<\/para><\/sect1>\r\n<sect1 id=\"license_1licenseCheck\">\r\n<title>License Checking<\/title>\r\n<para>Users who have a commercial license for specific packages can check that they do not accidentally use packages \r\nfor which they do not have a commercial license.
