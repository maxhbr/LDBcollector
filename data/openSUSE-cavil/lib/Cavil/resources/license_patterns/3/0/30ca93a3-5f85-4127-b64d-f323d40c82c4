AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\n  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\n  resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\n  of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\n  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\n  apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\n  derivative works of the Document.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\n  the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\n  covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\n  electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\n  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\n  aggregate.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>8. TRANSLATION<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\n  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n  translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n  Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions\n  of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\n  the translation and the original version of this License or a notice\n  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n  \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\n  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\n  title.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>9. TERMINATION<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\n  as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\n  copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\n  automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\n  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\n  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n  parties remain in full compliance.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\n  of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n  http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\n  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\n  License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\n  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\n  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\n  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\n  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\n  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>How to use this License for your documents<\/h3>\n\n<p>\n  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\n  the License in the document and put the following copyright and\n  license notices just after the title page:\n<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n  Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\n  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\n  Texts.
