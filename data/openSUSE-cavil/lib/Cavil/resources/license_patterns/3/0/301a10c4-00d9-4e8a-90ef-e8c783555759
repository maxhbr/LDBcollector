License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, \r\nnon-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as \r\nstated below:\r\n\r\n    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated \r\nin the Collections; and,\r\n    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\r\n\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights \r\ninclude the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and \r\nformats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by \r\nLicensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, \r\nor the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. \r\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient \r\nof the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense \r\nthe Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every \r\ncopy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose \r\nany effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise \r\nthe rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated \r\nin a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms \r\nof this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove \r\nfrom the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\r\n    You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended \r\nfor or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted \r\nworks by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial \r\nadvantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection \r\nwith the exchange of copyrighted works.\r\n    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant \r\nto Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are \r\nutilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original Author \r\nand\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution \r\n(\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such \r\nparty or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, \r\nthat Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing \r\ninformation for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, \r\nhowever, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors \r\nof Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other \r\ncontributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose \r\nof attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly \r\nor explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or \r\nAttribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission \r\nof the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\n    For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n        Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through \r\nany statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect \r\nsuch royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\n        Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through \r\nany statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such \r\nroyalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a \r\npurpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right \r\nto collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\r\n        Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in \r\nthe event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that \r\nsociety, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise \r\nthan noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).\r\n    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You \r\nReproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, \r\nmutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original \r\nAuthor's honor or reputation.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS \r\nOR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, \r\nWARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR \r\nOTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT \r\nALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO \r\nYOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS \r\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of \r\nthis License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have \r\ntheir licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections \r\n1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable \r\ncopyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license \r\nterms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw \r\nthis License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and \r\nthis License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license \r\nto the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity \r\nor enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, \r\nsuch provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent \r\nshall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There \r\nare no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not \r\nbe bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified \r\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology \r\nof the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome \r\nConvention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal \r\nCopyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction \r\nin which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation \r\nof those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable \r\ncopyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included \r\nin the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\r\n","risk":2,"spdx":"CC-BY-3.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"301a10c4-00d9-4e8a-90ef-e8c783555759"}
