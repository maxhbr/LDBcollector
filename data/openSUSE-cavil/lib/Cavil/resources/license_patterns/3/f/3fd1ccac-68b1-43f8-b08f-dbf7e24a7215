{"export_restricted":0,"license":"infozip","packname":"unzip","patent":0,"pattern":"contains some details about the copyright history of\n   contributions to the UnZip project.\n   Additionally, it summarises some exceptions to the general BSD-like\n   copyright found in LICENSE that covers our generic code and most of\n   the system specific ports.\n   Please read LICENSE first to find out what is allowed to do with\n   Info-ZIP's UnZip code.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n   There are currently two explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip\n   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):\n   Jim Luther's Mac OS File Manager interface code; and Christopher Evans'\n   MacBinaryIII coding code (for the MacOS port)..  These copyrights\n   are discussed in more detail below.\n\n   All remaining code is now (starting with UnZip version 5.41) covered\n   by the new Info-ZIP license. For details, please read the acompaning\n   file LICENSE. The terms and conditions in this license supersede the\n   copyright conditions of the contributions by Igor Mandrichenko\n   (vms\/vms.c), Greg Roelofs (zipinfo.c, new version of unshrink.c),\n   Mike White (Windows DLL code in \"windll\/*\"), Steve P. Miller (Pocket\n   UnZip GUI \"wince\/*\"), and Mark Adler (inflate\/explode decompresseion\n   core routines, previously put into the public domain). All these\n   Info-ZIP contributors (or \"primary\" authors) have permitted us to\n   replace their copyright notes by the Info-ZIP License.\n\n   Frequently Asked Questions regarding (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip\n   are near the end of this file.\n\n   There are no known patents on any of the code in UnZip.  Unisys\n   claims a patent on LZW encoding and on LZW decoding _in an apparatus\n   that performs LZW encoding_, but the patent appears to exempt a stand-\n   alone decoder (as in UnZip's unshrink.c).  Unisys has publicly claimed\n   otherwise, but the issue has never been tested in court.  Since this\n   point is unclear, unshrinking is not enabled by default.  It is the\n   responsibility of the user to make his or her peace with Unisys and\n   its licensing requirements.  (unshrink.c may be removed from future\n   releases altogether.)\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and\n   almost entirely rewritten (changes include random zipfile access\n   rather than sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode();\n   replacement of old unshrink() with new (unrelated) unshrink(); re-\n   placement of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards,\n   filename-mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can\n   tell, only the core code of the unreduce method remained substantially\n   similar to Mr. Smith's original source.  As of UnZip 5.42, the complete\n   core code is now covered by the Info-ZIP Licence.  Therefore, support\n   for the reduce method has been removed.\n   The drop of the reduce method should only affect some test archives,\n   reducing was never used in any publically distributed Zip program.\n   For pathologic cases where support for reduced archive entries is\n   needed, the unreduce code copyrighted by Samuel H. Smith is available\n   as a separate distribution (the restricted copyright of this code is\n   cited below in the \"historical\" section).\n\n   The following copyright applies to the Mac OS File Manager interface code\n   (macos\/source\/macstuff.[ch]), distributed with UnZip 5.4 and later","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"3fd1ccac-68b1-43f8-b08f-dbf7e24a7215"}
