If it is not\r\npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\r\nits structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such\r\nas a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\r\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\r\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\r\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\r\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\r\nContributor.

The notice must be conspicuously included\r\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\r\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\r\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\r\nCode under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\r\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\r\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version does\r\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source\r\nCode version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\r\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must\r\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\r\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\r\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\r\nevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\r\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\r\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\r\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\r\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\r\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\r\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\r\nthe code they affect.

Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\r\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6.
