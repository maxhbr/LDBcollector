Dual licensing\nof the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both\nfor the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the\nGPL.\n\nYou can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only\nquestion is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute\nmodifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different\nranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license\nused, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or\nadded features.\n\nNote that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions\npackage.
