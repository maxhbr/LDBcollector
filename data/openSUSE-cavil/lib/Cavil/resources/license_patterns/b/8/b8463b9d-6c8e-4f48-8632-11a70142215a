Accurate metadata in your font files is beneficial to you as an increasing number of applications are exposing this information to the user. For example, clickable links can bring users back to your website and let them know about other work you have done or services you provide. Depending on the format of your fonts and sources, you can use template human-readable headers or machine-readable metadata.\n7.3  Write an initial FONTLOG for your font and include it in the release package.\n7.4  Include the OFL license file in your release package.\n7.5  We also highly recommend you include the relevant practical documentation on the license by putting the OFL-FAQ in your package.\n7.6  If you wish, you can use the OFL Graphics on your web page.\n\nThat's all.
