But this License is not \r\nlimited to\r\nsoftware manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a \r\nprinted book.\r\nWe recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. \r\n<\/P\r\n><\/DIV\r\n><DIV\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><H2\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><A\r\nNAME=\"AEN1831\"\r\n><\/A\r\n>E.3.2. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/H2\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying \r\nit can be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public \r\nis a\r\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\". \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied \r\nverbatim, or\r\nwith modifications and\/or translated into another language. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with \r\nthe relationship\r\nof the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains \r\nnothing that\r\ncould fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, \r\na Secondary\r\nSection may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject \r\nor with\r\nrelated matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant \r\nSections, in the\r\nnotice that says that the Document is released under this License. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, \r\nin the notice that\r\nsays that the Document is released under this License. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification \r\nis available\r\nto the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors \r\nor (for\r\nimages composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is \r\nsuitable for\r\ninput to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. \r\nA copy made in an\r\notherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by \r\nreaders is\r\nnot Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, \r\nLaTeX input\r\nformat, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.\r\nOpaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,\r\nSGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML\r\nproduced by some word processors for output purposes only. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to \r\nhold, legibly, the\r\nmaterial this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as \r\nsuch, \"Title\r\nPage\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of \r\nthe text. \r\n<\/P\r\n><\/DIV\r\n><DIV\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><H2\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><A\r\nNAME=\"AEN1841\"\r\n><\/A\r\n>E.3.3. 2.

If you use the latter option, \r\nyou must\r\ntake reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent \r\ncopy will\r\nremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy \r\n(directly or\r\nthrough your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. \r\n<\/P\r\n><P\r\n>&#13;It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any \r\nlarge number of\r\ncopies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. \r\n<\/P\r\n><\/DIV\r\n><DIV\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><H2\r\nCLASS=\"sect2\"\r\n><A\r\nNAME=\"AEN1851\"\r\n><\/A\r\n>E.3.5. 4.
