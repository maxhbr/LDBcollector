{"export_restricted":0,"license":"Any CLA","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"This section addresses the issues of copyright, license and patents for the LLVM\r\nproject.  The copyright for the code is held by the individual contributors of\r\nthe code and the terms of its license to LLVM users and developers is the\r\n`University of Illinois\/NCSA Open Source License\r\n<http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php>`_ (with portions dual licensed\r\nunder the `MIT License <http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/mit-license.php>`_,\r\nsee below).  As contributor to the LLVM project, you agree to allow any\r\ncontributions to the project to licensed under these terms.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe LLVM project does not require copyright assignments, which means that the\r\ncopyright for the code in the project is held by its respective contributors who\r\nhave each agreed to release their contributed code under the terms of the `LLVM\r\nLicense`_.\r\n\r\nAn implication of this is that the LLVM license is unlikely to ever change:\r\nchanging it would require tracking down all the contributors to LLVM and getting\r\nthem to agree that a license change is acceptable for their contribution.  Since\r\nthere are no plans to change the license, this is not a cause for concern.\r\n\r\nAs a contributor to the project, this means that you (or your company) retain\r\nownership of the code you contribute, that it cannot be used in a way that\r\ncontradicts the license (which is a liberal BSD-style license), and that the\r\nlicense for your contributions won't change without your approval in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n.. _LLVM License:\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and to use a liberal open source\r\nlicense. **As a contributor to the project, you agree that any contributions be\r\nlicensed under the terms of the corresponding subproject.** All of the code in\r\nLLVM is available under the `University of Illinois\/NCSA Open Source License\r\n<http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php>`_, which boils down to\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n* You can freely distribute LLVM.\r\n* You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM.\r\n* Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an\r\n  included readme file).\r\n* You can't use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.\r\n* There's no warranty on LLVM at all.\r\n\r\nWe believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it **allows\r\ncommercial products to be derived from LLVM** with few restrictions and without\r\na requirement for making any derived works also open source (i.e.  LLVM's\r\nlicense is not a \"copyleft\" license like the GPL). We suggest that you read the\r\n`License <http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php>`_ if further\r\nclarification is needed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the UIUC license, the runtime library components of LLVM\r\n(**compiler_rt, libc++, and libclc**) are also licensed under the `MIT License\r\n<http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/mit-license.php>`_, which does not contain\r\nthe binary redistribution clause.  As a user of these runtime libraries, it\r\nmeans that you can choose to use the code under either license (and thus don't\r\nneed the binary redistribution clause), and as a contributor to the code that\r\nyou agree that any contributions to these libraries be licensed under both\r\nlicenses.  We feel that this is important for runtime libraries, because they\r\nare implicitly linked into applications and therefore should not subject those\r\napplications to the binary redistribution clause. This also means that it is ok\r\nto move code from (e.g.)  libc++ to the LLVM core without concern, but that code\r\ncannot be moved from the LLVM core to libc++ without the copyright owner's\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nNote that the LLVM Project does distribute dragonegg, **which is\r\nGPL.** This means that anything \"linked\" into dragonegg must itself be compatible\r\nwith the GPL, and must be releasable under the terms of the GPL.  This implies\r\nthat **any code linked into dragonegg and distributed to others may be subject to\r\nthe viral aspects of the GPL** (for example, a proprietary code generator linked\r\ninto dragonegg must be made available under the GPL).  This is not a problem for\r\ncode already distributed under a more liberal license (like the UIUC license),\r\nand GPL-containing subprojects are kept in separate SVN repositories whose\r\nLICENSE.txt files specifically indicate that they contain GPL code.\r\n\r\nWe have no plans to change the license of LLVM.  If you have questions or\r\ncomments about the license, please contact the `LLVM Developer's Mailing\r\nList <mailto:llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org>`_.\r\n\r\nPatents\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, LLVM does not infringe on any patents (we have\r\nactually removed code from LLVM in the past that was found to infringe).  Having\r\ncode in LLVM that infringes on patents would violate an important goal of the\r\nproject by making it hard or impossible to reuse the code for arbitrary purposes\r\n(including commercial use).\r\n\r\nWhen contributing code, we expect contributors to notify us of any potential for\r\npatent-related trouble with their changes (including from third parties).  If\r\nyou or your employer own the rights to a patent and would like to contribute\r\ncode to LLVM that relies on it, we require that the copyright owner sign an\r\nagreement that allows any other user of LLVM to freely use your patent.  Please\r\ncontact the `LLVM Foundation Board of Directors <mailto:board@llvm.org>`_ for more","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b5c60e7b-457f-4114-bc4e-dde1753e60d2"}
