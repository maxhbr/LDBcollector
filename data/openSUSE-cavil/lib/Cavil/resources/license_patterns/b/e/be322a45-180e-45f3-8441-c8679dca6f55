And you must show them these terms so they know their\n+rights.\n+\n+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+authors' reputations.\n+\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\f\n+\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n+under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n+refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n+either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\n+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n+the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n+along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n+    parties under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\f\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n+the scope of this License.\n+\n+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"be322a45-180e-45f3-8441-c8679dca6f55"}
