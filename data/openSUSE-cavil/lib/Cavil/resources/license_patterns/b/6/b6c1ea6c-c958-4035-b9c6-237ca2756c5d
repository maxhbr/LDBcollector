We measured the synchronization error of a free-space QKD in our near-ground platform. According to experimental results and theoretical calculations, we deduce that the intensity fluctuation of synchronization light due to atmosphere disturbance contributes far more to the synchronization accuracy than others. By using the constant fraction discrimination method, the synchronization error of the free-space QKD, passing through the aerosphere, can be limited within 300 ps which meets the synchronization requirement of a satellite-to-ground QKD system.  $SKIP19 All rights reserved","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b6c1ea6c-c958-4035-b9c6-237ca2756c5d"}
