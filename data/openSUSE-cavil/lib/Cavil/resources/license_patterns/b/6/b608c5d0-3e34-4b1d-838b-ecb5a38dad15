STARTUP\r\nThe provisions of this Appendix 4 are applicable for Start-up Companies and for\r\nthe Evaluation Term.For the purpose of this Appendix 4, the following\r\nadditional definitions shall be applicable:\r\n\r\n\"Trial Term\" shall mean a period of twelve (12) months.\r\n\r\n\"Start-up Company\" means a company with a maximum annual revenue, including\r\nfunding, equivalent to 100,000 USD (in applicable currency) during a respective\r\ncalendar year, as evidenced by duly audited records of the Licensee and\r\napproved by The Qt Company.\r\n\r\nDuring the Trial Term, Section 3 shall apply with following modifications\r\n(\"Trial Term Modifications\"):\r\n    (i)     Licenses granted under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 shall be free of any\r\n            charge. For clarity, License for distribution of Devices pursuant\r\n            to Section 3.3 is subject to applicable License Fee for necessary\r\n            Distribution Licenses;\r\n    (ii)    Development License under Section 3.1 is limited to a maximum of\r\n            three (3) Designated Users; and\r\n    (iii)   Support is available subject to availability, as judged by The Qt\r\n            Company at its free and absolute discretion, provided that support\r\n            will be limited to a maximum of ten (10) tickets during the Trial\r\n            Term.\r\n\r\nUpon expiry of the Trial Term:\r\n    (a)     This Appendix 4 is terminated, Trial Term Modifications cease to\r\n            remain in force, Licensee's Development Licenses shall be\r\n            automatically converted into licenses subject to a License Fee (in\r\n            the amount specified in the quote or in Appendix 2 and payable with\r\n            a 30-day payment term) and Licensee's rights and obligations under\r\n            this Agreement shall continue to remain in force under the standard\r\n            provisions of the Agreement, unless the Licensee notifies The Qt\r\n            Company in writing no less than ninety (90) days before such expiry\r\n            date that Licensee does not agree to such continuance, in which\r\n            event the Agreement, and all rights of the Licensee thereunder,\r\n            shall expire; provided however that\r\n    (b)     in the event the Licensee still qualifies as a Start-up Company,\r\n            the Licensee has an option (\"Option\"), instead of what is stated in\r\n            item a) above, to renew the Trial Term. Renewal is limited to one\r\n            time, and the total duration of Trial Term is thus 24 months after\r\n            the effective date. Licensee shall notify The Qt Company in\r\n            writing, no less than ninety (90) days before the expiry date, if\r\n            Licensee wish to exercise the Option.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 5: NON-COMMERCIAL USE\r\nThe provisions of this Appendix 5 are applicable for non-commercial use of the\r\nLicensed Software by the Licensee.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this Appendix 5, the following additional definitions\r\n(replacing the relevant definition of the Agreement, where applicable) shall be\r\napplicable:\r\n\r\n\"Demo Units\" shall mean (i) hardware development platform, which incorporates\r\nthe Licensed Software along with Licensee's software and\/or hardware, and (ii)\r\nprototype versions of Applications or Devices.\r\n\r\n\"Designated User(s)\" shall mean the employees and students of the Licensee.\r\n\r\n\"Licensee Products\" shall mean Applications and\/or Devices.\r\n\r\n\"Permitted Purpose\" shall mean (i) Licensee's internal evaluation and testing\r\nof Licensed Software, (ii) building Demo Units as well as (iii) educational\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\"Term\" shall mean a period of twelve (12) months or any such other period as\r\nmay be agreed between the Parties.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this Appendix 5, the following changes shall be agreed with\r\nrespect to relevant Sections of the Agreement:\r\n    I.      Recital (A) shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows:\r\n\r\n            \"(A) Licensee wishes to use the Licensed Software for the Permitted\r\n            Purpose.\"\r\n\r\n    II.
