If You distribute the Executable version\n\t\t\tunder a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n\t\t\tany terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,\n\t\t\tnot by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n\t\t\tto indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n\t\t\tliability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n\t\t\ta result of any such terms You offer. \n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><B>3.7.

Such\n\t\t\tdescription must be included in the LEGAL file described in\n\t\t\tSection 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the\n\t\t\tSource Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or\n\t\t\tregulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n\t\t\trecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>5.
