Dozens of software      *\r\n * vendors already license Nmap technology such as host discovery, port    *\r\n * scanning, OS detection, version detection, and the Nmap Scripting       *\r\n * Engine.                                                                 *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on \"derivative works\",  *\r\n * yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid   *\r\n * misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   *\r\n * allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        *\r\n * derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   *\r\n * following with any software or content covered by this license          *\r\n * (\"Covered Software\"):                                                   *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Reads or includes copyrighted data files, such as Nmap's nmap-os-db   *\r\n * or nmap-service-probes.                                                 *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *\r\n * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *\r\n * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *\r\n * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *\r\n * Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form does not        *\r\n * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *\r\n * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *\r\n * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *\r\n * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *\r\n * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *\r\n * Internet).                                                              *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  *\r\n * above.                                                                  *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *\r\n * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *\r\n * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *\r\n * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *\r\n * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *\r\n * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *\r\n * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * As another special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants  *\r\n * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *\r\n * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *\r\n * listed in the included docs\/licenses\/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *\r\n * linked combinations including the two.                                  *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *\r\n * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *\r\n * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *\r\n * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *\r\n * allowed.  All GPL references to \"this License\", are to be treated as    *\r\n * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *\r\n * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *\r\n * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *\r\n * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *\r\n * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *\r\n * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *\r\n * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *\r\n * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *\r\n * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *\r\n * Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also    *\r\n * offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary            *\r\n * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *\r\n * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *\r\n * as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the      *\r\n * continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further *\r\n * information.                                                            *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *\r\n * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *\r\n * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *\r\n * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *\r\n * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none     *\r\n * have been found so far).                                                *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *\r\n * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *\r\n * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *\r\n * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *\r\n * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *\r\n * source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) *\r\n * that you are offering the Nmap Project (Insecure.Com LLC) the           *\r\n * unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the      *\r\n * code.  Nmap will always be available Open Source, but this is important *\r\n * because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems *\r\n * for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also       *\r\n * occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.    *\r\n * If you wish to specify special license conditions of your               *\r\n * contributions, just say so when you send them.                          *\r\n *                                                                         *\r\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but     *\r\n * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of              *\r\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
