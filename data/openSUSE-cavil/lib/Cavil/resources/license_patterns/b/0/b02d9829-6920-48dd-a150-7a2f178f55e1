Effective Date<\/h3>\r\n<p>The licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the \r\ndate the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"limitations-on-grant-scope\">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<\/h3>\r\n<p>The licenses granted in this Section&nbsp;2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or \r\nlicenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding \r\nSection&nbsp;2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:<\/p>\r\n<ol type=\"a\">\r\n<li><p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the \r\ncombination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be \r\nnecessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section&nbsp;3.4).<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"subsequent-licenses\">2.4.

Conditions<\/h3>\r\n<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"responsibilities\">3. Responsibilities<\/h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"distribution-of-source-form\">3.1. Distribution of Source Form<\/h3>\r\n<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You \r\ncontribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered \r\nSoftware is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to \r\nalter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"distribution-of-executable-form\">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<\/h3>\r\n<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<\/p>\r\n<ol type=\"a\">\r\n<li><p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section&nbsp;3.1, and You must \r\ninform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely \r\nmanner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, \r\nprovided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source \r\nCode Form under this License.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h3 id=\"distribution-of-a-larger-work\">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<\/h3>\r\n<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the \r\nrequirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work \r\ngoverned by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this \r\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that \r\nthe recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this \r\nLicense or such Secondary License(s).<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"notices\">3.4. Notices<\/h3>\r\n<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers \r\nof warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may \r\nalter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"application-of-additional-terms\">3.5. Application of Additional Terms<\/h3>\r\n<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more \r\nrecipients of Covered Software.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<\/h2>\r\n<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered \r\nSoftware due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the \r\nmaximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text \r\nfile included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute \r\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand \r\nit.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"termination\">5. Termination<\/h2>\r\n<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. \r\nHowever, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) \r\nprovisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, \r\nif such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come \r\nback into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such \r\nContributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of \r\nnon-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the \r\nnotice.<\/p>\r\n<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory \r\njudgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any \r\npatent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section&nbsp;2.1 of this \r\nLicense shall terminate.<\/p>\r\n<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections&nbsp;5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding \r\ndistributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to \r\ntermination shall survive termination.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer-of-warranty\">6. Disclaimer of Warranty<\/h2>\r\n<p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either \r\nexpressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, \r\nmerchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the \r\nCovered Software is with You.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability \r\nfor death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. \r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and \r\nlimitation may not apply to You.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"litigation\">8. Litigation<\/h2>\r\n<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains \r\nits principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its \r\nconflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or \r\ncounter-claims.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">9. Miscellaneous<\/h2>\r\n<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is \r\nheld to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or \r\nregulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to \r\nconstrue this License against a Contributor.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"versions-of-the-license\">10.
