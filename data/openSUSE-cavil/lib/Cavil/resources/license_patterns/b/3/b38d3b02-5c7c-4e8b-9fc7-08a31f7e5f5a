Specifically, you may use ripgrep under the terms of either\nlicense.\n\nThe reason why ripgrep is dual licensed this way is two-fold:\n\n1. I, as ripgrep's author, would like to participate in a small bit of\n   ideological activism by promoting the Unlicense's goal: to disclaim\n   copyright monopoly interest.\n2. I, as ripgrep's author, would like as many people to use rigprep as\n   possible. Since the Unlicense is not a proven or well known license, ripgrep\n   is also offered under the MIT license, which is ubiquitous and accepted by\n   almost everyone.\n\nMore specifically, ripgrep and all its dependencies are compatible with this\nlicensing choice. In particular, ripgrep's dependencies (direct and transitive)\nwill always be limited to permissive licenses. That is, ripgrep will never\ndepend on code that is not permissively licensed. This means rejecting any\ndependency that uses a copyleft license such as the GPL, LGPL, MPL or any of\nthe Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses. Whether the license is \"weak\"\ncopyleft or not does not matter; ripgrep will **not** depend on it","risk":1,"spdx":"MIT OR Unlicense","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b38d3b02-5c7c-4e8b-9fc7-08a31f7e5f5a"}
