JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is intended for compressing &quot;real-world&quot; scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit. JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.<\/i> -- quoted from <tt>src\/3rdparty\/libjpeg\/README<\/tt>.<\/p>\n<p>See <tt>src\/3rdparty\/libjpeg\/README<\/tt> for license details","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b33878f5-ee0d-4377-b0ec-40d988da3025"}
