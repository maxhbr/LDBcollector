Besides\noften being distributed at no cost to you, Free in this context means that the copyright holders to Hamlib have agreed\nto offer their collective work under terms that give you certain rights that allow you to modify and\/or redistribute\nHamlib under the same terms that you received it from them.\n\nSuch licensing is often termed copyleft as a play against the common “all rights reserved” terms of normal copyright.\nIn general, copyleft provides everyone with a license to modify and distribute the modified work or to simply\ndistribute a copyrighted work under certain terms. Hamlib source code is copyrighted by its authors and is licensed by\nthem under two common licenses—the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL for the “front end” and “back end” library\nsource code files, and the GNU General Public License GPL for the supplied programs source code files. The full text of\nthe LGPL and the GPL can be found in the files COPYING.LIB and COPYING in the root directory of the Hamlib source\narchive.\n\nThis manual is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License GFDL with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and\nno Back-Cover Texts. Source code examples in this manual are parallel licensed under the GPL unless otherwise noted.\n\nAs part of the Copyleft nature of the licenses, the authors of Hamlib must forbid you from distributing Hamlib under\nterms that forbid others from exercising the same rights you received. You must give anyone you distribute Hamlib to\nthe same rights to obtain, modify, and distribute the Hamlib source code that you received nor may you license Hamlib\nunder other terms than those you received. Any recipients of Hamlib must be informed of the rights to the source code\nthat they have received.\n\nFinally, the authors of Hamlib require that it be understood that NO WARRANTY of any kind is offered to anyone\nreceiving the Hamlib source code distribution. Anyone distributing modified versions of Hamlib has the responsibility\nto inform any recipients that what they have is not the official release of Hamlib by its authors and should be\nprepared to support the modified version(s). This is to preserve the reputations of the Hamlib authors and the Hamlib\nProject.
