{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-3.0+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to\n    take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the\n    <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License is intended to guarantee your\n    freedom to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it\n    remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,\n    use the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License for most of our\n    software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\n    authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n    General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\n    to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),\n    that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can\n    change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you\n    know you can do these things.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these\n    rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain\n    responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify\n    it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\n    for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you\n    received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Developers that use the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>\n    protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,\n    and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy,\n    distribute and\/or modify it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    For the developers&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; protection, the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> clearly explains that there is no warranty for this\n    free software.  For both users&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; sake, the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> requires that modified versions be marked as changed,\n    so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of\n    previous versions.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n    versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.\n    This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&rsquo;\n    freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\n    in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\n    is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such\n    problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this\n    provision to those domains in future versions of the <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>,\n    as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States\n    should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on\n    general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the\n    special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it\n    effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>\n    assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n    follow.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead>\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    0. Definitions.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    &ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym>\n    General Public License.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other\n    kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    &ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n    this License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.\n    &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or\n    organizations.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of\n    the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making\n    of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified\n    version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the\n    earlier work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work\n    based on the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without\n    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\n    under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or\n    modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with\n    or without modification), making available to the public, and in some\n    countries other activities as well.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables\n    other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\n    through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal\n    Notices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently\n    visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent\n    that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this\n    License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents\n    a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\n    list meets this criterion.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    1. Source Code.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the\n    work for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any\n    non-source form of a work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an\n    official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\n    widely used among developers working in that language.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything,\n    other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,\n    and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or\n    to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available\n    to the public in source code form.  A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this\n    context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so\n    on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work\n    runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter\n    used to run it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means\n    all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&rsquo;s\n    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which\n    are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes\n    interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n    the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that\n    the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\n    communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of\n    the work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n    automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    2. Basic Permissions.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\n    on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.\n    This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the\n    unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by\n    this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered\n    work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other\n    equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\n    without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You\n    may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make\n    modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for\n    running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License\n    in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those\n    thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on\n    your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them\n    from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their\n    relationship with you.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\n    conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it\n    unnecessary.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    3. Protecting Users&rsquo; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\n    under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\n    copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\n    restricting circumvention of such measures.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is\n    effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\n    work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of\n    the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&rsquo;s users, your or\n    third parties&rsquo; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological\n    measures.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&rsquo;s source code as you\n    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\n    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all\n    notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in\n    accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the\n    absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License\n    along with the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you\n    may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce\n    it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section\n    4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n  <\/para>\n  <orderedlist numeration=\"loweralpha\">\n    <listitem>\n      <para>\n        The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and\n        giving a relevant date.\n      <\/para>\n    <\/listitem>\n    <listitem>\n      <para>\n        The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\n        this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement\n        modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all\n        notices&rdquo;.\n      <\/para>\n    <\/listitem>\n    <listitem>\n      <para>\n        You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\n        anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore\n        apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the\n        whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are\n        packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any\n        other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n        separately received it.\n      <\/para>\n    <\/listitem>\n    <listitem>\n      <para>\n        If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need\n        not make them do so.\n      <\/para>\n    <\/listitem>\n  <\/orderedlist>\n  <para>\n    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,\n    which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are\n    not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if\n    the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access\n    or legal rights of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works\n    permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause\n    this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    6.
