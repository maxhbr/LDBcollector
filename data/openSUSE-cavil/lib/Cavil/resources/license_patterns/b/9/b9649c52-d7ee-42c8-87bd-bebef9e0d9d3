For legal entities,\r\n   the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are\r\n   controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered\r\n   to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\"\r\n   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\r\n   management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)\r\n   ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)\r\n   beneficial ownership of such entity.  \"Contribution\" shall mean any original\r\n   work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing\r\n   work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Leads for\r\n   inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products managed or maintained\r\n   by the Project Leads (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition,\r\n   \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication\r\n   sent to the Project Leads or their representatives, including but not\r\n   limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control\r\n   systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,\r\n   the Project Leads for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\r\n   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated\r\n   in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n2.
