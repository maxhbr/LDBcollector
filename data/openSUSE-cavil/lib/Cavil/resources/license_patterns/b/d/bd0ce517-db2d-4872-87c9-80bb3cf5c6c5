For legal entities, the entity making a\r\n   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled\r\n   by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to\r\n   be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,\r\n   \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\r\n   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\r\n   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\r\n   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n   \"Contribution\" shall mean any original work of authorship,\r\n   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that\r\n   is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion\r\n   in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by\r\n   the Project (the \"Work\").
