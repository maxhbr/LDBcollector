Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative \r\nCommons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties \r\nregarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative \r\nCommons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\r\n\r\n### Using Creative Commons Public Licenses\r\n\r\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders \r\nmay use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified \r\nin the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and \r\ndo not form part of our licenses.\r\n\r\n* __Considerations for licensors:__ Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public \r\npermission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. \r\nLicensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors \r\nshould also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. \r\nLicensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or \r\nmaterial used under an exception or limitation to copyright. [More considerations for licensors](http:\/\/wiki.creativecommons.org\/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors).\r\n\r\n* __Considerations for the public:__ By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to \r\nuse the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for \r\nany reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated \r\nby the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority \r\nto grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright \r\nor other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or \r\ndescribed. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions \r\nor stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\n\r\n### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions\r\n\r\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly \r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nb.
