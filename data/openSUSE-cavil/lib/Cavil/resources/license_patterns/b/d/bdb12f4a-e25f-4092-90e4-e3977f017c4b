PREAMBLE\n\n     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n     functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\n     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\n     with or without modifying it, either commercially or\n     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the\n     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not\n     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n     This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\n     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.\n     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n     license designed for free software.\n\n     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for\n     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a\n     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms\n     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to\n     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless\n     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.\n     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n     instruction or reference.\n\n  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,\n     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it\n     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice\n     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,\n     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The\n     \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member\n     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You\n     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a\n     way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n     A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\n     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"bdb12f4a-e25f-4092-90e4-e3977f017c4b"}
