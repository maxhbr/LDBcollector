{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL-Unspecified","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"LGPL license.\r\n\r\nIn an environment where GStreamer libraries and plugins are used as\r\ndynamically-loaded shared objects (DLL\/.so\/.dyn files), this is usually\r\nnot a big problem, because it is fairly easy to compile a modified version\r\nof the GStreamer libraries or LGPL plugins, and the application will\/should\r\njust pick up and use the modified version automatically. All that is needed\r\nis for the original, LGPL-licensed source code and source code modifications\r\nto be made available, and for a way to build the libraries or plugins for\r\nthe platform required (usually that will be using the build system scripts\r\nthat come with GStreamer, and using the typical build environment on the\r\nsystem in question, but where that is not the case the needed build scripts\r\nand\/or tools would need to be provided as well).\r\n\r\n\r\n   IV. THINGS YOU NEED TO DO\r\n\r\n  * You must tell users of your application that you are using LGPL-licensed\r\n    software, which LGPL-licensed software exactly, and you must provide them\r\n    with a copy of the license so they know their rights under the LGPL.\r\n\r\n  * You must provide (on request) all the source code and all the changes\r\n    or additions you have made to the LGPL-licensed software you are using.\r\n\r\n    For GStreamer code we would recommend that the changes be provided either\r\n    in form of a branch in a git repository, or as a set of \"git format-patch\"-\r\n    style patches against a GStreamer release or a snapshot of a GStreamer git\r\n    repository. The patches should ideally say what was changed and why it\r\n    was changed, and there should ideally be separate patches for independent\r\n    changes.\r\n\r\n  * You must provide a way for users of your application to make changes to\r\n    the LGPL-licensed parts of the code, and re-create a full application\r\n    binary with the changes (using the standard toolchain and tools of the\r\n    target platform; if you are using a custom toolchain or custom tools\r\n    you must provide these and document how to use them to create a new\r\n    application binary).\r\n\r\n    Note that this of course does not mean that the user is allowed to\r\n    re-distribute the changed application. Nor does it mean that you have\r\n    to provide your proprietary source code - it is sufficient to provide a\r\n    ready-made compiled object file that can be relinked into an application\r\n    binary with the re-compiled LGPL components.\r\n\r\n\r\n   V. THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR\r\n\r\nWhile most GStreamer plugins and the libraries they depend on are licensed\r\nunder the LGPL or even more permissive licenses, that is not the case for\r\nall plugins and libraries used, esp. those in the gst-plugins-ugly or\r\nsome of those in the gst-plugins-bad set of plugins.\r\n\r\nWhen statically linking proprietary code, care must be taken not to\r\nstatically link plugins or libraries that are licensed under less permissive\r\nterms than the LGPL, such as e.g. GPL-licensed libraries","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b7291d77-5c49-4bbe-b873-eb2f6430cb6d"}
