By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,\nuse the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\napplies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n\n   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n\n   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,\nreceive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these\nterms so they know their rights.\n\n   <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\n\n   <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n   <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. \nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\n   <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. \nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n<h3 class=\"heading\">TERMS AND CONDITIONS<\/h3>\n\n     <ol type=1 start=0>\n<li>Definitions.\n\n     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and\n&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.\n\n     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of\nthe earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\n     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n     <li>Source Code.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form\nof a work.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n     <li>Basic Permissions.\n\n     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. \nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n          <ol type=a start=1>\n<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,\nand giving a relevant date.\n\n          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\nunder this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This\nrequirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all\nnotices&rdquo;.\n\n          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\nanyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will\ntherefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,\nto the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they\nare packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in\nany other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\nseparately received it.\n\n          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work\nneed not make them do so.\n          <\/ol>\n\n     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n          <ol type=a start=1>\n<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\nused for software interchange.\n\n          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written\noffer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you\noffer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give\nanyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the\nCorresponding Source for all the software in the product that is\ncovered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\nfor software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable\ncost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access\nto copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\noffer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is\nallowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you\nreceived the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\n6b.\n\n          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy\nthe object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be\non a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\nequivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\nnext to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. \nRegardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain\nobligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\nsatisfy these requirements.\n\n          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\ninform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of\nthe work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\nsubsection 6d.\n\n          <\/ol>\n\n     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,\n&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\n     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\n     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n     <li>Additional Terms.\n\n     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. \nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n          <ol type=a start=1>\n<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms\nof sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\nattributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices\ndisplayed by works containing it; or\n\n          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\n          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\nnames, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by\nanyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\ncontractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any\nliability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those\nlicensors and authors.\n          <\/ol>\n\n     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further\nrestrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n     <li>Termination.\n\n     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\n     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n     <li>Patents.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.\n\n     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey\na covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree\nto terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n     <li>Revised Versions of this License.\n\n     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

Secondarily,\nthis License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\ncredit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodifications made by others.\n\n     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\n     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\nunder the terms of this License.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below, refers to any\nsuch manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.\n\n     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\nnot &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.\n\n     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\nPostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\nby proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\npurposes only.\n\n     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     <li>VERBATIM COPYING\n\n     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n     <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\nand the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. \nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\n     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\ncharge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\nthe public.\n\n     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     <li>MODIFICATIONS\n\n     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n     <p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br>\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).<br>\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.<br>\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br>\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br>\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br>\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.<br>\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br>\nI. Preserve the section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, and its title, and add to\n   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br>\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. \n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br>\nK. In any section entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,\n   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\n   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and\/or dedications given therein.<br>\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<br>\nM. Delete any section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.<br>\nN. Do not retitle any existing section as &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br>\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. \nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n     <p>You may add a section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties&ndash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\n     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n     <pre class=\"sp\">\n     \n     <\/pre>\n     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice.\n\n     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. \nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;\nin the various original documents, forming one section entitled\n&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\nand any sections entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.
