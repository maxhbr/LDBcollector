It is copyrighted and there are\nrestrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed\nto permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.\nWhat is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing\nany version of this program that they might get from you.\n\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of @pspp{}, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change these programs or use pieces of\nthem in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of @pspp{}, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds\nout that there is no warranty for @pspp{}.  If these programs are\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to\nknow that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any\nproblems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise conditions of the license for @pspp{} are found in the\nGNU General Public License.
