{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0 WITH Linking-exception","packname":"virtualbox","patent":0,"pattern":"1) The majority of code in the VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is<br>\ncopyrighted by Oracle Corporation. This code is combined with third-party code<br>\nthat was originally released under licenses which the Free Software Foundation<br>\nconsiders incompatible with the GPL, such as the Apache License 2.0, the OpenSSL<br>\nlicense, the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and the Slirp license. (Please see the<br>\nVirtualBox User Manual for a complete list of third-party code and their<br>\nlicenses.) As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the GPL listed<br>\nbelow, Oracle gives you explicit permission to combine its GPL code contained in<br>\nVirtualBox OSE with third-party code under the aforementioned licenses. You may<br>\ncopy and distribute such a combination provided that you adhere to the terms and<br>\nconditions of all of the GPL and the licenses of the third-party code; in<br>\nparticular, you must include the source code of the entire combination insofar<br>\nas the GPL requires distribution of source code.<br>\n<br>\n2) The GPL listed below does not bind software which uses VirtualBox services by<br>\nmerely linking to VirtualBox libraries so long as all VirtualBox interfaces used<br>\nby that software are multi-licensed. A VirtualBox interface is deemed<br>\nmulti-licensed if it is declared in a VirtualBox header file that is licensed<br>\nunder both the GPL version 2 (below) *and* the Common Development and<br>\nDistribution License Version 1.0 (CDDL), as it comes in the &quot;COPYING.CDDL&quot; file.<br>\nIn other words, calling such a multi-licensed interface is merely considered<br>\nnormal use of VirtualBox and does not turn the calling code into a derived work<br>\nof VirtualBox. In particular, this applies to code that wants to extend<br>\nVirtualBox by way of the Extension Pack mechanism declared in the ExtPack.h<br>\nheader file.<br>\n<br>\n3) Whoever creates or distributes a derived work based on VirtualBox OSE is not<br>\nobligated to grant the above exceptions for such a version. The GPL allows for<br>\nreleasing a modified version without the above exception; in addition, Oracle<br>\nhereby also allows you to release a modified version which carries forward these<br>\nexceptions.<br","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"40135a5b-6089-4f5e-9b82-783719a51c00"}
