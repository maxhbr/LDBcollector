Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\n is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non\n  transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional\n  license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in\n   all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n   applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any\n   current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\n   purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\n   promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective\n   as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of\n   the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\n   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\n   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\n   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\n   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\n    and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\n    Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4.
