DEFINITIONS\r\n *\r\n * \"Contribution\" means:\r\n *\r\n *   a. in the case of Lucent Technologies Inc. (\"LUCENT\"), the Original\r\n *      Program, and\r\n *   b. in the case of each Contributor,\r\n *\r\n *      i. changes to the Program, and\r\n *     ii. additions to the Program;\r\n *\r\n *     where such changes and\/or additions to the Program were added to the\r\n *     Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\r\n *     Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in\r\n *     accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and\/or\r\n *     additions as Contributions.\r\n *\r\n * \"Contributor\" means LUCENT and any other entity that has Contributed a\r\n * Contribution to the Program.\r\n *\r\n * \"Distributor\" means a Recipient that distributes the Program,\r\n * modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.\r\n *\r\n * \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\r\n * which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\r\n * alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n *\r\n * \"Original Program\" means the original version of the software\r\n * accompanying this Agreement as released by LUCENT, including source\r\n * code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n *\r\n * \"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part\r\n * thereof\r\n *\r\n * \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\r\n * Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n *\r\n * 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n *\r\n *  a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\n *     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\r\n *     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\r\n *     publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\r\n *     Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\r\n *     object code form.\r\n *\r\n *  b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\n *     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\r\n *     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\r\n *     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if\r\n *     any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted\r\n *     by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the\r\n *     Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the\r\n *     Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\r\n *     Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed\r\n *     Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply\r\n *     to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to\r\n *     (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is\r\n *     licensed hereunder.\r\n *\r\n *  c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\n *     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\r\n *     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\r\n *     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\r\n *     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\r\n *     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\r\n *     or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\r\n *     granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\r\n *     to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\r\n *     example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\r\n *     Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\r\n *     to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n *\r\n *  d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\r\n *     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\r\n *     license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n *\r\n * 3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n *\r\n * A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under\r\n * this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n *\r\n *  a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\r\n *\r\n *  b. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible\r\n *     form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement\r\n *     is included with each copy of the Program; and\r\n *\r\n *  c. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such\r\n *     license agreement:\r\n *\r\n *       i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\r\n *          and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\r\n *          conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\r\n *          conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n *      ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\r\n *          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\r\n *          consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\r\n *     iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\r\n *          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\r\n *\r\n * B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous\r\n *    location in the Program:\r\n *\r\n *    Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All Rights\r\n *    Reserved.\r\n *\r\n * C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the\r\n * originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows\r\n * subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n * Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and\/or changes\r\n * are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed,\r\n * it may not thereafter be revoked.\r\n *\r\n * 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n *\r\n * Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\r\n * responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\r\n * like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\r\n * of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a\r\n * commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\r\n * create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a\r\n * Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\r\n * such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend\r\n * and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against\r\n * any losses, damages and costs (collectively\"Losses\") arising from\r\n * claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\r\n * against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\r\n * or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its\r\n * distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\r\n * obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\r\n * relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\r\n * In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\r\n * notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b)\r\n * allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the\r\n * Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement\r\n * negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\r\n * claim at its own expense.\r\n *\r\n * For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial\r\n * product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial\r\n * Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance\r\n * claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\r\n * claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility\r\n * alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to\r\n * defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance\r\n * claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay\r\n * any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those\r\n * damages.\r\n *\r\n * 5. NO WARRANTY\r\n *\r\n * EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\r\n * PROVIDED ON AN\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\r\n * KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\r\n * WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\r\n * OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\r\n * responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\r\n * distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\r\n * exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\r\n * the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\r\n * laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\r\n * unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n *\r\n * 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n *\r\n * EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\r\n * ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\r\n * INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\r\n * WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\r\n * LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\r\n * NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\r\n * DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\r\n * HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n *\r\n * 7. EXPORT CONTROL\r\n *\r\n * Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance\r\n * with the United States export administration regulations (and the\r\n * export control laws and regulation of any other countries).\r\n *\r\n * 8. GENERAL\r\n *\r\n * If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n * applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\n * the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\r\n * action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\r\n * minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n *\r\n * If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\r\n * respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\r\n * counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\r\n * Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\r\n * of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\r\n * institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n * cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\r\n * itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\r\n * hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\r\n * rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\r\n * litigation is filed.\r\n *\r\n * All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\r\n * fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\r\n * Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\r\n * time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\r\n * rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\r\n * and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n * However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\r\n * granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\r\n * survive.\r\n *\r\n * LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this\r\n * Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be\r\n * given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\r\n * Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\r\n * Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new\r\n * version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to\r\n * distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\r\n * version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this\r\n * Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\r\n * Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property\r\n * of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by\r\n * implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\r\n * expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n *\r\n * This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\r\n * the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\r\n * party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\r\n * more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives\r\n * its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation","risk":3,"spdx":"LPL-1.02","trademark":0,"unique_id":"4ee0e014-203c-423a-aa42-d16dd85e543b"}
