Accordingly, when a\r\nParty (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential Information from the other\r\nParty (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such\r\ninformation to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall\r\ncause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all\r\nConfidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential\r\nInformation to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written\r\napproval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential\r\nInformation for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling\r\nits responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take\r\nreasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party,\r\nwhich measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to\r\nprotect its own confidential and proprietary information. Obligation of\r\nconfidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally\r\nknown to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was\r\nin the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and\r\nwas not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed\r\nindependently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other\r\npersons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the\r\nConfidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written\r\nrecords of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving\r\nParty without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of\r\nconfidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in\r\nwhich case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such\r\ncompelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the\r\ninformation and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of\r\ndisclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the\r\nminimum extent necessary. The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to\r\nremain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and,\r\nwith respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected\r\nunder applicable trade secret laws.\r\n\r\n10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT\r\n10.1 License Fees\r\nLicense Fees are described in The Qt Company’s standard price list, quote or\r\nPurchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be. The\r\nLicense Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for\r\nany reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\n10.2 Ordering Licenses\r\nLicensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to\r\nagreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at\r\nThe Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.\r\nLicensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and\r\nDistribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable\r\nto The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a “Purchase Order”)\r\nfor confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the\r\nParties.\r\n\r\n10.3 Distribution License Packs\r\nUnless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of\r\nDistribution License Packs. Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License\r\nPack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available\r\nfor installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly “installing”) the\r\nRedistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the\r\nRedistributables in accordance with this Agreement. Each time Licensee\r\n“installs” or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution\r\nLicense is used, and Licensee’s account of available Distribution Licenses is\r\ndecreased accordingly. Licensee may “install” copies of the Redistributables so\r\nlong as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.\r\nRedistributables will be deemed to have been “installed” into a Device when one\r\nof the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have\r\nbeen loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee’s premises or b)\r\nthe Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold)\r\nfor the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more\r\nthan one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation\r\nwhere a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a\r\ndistributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up\r\ncopy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the\r\nproduct, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have\r\nbeen “installed” and will not require an additional Distribution License.\r\n\r\n10.4 Payment Terms\r\nLicense Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by\r\nLicensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice\r\nfrom The Qt Company. The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the\r\ndate of this Agreement and\/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order\r\nfrom Licensee. A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month;\r\nor (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any\r\nunpaid balances that remain past due. The Qt Company shall have the right to\r\nsuspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software\r\nhereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution\r\nLicense, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.\r\n\r\n10.5 Taxes\r\nAll License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but\r\nexclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or\r\ntariffs (“Taxes”). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where\r\napplicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an\r\nexemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.\r\n\r\n11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS\r\n11.1 Licensee’s Record-keeping\r\nLicensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of\r\nLicensee’s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution\r\nof Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee’s\r\ncompliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number\r\nof Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records\r\nshall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt\r\nCompany. Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company’s\r\nrequest to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee’s usage\r\nof Licensed Software, such report to contain information, in sufficient detail,\r\non (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of\r\nRedistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii)\r\nnumber of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of\r\nunused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee’s account, and (iv) any other\r\ninformation as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.\r\n\r\n11.2. The Qt Company’s Audit Rights\r\nThe Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company’s,\r\nmay, upon at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice and at its\r\nexpense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not\r\nmore frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be\r\nconducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee’s\r\nplace of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular\r\nbusiness hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere\r\nwith Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor\r\nacting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee’s\r\nRecords. All such Licensee’s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an\r\nobligation of confidentiality under this Agreement. If an audit reveals that\r\nLicensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee\r\nhas paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed\r\nfor such unauthorized use.\r\nIn addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of\r\nthis Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be\r\ndeemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee\r\nshall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.\r\n\r\n12 TERM AND TERMINATION\r\n12.1 Term\r\nThis Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and\r\nremain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force\r\n(“Term”), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.\r\n\r\n12.2 Termination by The Qt Company\r\nThe Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)\r\ndays prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any\r\nobligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate\r\nEither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon\r\nwritten notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for\r\nany form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a\r\nreceiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a\r\nsubstantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent\r\nto any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n12.4 Parties´ Rights and Duties upon Termination\r\nUpon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause\r\nall Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates’ and Contractors’) to\r\ncease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under\r\nthis Agreement.\r\nNotwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:\r\n(i)  as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development\r\n     License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed\r\n     by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity\r\n     under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase\r\n     additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or\r\n(ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or\r\n     pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of\r\n     six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue\r\n     distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at\r\n     such effective date of termination.

Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of\r\nCustomers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated\r\nRedistributables).\r\n\r\n12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy\r\nIn the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable\r\ndecision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of\r\nexpiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party,\r\nwho has assumed The Qt Company’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed\r\nSoftware under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee\r\nat such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry,\r\nshall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n13.

For\r\n   clarity, License for distribution of Devices pursuant to Section 3.3 is\r\n   subject to applicable License Fee for necessary Distribution Licenses;\r\n - Development License under Section 3.1 is limited to a maximum of three (3)\r\n   Designated Users; and\r\n - Support is available subject to availability, as judged by The Qt Company at\r\n   its free and absolute discretion.\r\n\r\nUpon expiry of the Trial Term:\r\n a) This Appendix 4 is terminated, Trial Term Modifications cease to remain in\r\n    force, Licensee’s Development Licenses shall be automatically converted into\r\n    licenses subject to a License Fee (in the amount specified in the quote or\r\n    in Appendix 2 and payable with a 30-day payment term) and Licensee’s rights\r\n    and obligations under this Agreement shall continue to remain in force under\r\n    the standard provisions of the Agreement, unless the Licensee notifies The\r\n    Qt Company in writing no less than ninety (90) days before such expiry date\r\n    that Licensee does not agree to such continuance, in which event the\r\n    Agreement, and all rights of the Licensee thereunder, shall expire; provided\r\n    however that\r\n b) in the event the Licensee still qualifies as a Start-up Company, the\r\n    Licensee has an option (“Option”), instead of what is stated in item a)\r\n    above, to extend the Trial Term renewal is limited to one time and total\r\n    duration of Trial Terms thus to 24 months after the effective date. Licensee\r\n    shall notify The Qt Company in writing no less than ninety (90) days before\r\n    the expiry date, if Licensee wish to exercise the Option.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 5: NON-COMMERCIAL USE APPENDIX\r\nThe provisions of this Appendix 5 are applicable for non-commercial use of the\r\nLicensed Software by the Licensee.\r\nFor the purpose of this Appendix 5, the following additional definitions\r\n(replacing the relevant definition of the Agreement, where applicable) shall be\r\napplicable:\r\n “Demo Units” shall mean (i) hardware development platform, which incorporates\r\n the Licensed Software along with Licensee’s software and\/or hardware, and\r\n (ii) prototype versions of Applications or Devices.\r\n “Designated User(s)” shall mean the employees and students of the Licensee.\r\n “Licensee Products” shall mean Applications and\/or Devices.\r\n “Permitted Purpose” shall mean (i) Licensee’s internal evaluation and testing\r\n of Licensed Software, (ii) building Demo Units as well as (iii) educational\r\n use.\r\n “Term” shall mean a period of twelve (12) months or any such other period as\r\n may be agreed between the Parties.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this Appendix 5, the following changes shall be agreed with\r\nrespect to relevant Sections of the Agreement:\r\n I.   Recital (A) shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows: “(A)\r\n      Licensee wishes to use the Licensed Software for the Permitted Purpose.”\r\n II.  Section 3.1 shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows:\r\n      “The Qt Company grants to Licensee a personal, non-exclusive,\r\n      non-transferable, revocable, royalty-free license, valid for the Term, to\r\n      use, modify and copy the Licensed Software solely for the Permitted\r\n      Purpose. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an\r\n      unlimited number of computers provided that only Designated Users may use\r\n      the Licensed Software. Licensee may demonstrate the Demo Units, provided\r\n      that such demonstrations must be conducted by Licensee, and the Demo Units\r\n      must remain in Licensee’s possession and under Licensee’s control at all\r\n      times. For clarity, this Agreement does not (i) entitle Licensee to use\r\n      Licensed Software to create Applications or Devices (other than prototypes\r\n      thereof) or (ii) carry any distribution rights to Licensee, but such\r\n      rights are subject to and conditional upon conclusion of a separate\r\n      license agreement with The Qt Company.”\r\n III. Sections 3.2, 3.3, 8 and 10 shall be deleted.\r\n IV.

Licensee shall be responsible for any\r\n         and all actions and omissions of its Designated Users relating to the\r\n         Licensed Software and use thereof. Any use of Licensed Software beyond\r\n         the provisions of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and requires an\r\n         additional license from The Qt Company.”\r\n V.   Section 12 shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows:\r\n      “This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties\r\n      and remain in force for the Term, unless and until terminated pursuant to\r\n      the terms of Section 12. Upon termination of the Agreement, Licensee shall\r\n      cease using the Licensed Software. All other copies of Licensed Software\r\n      in the possession or control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed. An\r\n      officer of Licensee must, upon request, promptly deliver to The Qt Company\r\n      a written confirmation that this has occurred.”\r\n\r\nExcept for the modifications specified above, this Appendix carries no change to\r\nthe terms of the Agreement which shall remain in full force","risk":5,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"467d9b1c-d3ba-49f0-a24a-eed8cc49ab12"}
