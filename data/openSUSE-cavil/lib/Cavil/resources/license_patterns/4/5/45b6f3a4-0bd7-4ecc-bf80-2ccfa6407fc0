QPL was the former\r\nlicense of the graphical toolkit Qt, but that license is not supported by any\r\nmajor free software project. Furthermore, the terms of the LGPLv2 license are\r\nambiguous for a library of C++ templates, like CGAL.\r\n\r\nThe CGAL project, driven by the CGAL Editorial Board, has decided to change the\r\nlicense scheme of CGAL. We increased the major number of the CGAL version to\r\n'4' in order to reflect this license change.
