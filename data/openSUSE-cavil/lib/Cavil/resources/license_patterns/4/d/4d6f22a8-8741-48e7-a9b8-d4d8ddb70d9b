{"export_restricted":0,"license":"XPDF","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version\n2.  In my opinion, the GPL is a convoluted, confusing, ambiguous mess.\nBut it's also pervasive, and I'm sick of arguing.  And even if it is\nconfusing, the basic idea is good.\n\nIn order to cut down on the confusion a little bit, here are some\ninformal clarifications:\n\n- I don't mind if you redistribute Xpdf in source and\/or binary form,\n  as long as you include all of the documentation: README, man pages\n  (or help files), and COPYING.  (Note that the README file contains a\n  pointer to a web page with the source code.)\n\n- Selling a CD-ROM that contains Xpdf is fine with me, as long as it\n  includes the documentation.  I wouldn't mind receiving a sample\n  copy, but it's not necessary.\n\n- If you make useful changes to Xpdf, please make the source code\n  available -- post it on a web site, email it to me, whatever","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"4d6f22a8-8741-48e7-a9b8-d4d8ddb70d9b"}
