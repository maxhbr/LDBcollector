{"export_restricted":0,"license":"gutenberg","packname":"dmd","patent":0,"pattern":"The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\r\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\r\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\r\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\r\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\r\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text\r\nfiles per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end\r\nof the year 2001.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg\/IBC\", and are\r\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law (\"IBC\" is Illinois\r\nBenedictine College).
