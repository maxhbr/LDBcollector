{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.3","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"4. MODIFICATIONS\n----------------\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\nModified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version\nfilling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and\nmodification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.\nIn addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n  1. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n     of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version\n     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n  2. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of\n     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than\n     five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n  3. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified\n     Version, as the publisher.\n\n  4. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n  5. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n     adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n  6. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n  7. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant\n     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license\n     notice.\n\n  8. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n  9. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and\n     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,\n     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.\n     If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create\n     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the\n     Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing\n     the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n 10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n     it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n 11. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n     and\/or dedications given therein.\n\n 12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in\n     their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent\n     are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n 13. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not\n     be included in the Modified Version.\n\n 14. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n 15. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties --\nfor example, statements of peer review or that the text has been\napproved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and\na passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the\nlist of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through\narrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes\na cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by\narrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you\nmay not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this\nLicense give permission to use their names for publicity for or to\nassert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n----------------------\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant\nSections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n---------------------------\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n-------------------------------------\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of\nthe compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When\nthe Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply\nto the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative\nworks of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n--------------\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\nInvariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\ntheir copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\nInvariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these\nInvariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and\nall the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,\nprovided that you also include the original English version of this\nLicense and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\ncase of a disagreement between the translation and the original version\nof this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\nprevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n--------------\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License.\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n------------------------------------\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns. See Copyleft\n(http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/).\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version\nnumber. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of\nthis License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option\nof following the terms and conditions either of that specified version\nor of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies\nthat a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be\nused, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version\npermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n---------------\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public\nwiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive\nMultiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any\nset of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n   \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit\ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\npublished by that same organization.\n\n   \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or\nin part, as part of another Document.\n\n   An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this\nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License\nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole\nor in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,\nand (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\n   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the\nsite under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"41dc8f1e-a949-4e28-8631-b0ba325ca504"}
