Guido remains Python's principal author,\nalthough it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National\nResearch Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us\/) in Reston,\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to\nform the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs\nteam moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see\nhttp:\/\/www.zope.com\/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttp:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a non-profit organization created\nspecifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a\nsponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/ for the Open\nSource Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also\nbeen GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"4142823c-3d3b-48da-8d32-da698dec3356"}
