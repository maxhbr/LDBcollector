Likewise for a collection of short\ndocuments--you only need one copy of the GNU FDL for the whole\ncollection.  For a single short document, you can use a very permissive\nnon-copyleft license, to avoid taking up space with a long license.\n\n   See `http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl-howto.html' for more explanation\nof how to employ the GFDL.\n\n   Note that it is not obligatory to include a copy of the GNU GPL or\nGNU LGPL in a manual whose license is neither the GPL nor the LGPL.  It\ncan be a good idea to include the program's license in a large manual;\nin a short manual, whose size would be increased considerably by\nincluding the program's license, it is probably better not to include\nit.\n\n\u001f\nFile: standards.info,  Node: Manual Credits,  Next: Printed Manuals,  Prev: License for Manuals,  Up: Documentation\n\n6.5 Manual Credits\n==================\n\nPlease credit the principal human writers of the manual as the authors,\non the title page of the manual.
