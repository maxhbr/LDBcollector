Most commonly this is\n *   accomplished by including a link to the Harvest Home Page\n *   (http:\/\/harvest.cs.colorado.edu\/) from the query page of any\n *   Broker you deploy, as well as in the query result pages.  These\n *   links are generated automatically by the standard Broker\n *   software distribution.\n *   \n *   The Harvest software is provided ``as is'', without express or\n *   implied warranty, and with no support nor obligation to assist\n *   in its use, correction, modification or enhancement.

In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now\n *   allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in\n *   the Harvest ``src\/'' directory) for free.  We made this change\n *   in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of\n *   the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference\n *   implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which\n *   we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial\n *   re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"801eea15-7c70-498a-ac00-4348c00c59d6"}
