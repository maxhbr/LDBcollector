Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed \r\nincompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others. \r\nFor example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache \r\nLicense, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed \r\nto you under their original licenses. \r\n\r\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the \r\nClasspath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits \r\nyou to use that code in combination with other independent modules not \r\nlicensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to \r\ncommingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed \r\ncode by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also \r\ncontaining Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the \r\nfiles to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be \r\nrequired to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under \r\nthe GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms \r\nof some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath \r\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further \r\ndistribute the package. \r\n\r\nFailing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create \r\nunexpected legal consequences.\r\n \r\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer \r\nskilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or \r\nmaking modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed \r\nand\/or involve the use of third party software","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"8a74bf15-f9aa-4f26-8ff6-8c09d9db865d"}
