We feel that the license encourages contributors to pick up the\nsource and work with it, and believe that those individuals and organizations\nwill contribute back their work if they do not want to have to maintain a fork\nforever (which is time consuming and expensive when merges are involved).\nFurther, nobody makes money on compilers these days, but many people need them\nto get bigger goals accomplished: it makes sense for everyone to work\ntogether.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the LLVM\/clang license, please see the <a \nhref=\"http:\/\/llvm.org\/docs\/DeveloperPolicy.html#license\">LLVM License \nDescription<\/a> for more information","risk":1,"spdx":"BSD-3-Clause","trademark":0,"unique_id":"8a6d8ca8-7726-4101-ab63-fc77fdf65e7c"}
