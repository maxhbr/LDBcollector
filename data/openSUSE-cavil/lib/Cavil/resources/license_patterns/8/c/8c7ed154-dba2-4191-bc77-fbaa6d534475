From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms,\r\nprovided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support\r\nprovided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the\r\nLicensee.

CONFIDENTIALITY\r\nEach Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may\r\nreceive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business\r\nplans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information,\r\nincluding the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value\r\nto the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if\r\ndisclosed to third parties (“Confidential Information”). Accordingly, when a\r\nParty (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential Information from the other\r\nParty (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such\r\ninformation to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall\r\ncause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all\r\nConfidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential\r\nInformation to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written\r\napproval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential\r\nInformation for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling\r\nits responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take\r\nreasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party,\r\nwhich measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to\r\nprotect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of\r\nconfidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally\r\nknown to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was\r\nin the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and\r\nwas not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed\r\nindependently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other\r\npersons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the\r\nConfidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written\r\nrecords of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving\r\nParty without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of\r\nconfidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in\r\nwhich case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such\r\ncompelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the\r\ninformation and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of\r\ndisclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the\r\nminimum extent necessary.\r\n\r\nThe obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a\r\nperiod of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade\r\nsecrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade\r\nsecret laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT\r\n\r\n10.1 License Fees\r\nLicense Fees are described in The Qt Company’s standard price list, quote or\r\nPurchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.

Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution\r\nLicense Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses\r\navailable for distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this\r\nAgreement.  Each time Licensee distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one\r\nDistribution License is used, and Licensee’s account of available Distribution\r\nLicenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may distribute copies of the\r\nRedistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n10.4 Payment Terms\r\nLicense Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by\r\nLicensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice\r\nfrom The Qt Company.

Such applicable\r\nTaxes shall be paid by Licensee to The Qt Company, or, where applicable, in lieu\r\nof payment of such Taxes to The Qt Company, Licensee shall provide an exemption\r\ncertificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.\r\n\r\n11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS\r\n\r\n11.1 Licensee’s Record-keeping\r\nLicensee shall at all times during the Term of this Agreement and for a period\r\nof seven (7) years thereafter maintain Licensee’s Records in an accurate and\r\nup-to-date form.  Licensee’s Records shall be adequate to reasonably enable The\r\nQt Company to determine Licensee’s compliance with the provisions of this\r\nAgreement. The records shall conform to general good accounting practices.\r\nLicensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company’s request\r\nto that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report based on Licensee’s Records,\r\nsuch report to contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) number and\r\nidentity of users working with Licensed Software or Open Source Qt, (ii) copies\r\nof Redistributables distributed by Licensee during the most recent calendar\r\nquarter and\/or any other term specified by The Qt Company, (iii) number of\r\nundistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused\r\nDistribution Licenses remaining on Licensee’s account, and (iv) any other\r\ninformation as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.\r\n\r\n11.2. The Qt Company’s Audit Rights\r\nThe Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company’s,\r\nmay, upon at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice and at its\r\nexpense, audit Licensee with respect to the Licensee’s use of the Licensed\r\nSoftware, but not more frequently than once during each 6- month period. Such\r\naudit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit\r\nto Licensee’s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted\r\nduring regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not\r\nunreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or\r\nthe independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to\r\ninspect Licensee’s Records and conduct necessary interviews of Licensee’s\r\nrelevant employees and Contractors. All such Licensee’s Records and use thereof\r\nshall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If\r\nan audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of\r\nthe licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to pay The Qt Company any\r\namounts owed for such unauthorized use within 30 days from receipt of the\r\ncorresponding invoice from The Qt Company.  In addition, in the event the audit\r\nreveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (without limitation,\r\neither (i) underpayment of more than 10 % of License Fees or 10,000 euros\r\n(whichever is more) or (ii) distribution of products, which include or result\r\nfrom Prohibited Combination, shall be deemed a material violation for purposes\r\nof this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost\r\nof conducting such audit.\r\n\r\n\r\n12 TERM AND TERMINATION\r\n\r\n12.1 Agreement Term\r\nThis Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and\r\nremain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) purchased\r\nunder this Agreement in force (“Term”), unless and until terminated pursuant to\r\nthe terms of this Section 12.\r\n\r\n12.2 Termination and suspension of rights\r\nEither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)\r\ndays prior written notice if the other Party commits a material breach of any\r\nobligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice\r\nperiod.  Instead of termination, The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend\r\nor withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including\r\nbut not limited to the Development Licenses, Distribution License, and Support,\r\nshould Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violates or\r\nis reasonably suspected to violate its obligations or terms of this Agreement,\r\nand where such violation or breach is not cured within five (5) business days\r\nfollowing The Qt Company’s written notice thereof.\r\n\r\n12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate\r\nEither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon\r\nwritten notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for\r\nany form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a\r\nreceiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a\r\nsubstantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent\r\nto any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n12.4 Parties´ Rights and Duties upon Termination\r\nUpon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause\r\nall Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates’ and Contractors’) to\r\ncease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under\r\nthis Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires\r\nor is terminated:\r\n   (i)   as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development\r\n         License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses\r\n         possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid\r\n         in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is\r\n         entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section\r\n         10.2; or\r\n   (ii)  for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or\r\n         pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period\r\n         of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue\r\n         distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but\r\n         unused at such effective date of termination.\r\n\r\nUpon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company\r\nall copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify\r\nthe same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may\r\nretain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably\r\nrequire in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of\r\nthis Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its\r\nobligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to\r\nthe effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt\r\nCompany all such fees upon the effective date of termination. Termination of\r\nthis Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of\r\nApplications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).\r\n\r\n12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy\r\nIn the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable\r\ndecision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of\r\nexpiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party,\r\nwho has assumed The Qt Company’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed\r\nSoftware under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee\r\nat such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry,\r\nshall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.

Licensee shall be\r\n            responsible for any and all actions and omissions of its Designated\r\n            Users relating to the Licensed Software and use thereof.  Any use\r\n            of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is\r\n            strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Qt\r\n            Company.”\r\n   V.   Section 12 shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows: “This\r\n        Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties\r\n        and remain in force for the Term, unless and until terminated pursuant\r\n        to the terms of Section 12.
