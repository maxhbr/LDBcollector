Governed\nfiles are licensed under the GPL.  The portions of them owned by Hans\nReiser, or authorized to be licensed by him, have been in the past,\nand likely will be in the future, licensed to other parties under\nother licenses.  If you add your code to governed files, and don't\nwant it to be owned by Hans Reiser, put your copyright label on that\ncode so the poor blight and his customers can keep things straight.\nAll portions of governed files not labeled otherwise are owned by Hans\nReiser, and by adding your code to it, widely distributing it to\nothers or sending us a patch, and leaving the sentence in stating that\nlicensing is governed by the statement in this file, you accept this.\nIt will be a kindness if you identify whether Hans Reiser is allowed\nto license code labeled as owned by you on your behalf other than\nunder the GPL, because he wants to know if it is okay to do so and put\na check in the mail to you (for non-trivial improvements) when he\nmakes his next sale.  He makes no guarantees as to the amount if any,\nthough he feels motivated to motivate contributors, and you can surely\ndiscuss this with him before or after contributing.  You have the\nright to decline to allow him to license your code contribution other\nthan under the GPL.\n\nFurther licensing options are available for commercial and\/or other\ninterests directly from Hans Reiser: reiser@namesys.com.  If you interpret\nthe GPL as not allowing those additional licensing options, you read\nit wrongly, and Richard Stallman agrees with me, when carefully read\nyou can see that those restrictions on additional terms do not apply\nto the owner of the copyright, and my interpretation of this shall\ngovern for this license.  \n\nFinally, nothing in this license shall be interpreted to allow you to\nfail to fairly credit me, or to remove my credits such as by creating\na front end that hides my credits from the user or renaming mkreiser4\nto mkyourcompanyfs or even just make_filesystem, without my\npermission, unless you are an end user not redistributing to others.\nIf you have doubts about how to properly do that, or about what is\nfair, ask.  (Last I spoke with him Richard was contemplating how best\nto address the fair crediting issue in the next GPL version.)\n\nAlso, a clustering file system built to work on top of this file\nsystem shall be considered a derivative work for the purposes of\ninterpreting the GPL license granted herein.  Plugins are also to be\nconsidered derivative works.  Share code or pay money, we give you the\nchoice","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"8c4179b3-1e23-4f78-bf45-b3e376e65336"}
