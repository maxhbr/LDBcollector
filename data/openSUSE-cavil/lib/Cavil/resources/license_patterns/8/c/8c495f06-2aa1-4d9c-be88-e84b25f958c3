PREAMBLE<\/title>\r\n    <para>\r\n      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or\r\n      other written document <quote>free<\/quote> in the sense of\r\n      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and\r\n      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either\r\n      commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License\r\n      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for\r\n      their work, while not being considered responsible for\r\n      modifications made by others.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>\r\n      This License is a kind of <quote>copyleft<\/quote>, which means\r\n      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in\r\n      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,\r\n      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>\r\n      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for\r\n      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a\r\n      free program should come with manuals providing the same\r\n      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited\r\n      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,\r\n      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a\r\n      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works\r\n      whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n  <\/sect1>\r\n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section1\">\r\n    <title>1.

The\r\n      <quote>Document<\/quote>, below, refers to any such manual or\r\n      work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed\r\n      as <quote>you<\/quote>.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para id=\"fdl-modified\">\r\n      A <quote>Modified Version<\/quote> of the Document means any work\r\n      containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied\r\n      verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another\r\n      language.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n\t\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-secondary\">\r\n      A <quote>Secondary Section<\/quote> is a named appendix or a\r\n      front-matter section of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> that deals exclusively\r\n      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the\r\n      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\r\n      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within\r\n      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a\r\n      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\r\n      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\r\n      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of\r\n      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\r\n      regarding them.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-invariant\">\r\n      The <quote>Invariant Sections<\/quote> are certain <link linkend=\"fdl-secondary\"> Secondary Sections<\/link> whose \r\ntitles\r\n      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the\r\n      notice that says that the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> is released under this\r\n      License","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"8c495f06-2aa1-4d9c-be88-e84b25f958c3"}
