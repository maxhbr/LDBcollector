GNU `dbm' (`gdbm') is not in\nthe public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its\ndistribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything\nthat a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed\nis to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of `gdbm'\nthat they might get from you.\n\n   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies `gdbm', that you receive source code or else can get it if\nyou want it, that you can change these functions or use pieces of them\nin new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies `gdbm', you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for anything in the `gdbm'\ndistribution.  If these functions are modified by someone else and\npassed on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not\nwhat we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not\nreflect on our reputation.\n\n   `Gdbm' is currently distributed under the terms of the GNU General\nPublic License, Version 3.
