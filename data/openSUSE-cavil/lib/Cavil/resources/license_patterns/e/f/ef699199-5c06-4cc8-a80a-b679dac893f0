If so, what are they?\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n7.4 Contributors who make regular and substantial contributions may become\r\ncommitters as described below.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/s2>\r\n\r\n<s2 title=\"8 COMMITTERS\" >\r\n<p>\r\n8.1 Each subproject has a set of committers. Committers are \r\ncontributors who have read\/write access to the source code \r\nrepository. \r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n8.2 Normally, a new committer is added after a contributor has\r\nbeen nominated by a committer and approved by at least 50 percent\r\nof the active committers for that subproject with no opposing\r\nvotes.  In the case that a subproject has a very small number of\r\nactive committers, the PMC may choose to require a PMC resolution\r\nto approve the nomination of a contributor by one of the active\r\ncommitters in that subproject.  All committers must have a signed\r\nContributor License Agreement on file with the Secretary of the\r\nCorporation.  Since, in most cases, contributors will already\r\nhave contributed significant amounts of code, this should usually\r\nhave been done before nomination.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n8.3 Although committers have write access to all Apache Xerces \r\nsubprojects,\r\nthey are only permitted to make changes to the subprojects to which they\r\nhave been elected committers.  A committer may be elected to multiple\r\nsubprojects, but, except that no new access need be granted, the \r\nprocess is the same as for any other contributor.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n8.4 For the purposes of voting, committers will be classed as \"active\" or\r\n\"inactive\". Only active committers will be included in the totals used to \r\ndetermine the success or failure of a particular vote, and\r\nonly active committers are part of the PMC.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n8.5 Committers remain active as long as they are contributing code or\r\nposting to the subproject mailing lists.  If a committer has neither\r\ncontributed code nor posted to the subproject mailing lists in 3\r\nmonths, the PMC chair may e-mail the \r\ncommitter, the subproject development list, and the PMC mailing list \r\nnotifying the committer that they are going to be moved to inactive \r\nstatus.  If there is no response in 72 hours, the committer will become \r\ninactive, and may be removed from the PMC mailing list.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\n8.6 An inactive status will not prevent a committer committing new code\r\nchanges or posting to the mailing lists.  Either of these activities will\r\nautomatically re-activate the committer for the purposes of \r\nvoting, and necessitate their addition to the PMC mailing list.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/s2>\r\n<s2 title=\"9 INFRASTRUCTURE\" >\r\n<p>\r\n9.1 The Apache Xerces project relies on the Apache XML project \r\nand the Apache Infrastructure project for the following:\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\na) Bug Database -- This is a system for tracking bugs and feature\r\n   requests.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nb) Subproject Source Repositories -- These are several repositories\r\n   containing both the source code and documentation for the\r\n   subprojects. \r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nc) Website -- A xerces.apache.org website will contain information about\r\n   the Apache Xerces project, including documentation, downloads of\r\n   releases, and this charter.

It is\r\n   intended for discussions that cross subprojects.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>\r\nf) Subproject Mailing Lists -- Each subproject should have at least one \r\ndevoted mailing\r\n   list.
