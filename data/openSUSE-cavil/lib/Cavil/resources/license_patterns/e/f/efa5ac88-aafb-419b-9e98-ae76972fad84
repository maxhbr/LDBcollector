Only one\n    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\n    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the\n    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity\n    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\n    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous\n    publisher that added the old one.\n\n    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by\n    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for\n    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n    You may combine the Document with other documents released\n    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for\n    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\n    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\n    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your\n    combined work in its license notice.\n\n    The combined work need only contain one copy of this\n    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced\n    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with\n    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such\n    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the\n    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,\n    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section\n    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of\n    the combined work.\n\n    In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled\n    \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\n    entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled\n    \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You\n    must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and\n    other documents released under this License, and replace the\n    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a\n    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you\n    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of\n    the documents in all other respects.\n\n    You may extract a single document from such a collection,\n    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you\n    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and\n    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim\n    copying of that document.\n\n    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n    \n    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a\n    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation\n    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is\n    called an \"aggregate\", and this License does not apply to the\n    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on\n    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves\n    derivative works of the Document.\n\n    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to\n    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than\n    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts\n    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the\n    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole\n    aggregate.\n\n    8. TRANSLATION\n\n    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section\n    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires\n    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may\n    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition\n    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may\n    include a translation of this License provided that you also\n    include the original English version of this License.  In case of\n    a disagreement between the translation and the original English\n    version of this License, the original English version will\n    prevail.\n\n    9. TERMINATION\n    \n    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\n    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any\n    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the\n    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\n    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full\n    compliance.\n\n    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised\n    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\n    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\n    concerns.  See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\n\n    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing\n    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular\n    numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to\n    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n    either of that specified version or of any later version that has\n    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,\n    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the\n    Free Software Foundation.\n\n    How to use this License for your documents\n\n    To use this License in a document you have written, include\n    a copy of the License in the document and put the following\n    copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n\n      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\n      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1\n      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n      Free Documentation License\".\n\n\n    If you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant\n    Sections\" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have\n    no Front-Cover Texts, write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of\n    \"Front-Cover Texts being LIST\"; likewise for Back-Cover\n    Texts.\n\n    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program\n    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your\n    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public\n    License, to permit their use in free software","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"efa5ac88-aafb-419b-9e98-ae76972fad84"}
