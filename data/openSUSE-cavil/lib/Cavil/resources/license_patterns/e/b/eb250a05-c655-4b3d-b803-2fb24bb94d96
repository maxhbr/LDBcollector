After consultation with\nremaining members of the original EUROPAGATE consortium, we are re-issuing\nthe CCL module without a separate license.

At this time, the project consortium has long-since\ndisbanded, and the majority of the original principals have retired. At the\nsame time, we have significantly modified the software during the following\nyears, to the point where very practically no original code remains. To\nsimplify re-use of the software, we have contacted those members of the\nconsortium who could be reached, and agreed to re-issue the module as a\nproper part of the YAZ package","risk":1,"spdx":"BSD-3-Clause","trademark":0,"unique_id":"eb250a05-c655-4b3d-b803-2fb24bb94d96"}
