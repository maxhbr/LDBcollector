This license may be particularly\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but \nit is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is \nunrelated to TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\nthat work may be distributed.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n   `Work'\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\n    \n   `Derived Work'\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\n\n   `Modification' \n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n    translated into another language.\n\n   `Modify'\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\n    applicable law.\n    \n   `Distribution'\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\n   `Compiled Work'\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n\n   `Current Maintainer'\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\n    any applicable law.\n\n   `Base Interpreter' \n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \n\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\n    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the \n    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\n1.  Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\ndirectly from the Work.\n\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\nbe updated versions of the Work.\n\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\nthe Derived Work.\n\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \nto a component of the Work. \n\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter.\n     \n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\n     of the changes.\n  \n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\n\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\n          unmodified copy of the Work.\n\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\nregard to the Derived Work.\n\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\napplying that process.\n     \n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n      \n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\n\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\nparticular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and\/or modify the Work as\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\nor simply that it is `author-maintained'.\n\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\nor act upon these error reports.\n\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\nsignificant signs of active maintenance","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"ec73c6ee-fc21-410e-9971-94d861e18ed9"}
