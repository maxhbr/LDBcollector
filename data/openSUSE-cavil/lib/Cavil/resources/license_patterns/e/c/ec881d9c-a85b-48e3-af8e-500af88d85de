The use of Firebird is governed by two licenses: the IPL (InterBase Public License) and the IDPL (Initial\nDeveloper's Public License). The first one covers the parts of the source code that were inherited from InterBase;\nthe second applies to the additions and improvements made by the Firebird Project. Both licenses offer similar\nrights and restrictions. In short:\n• Use of the software is free, even for commercial purposes. You may also redistribute the software, separately\nor with a product of your own, but you may not claim ownership or credit for it. Any license notices included\nwith Firebird must remain intact.\n• You may modify and recompile the Firebird source code or parts of it. You may distribute such modified\nversions, but if you do so, you must document your modifications and make them publicly available, at no\ncost, under the same license as the original code.\n• You may include Firebird source code (modified or not) in a larger work and distribute that larger work,\nin source and\/or compiled form, under a license of your own choosing. You need not publicize the source\ncode for the entire larger work, but you must fulfill the license conditions for the parts that were taken from\nFirebird, whether they were modified or not","risk":1,"spdx":"Interbase-1.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"ec881d9c-a85b-48e3-af8e-500af88d85de"}
