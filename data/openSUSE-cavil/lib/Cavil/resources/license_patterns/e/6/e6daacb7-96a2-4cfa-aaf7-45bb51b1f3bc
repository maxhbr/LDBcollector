{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of\nthe software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand\/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program\nor any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing\nthe Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\nof the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\nmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\n    or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\n    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\n    terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in\n    the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a\n    copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive\n    but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be\non the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to\nthe entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\nthe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\nbased on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\nthis License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\n    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program\n    in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\ncode distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed\n(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,\nunless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to\ncopy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\nthe object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\nit. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance\nof this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor\nto copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\nthe conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program\nat all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of\nthat system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\nthat choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,\nyou may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for\nthis. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\nOR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES\nOR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e6daacb7-96a2-4cfa-aaf7-45bb51b1f3bc"}
