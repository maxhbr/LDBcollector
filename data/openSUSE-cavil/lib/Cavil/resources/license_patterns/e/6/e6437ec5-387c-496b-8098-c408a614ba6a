You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are\nencouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file\n\"runtime\/doc\/uganda.txt\" for details (do \":help uganda\" inside Vim).\n\nSummary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an\nunmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license\ntext must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.\nThe license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and\ndistribute it.\n\n\nSPONSORING\n\nFixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show\nyour appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue\nworking on Vim please send a donation.\n\nSince Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children\nin Uganda.  See runtime\/doc\/uganda.txt.  But at the same time donations\nincrease Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!\n\nFor the most recent information about sponsoring look on the Vim web site:\n\n\thttp:\/\/www.vim.org\/sponsor","risk":2,"spdx":"Vim","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e6437ec5-387c-496b-8098-c408a614ba6a"}
