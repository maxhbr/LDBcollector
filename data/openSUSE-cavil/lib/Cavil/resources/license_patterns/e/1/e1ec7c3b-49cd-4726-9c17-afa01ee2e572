And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n47      \n\n48      \n\n We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n\n49      \n\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n\n50      \n\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n\n51      \n\n52      \n\n To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n\n53      \n\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n\n54      \n\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n\n55      \n\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n\n56      \n\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n\n57      \n\nintroduced by others.\n\n58      \n\n\n\n59      \n\n Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n\n60      \n\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n\n61      \n\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n\n62      \n\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.
