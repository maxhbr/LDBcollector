By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\r\n\r\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.\r\n\r\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-3.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e5bedeb3-2901-42d9-aca7-ef816fdba75a"}
