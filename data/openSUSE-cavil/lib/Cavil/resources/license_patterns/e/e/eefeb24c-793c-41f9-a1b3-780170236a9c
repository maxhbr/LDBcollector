Secondarily, this License\r\npreserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\r\nwork, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n   This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\r\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\r\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\r\ndesigned for free software.\r\n\r\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program\r\nshould come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\r\ndoes.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\r\nused for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is\r\npublished as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for\r\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice\r\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the\r\nterms of this License.  The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual\r\nor work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as\r\n\"you\".\r\n\r\n   A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\r\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\r\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\n   A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section\r\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\r\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\r\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\r\nwithin that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\r\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\r\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\r\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\r\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\n   The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\r\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that\r\nsays that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\n   The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\r\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\r\nthe Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\n   A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the general\r\npublic, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\r\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\r\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\r\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for\r\nautomatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\r\nformatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose\r\nmarkup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification\r\nby readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is\r\ncalled \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\r\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or\r\nXML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML\r\ndesigned for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,\r\nPDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary\r\nword processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools\r\nare not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by\r\nsome word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\n   The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\r\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\r\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats\r\nwhich do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\r\nnear the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the\r\nbeginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nVERBATIM COPYING\r\n================\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\r\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\r\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\r\nthe Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\r\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\r\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying\r\nof the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\r\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\r\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\r\nyou may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n===================\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\r\nand the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\r\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\r\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\r\nback cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as\r\nthe publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full\r\ntitle with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You\r\nmay add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes\r\nlimited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\r\nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim\r\ncopying in other respects.\r\n\r\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\r\npages.\r\n\r\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\r\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\r\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\r\npublicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\r\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\r\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\r\ncharge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\r\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\r\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\r\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\r\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\r\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of\r\nthe Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\r\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\r\nDocument.\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS\r\n=============\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\r\nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\r\nModified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version\r\nfilling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and\r\nmodification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.\r\nIn addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\n  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\r\n     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\r\n     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\r\n     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\r\n     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n\r\n  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\r\n     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\r\n     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of\r\n     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than\r\n     five).\r\n\r\n  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified\r\n     Version, as the publisher.\r\n\r\n  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n\r\n  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent\r\n     to the other copyright notices.\r\n\r\n  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\n     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\r\n     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n\r\n  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant\r\n     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license\r\n     notice.\r\n\r\n  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n\r\n  I. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to\r\n     it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\r\n     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\r\n     there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\r\n     stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\r\n     given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\r\n     Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n\r\n  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\r\n     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\r\n     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\r\n     it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\r\n     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\r\n     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\r\n     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n\r\n  K. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\r\n     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\r\n     substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\r\n     and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n\r\n  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in\r\n     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent\r\n     are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n\r\n  M. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section may not\r\n     be included in the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n  N. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to\r\n     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\n\r\n   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\r\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\r\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\r\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\r\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\r\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\n   You may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\r\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties-for\r\nexample, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by\r\nan organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and\r\na passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\r\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover\r\nText and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements\r\nmade by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text\r\nfor the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by\r\nthe same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;\r\nbut you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the\r\nprevious publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\r\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\r\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\nCOMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n===================\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\r\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\r\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\r\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\r\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding\r\nat the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\r\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the\r\nsame adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections\r\nin the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\"\r\nin the various original documents, forming one section entitled\r\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\r\nand any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\r\nentitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n========================\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\r\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\r\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\r\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\r\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\r\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\r\nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of\r\nthe Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\r\ncompilation.  Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this\r\nLicense does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\r\nwith the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are\r\nnot themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\r\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of\r\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers\r\nthat surround only the Document within the aggregate.  Otherwise they\r\nmust appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\r\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing\r\nInvariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\r\ntheir copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\r\nInvariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these\r\nInvariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License\r\nprovided that you also include the original English version of this\r\nLicense.  In case of a disagreement between the translation and the\r\noriginal English version of this License, the original English version\r\nwill prevail.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION\r\n===========\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\r\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\r\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\r\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\r\nwill not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\r\nin full compliance.\r\n\r\nFUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n================================\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\r\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\r\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\r\nhttps:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\r\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\r\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\r\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\r\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\r\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\r\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and license\r\nnotices just after the title page:\r\n\r\n     Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\r\n     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\r\n     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1\r\n     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\n     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\r\n     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\r\n     Free Documentation License\".\r\n\r\n   If you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant Sections\"\r\ninstead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover\r\nTexts, write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of \"Front-Cover Texts being\r\nLIST\"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.\r\n\r\n   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\r\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free\r\nsoftware license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit\r\ntheir use in free software","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"eefeb24c-793c-41f9-a1b3-780170236a9c"}
