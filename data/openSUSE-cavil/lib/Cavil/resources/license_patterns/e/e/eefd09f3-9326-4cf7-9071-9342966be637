This version removes the\ncopyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the\nW3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the\nlicense, and removes the ambiguous grant of \"use\". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous\nversion and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and\nOSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.
