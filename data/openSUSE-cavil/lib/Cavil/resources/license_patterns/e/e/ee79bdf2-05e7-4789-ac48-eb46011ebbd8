Make the same adjustment to the section titles in\n     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n     combined work.\n\n     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n     \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\n     Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n     \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".
