Here is why we make this rather odd-sounding\nrequest:\n\nGuile is normally licensed under a weakened form of the GNU General\nPublic License, which allows you to link code with Guile without\nplacing that code under the GPL.  This exception is important to some\npeople.\n\nHowever, since readline is distributed under the GNU General Public\nLicense, when you link Guile with readline, either statically or\ndynamically, you effectively change Guile's license to the strict GPL.\nWhenever you link any strictly GPL'd code into Guile, uses of Guile\nwhich are normally permitted become forbidden.  This is a rather\nnon-obvious consequence of the licensing terms.\n\nSo, to make sure things remain clear, please let people choose for\nthemselves whether to link GPL'd libraries like readline with Guile","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"195fa1f1-fa1b-4fff-879e-898b17b7b21c"}
