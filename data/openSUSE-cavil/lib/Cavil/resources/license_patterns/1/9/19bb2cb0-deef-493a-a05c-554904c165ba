ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\n\tTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n\t1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\t\"Contribution\" means:\n\t\t1. in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\t\tdocumentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n\t\t2. in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n      \t\t\t1. changes to the Program, and\n      \t\t\t2. additions to the Program;\n\n\t\twhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate\n\t\tfrom and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A\n\t\tContribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to\n\t\tthe Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n\t\tContributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\n\t\tthe Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\n\t\tdistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n\t\tlicense agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the\n\t\tProgram.\n\n\t\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\t\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\n\twhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\n\talone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\t\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\tAgreement.\n\n\t\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\tincluding all Contributors.\n\n\n\t2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n\t\t1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n\t\thereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n\t\troyalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative\n\t\tworks of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and\n\t\tsublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\n\t\tsuch derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n\t\t2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n\t\thereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n\t\troyalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,\n\t\tuse, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n\t\tContribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n\t\tobject code form. This patent license shall apply to the\n\t\tcombination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\n\t\tthe Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of\n\t\tthe Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n\t\tLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\t\tother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware\n\t\tper se is licensed hereunder.\n\n\t\t3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants\n\t\tthe licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no\n\t\tassurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program\n\t\tdoes not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\n\t\trights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\n\t\tliability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity\n\t\tbased on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n\t\totherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\t\tgranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n\t\tresponsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n\t\tneeded, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n\t\trequired to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n\t\tRecipient's responsibility to acquire that license before\n\t\tdistributing the Program.\n\n\t\t4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n\t\tsufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to\n\t\tgrant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n\n\t3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n\tA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\tunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n\t\t1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n\t\tand\n\n\t\t2. its license agreement:\n\t\t\t1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors\n\t\t\tall warranties and conditions, express and implied,\n\t\t\tincluding warranties or conditions of title and\n\t\t\tnon-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions\n\t\t\tof merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n\t\t\t2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors\n\t\t\tall liability for damages, including direct, indirect,\n\t\t\tspecial, incidental and consequential damages, such as\n\t\t\tlost profits;\n\n\t\t\t3. states that any provisions which differ from this\n\t\t\tAgreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not\n\t\t\tby any other party; and\n\n\t\t\t4. states that source code for the Program is available\n\t\t\tfrom such Contributor, and informs licensees how to\n\t\t\tobtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium\n\t\t\tcustomarily used for software exchange.\n\n\t\tWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\t\t\t1. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n         \t\t2. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each\n\t\t\tcopy of the Program.\n\n\t\tContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices\n\t\tcontained within the Program.\n\n\t\tEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\t\tContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows\n\t\tsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the\n\t\tContribution.\n\n\n\t4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n\tCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\twith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\tlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n\tthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n\toffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n\tliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n\tthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n\t(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n\tother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n\tdamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n\tand other legal actions brought by a third party against the\n\tIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions\n\tof such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of\n\tthe Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\n\tsection do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or\n\talleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an\n\tIndemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n\tContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\n\tContributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\n\tin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\n\tIndemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own\n\texpense.\n\n\tFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\tproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\tContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n\tclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n\tclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n\talone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n\tdefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\n\tperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\n\tContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\n\tmust pay those damages.\n\n\n\t5. NO WARRANTY\n\n\tEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\n\tPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n\tKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\n\tWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR\n\tFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible\n\tfor determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the\n\tProgram and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights\n\tunder this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs\n\tof program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss\n\tof data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n\toperations.\n\n\n\t6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n\tEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\tANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\tINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\tWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\tLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\tNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\n\tDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\n\tHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\t7. GENERAL\n\n\tIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\tapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\tthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n\taction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n\tminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n\tIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\n\trespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\n\tcounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\n\tContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\n\tof the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\n\tinstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\tcross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\titself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\n\thardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n\trights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n\tlitigation is filed.\n\n\tAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\tto comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n\tAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time\n\tafter becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights\n\tunder this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and\n\tdistribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,\n\tRecipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted\n\tby Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive","risk":4,"spdx":"CPL-1.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"19bb2cb0-deef-493a-a05c-554904c165ba"}
