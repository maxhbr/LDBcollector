Likewise for a collection of short\ndocuments---you only need one copy of the GNU FDL for the whole\ncollection.  For a single short document, you can use a very permissive\nnon-copyleft license, to avoid taking up space with a long license.\n\nSee @uref{http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl-howto.html} for more explanation\nof how to employ the GFDL.\n\nNote that it is not obligatory to include a copy of the GNU GPL or GNU\nLGPL in a manual whose license is neither the GPL nor the LGPL.  It can\nbe a good idea to include the program's license in a large manual; in a\nshort manual, whose size would be increased considerably by including\nthe program's license, it is probably better not to include it.\n\n@node Manual Credits\n@section Manual Credits\n@cindex credits for manuals\n\nPlease credit the principal human writers of the manual as the authors,\non the title page of the manual.  If a company sponsored the work, thank\nthe company in a suitable place in the manual, but do not cite the\ncompany as an author.\n\n@node Printed Manuals\n@section Printed Manuals\n\nThe FSF publishes some GNU manuals in printed form.  To encourage sales\nof these manuals, the on-line versions of the manual should mention at\nthe very start that the printed manual is available and should point at\ninformation for getting it---for instance, with a link to the page\n@url{http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/order\/order.html}.  This should not be included\nin the printed manual, though, because there it is redundant","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"1fbbdaaa-73b1-4922-9a90-2dfc1f33f141"}
