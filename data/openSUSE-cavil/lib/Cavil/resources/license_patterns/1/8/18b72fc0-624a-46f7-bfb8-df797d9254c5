PREAMBLE<\/STRONG> \n<P>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other \nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure \neveryone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without \nmodifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License \npreserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while \nnot being considered responsible for modifications made by others. \n<P>This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of \nthe document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU \nGeneral Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. \n<P>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free \nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should \ncome with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this \nLicense is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, \nregardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We \nrecommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or \nreference. \n<P><STRONG>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/STRONG> \n<P>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that \ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed \nunder the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free \nlicense, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated \nherein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of \nthe public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if \nyou copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under \ncopyright law. \n<P>A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document \nor a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or \ntranslated into another language. \n<P>A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the \nDocument that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or \nauthors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related \nmatters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall \nsubject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a \nSecondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a \nmatter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of \nlegal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. \n<P>The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are \ndesignated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that \nthe Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above\ndefinition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. \nThe Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not \nidentify any Invariant Sections then there are none. \n<P>The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as \nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document \nis released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a \nBack-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. \n<P>A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, \nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, \nthat is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text \neditors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for \ndrawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input \nto text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable \nfor input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file \nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or \ndiscourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image \nformat is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy \nthat is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". \n<P>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII \nwithout markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a \npublicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF \ndesigned for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include \nPNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read \nand edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD \nand\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated \nHTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes \nonly. \n<P>The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such \nfollowing pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License \nrequires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any \ntitle page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent \nappearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. \n\n<P>A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title \neither is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that \ntranslates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name \nmentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \n\"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the \nDocument means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this \ndefinition. \n<P>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states \nthat this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are \nconsidered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards \ndisclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers \nmay have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. \n<P><STRONG>2. VERBATIM COPYING<\/STRONG> \n<P>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially \nor noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the \nlicense notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all \ncopies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this \nLicense. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading \nor further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept \ncompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of \ncopies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. \n<P>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may \npublicly display copies. \n<P><STRONG>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<\/STRONG> \n<P>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed \ncovers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license \nnotice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, \nclearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front \ncover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and \nlegibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must \npresent the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and \nvisible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with \nchanges limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the \nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in \nother respects. \n<P>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you \nshould put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual \ncover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. \n<P>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more \nthan 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with \neach Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network \nlocation from which the general network-using public has access to download \nusing public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the \nDocument, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take \nreasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in \nquantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at \nthe stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute \nan Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to \nthe public. \n<P>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the \nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a \nchance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. \n<P><STRONG>4. MODIFICATIONS<\/STRONG> \n<P>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the \nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified \nVersion under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role \nof the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified \nVersion to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things \nin the Modified Version: \n<P>\n<UL>\n  <LI><STRONG>A.<\/STRONG> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a \n  title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions \n  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the \n  Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original \n  publisher of that version gives permission. \n  <LI><STRONG>B.<\/STRONG> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more \n  persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the \n  Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the \n  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless \n  they release you from this requirement. \n  <LI><STRONG>C.<\/STRONG> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of \n  the Modified Version, as the publisher. \n  <LI><STRONG>D.<\/STRONG> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. \n  <LI><STRONG>E.<\/STRONG> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your \n  modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. \n  <LI><STRONG>F.<\/STRONG> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a \n  license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under \n  the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. \n  <LI><STRONG>G.<\/STRONG> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of \n  Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license \n  notice. \n  <LI><STRONG>H.<\/STRONG> Include an unaltered copy of this License. \n  <LI><STRONG>I.<\/STRONG> Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its \n  Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, \n  and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is \n  no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, \n  year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then \n  add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous \n  sentence. \n  <LI><STRONG>J.<\/STRONG> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the \n  Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise \n  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based \n  on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network \n  location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document \n  itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives \n  permission. \n  <LI><STRONG>K.<\/STRONG> For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \n  \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section \n  all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or \n  dedications given therein. \n  <LI><STRONG>L.<\/STRONG> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, \n  unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent \n  are not considered part of the section titles. \n  <LI><STRONG>M.<\/STRONG> Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a \n  section may not be included in the Modified Version. \n  <LI><STRONG>N.<\/STRONG> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \n  \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. \n  <LI><STRONG>O.<\/STRONG> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. <\/LI><\/UL>\n<P>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that \nqualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, \nyou may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To \ndo this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified \nVersion's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section \ntitles. \n<P>You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing \nbut endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, \nstatements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization \nas the authoritative definition of a standard. \n<P>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a \npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover \nTexts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of \nBack-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one \nentity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, \npreviously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting \non behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on \nexplicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. \n<P>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give \npermission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply \nendorsement of any Modified Version. \n<P><STRONG>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<\/STRONG> \n<P>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this \nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, \nprovided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of \nall of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant \nSections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all \ntheir Warranty Disclaimers. \n<P>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple \nidentical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are \nmultiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the \ntitle of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, \nthe name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a \nunique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of \nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. \n<P>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the \nvarious original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise \ncombine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \n\"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\" \n<P><STRONG>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<\/STRONG> \n<P>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents \nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License \nin the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, \nprovided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each \nof the documents in all other respects. \n<P>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it \nindividually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into \nthe extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding \nverbatim copying of that document. \n<P><STRONG>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<\/STRONG> \n<P>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and \nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution \nmedium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation \nis not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the \nindividual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this \nLicense does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not \nthemselves derivative works of the Document. \n<P>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of \nthe Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire \naggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the \nDocument within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the \nDocument is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers \nthat bracket the whole aggregate. \n<P><STRONG>8. TRANSLATION<\/STRONG> \n<P>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute \ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant \nSections with translations requires special permission from their copyright \nholders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in \naddition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a \ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and \nany Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English \nversion of this License and the original versions of those notices and \ndisclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original \nversion of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will \nprevail. \n<P>If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \nor \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will \ntypically require changing the actual title. \n<P><STRONG>9. TERMINATION<\/STRONG> \n<P>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as \nexpressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, \nsublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate \nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or \nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so \nlong as such parties remain in full compliance. \n<P><STRONG>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<\/STRONG> \n<P>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU \nFree Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar \nin spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new \nproblems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/. \n<P>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the \nDocument specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any \nlater version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and \nconditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has \nbeen published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document \ndoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version \never published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. \n<P>\n<H2><A href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl.html#TOC4\" name=SEC4>How to use \nthis License for your documents<\/A><\/H2>\n<P>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the \nLicense in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just \nafter the title page: \n<P><PRE>      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\n      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\n\t Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n      Free Documentation License\".\n<\/PRE>\n<P>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, \nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this: \n<P><PRE>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n<\/PRE>\n<P>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination \nof the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. \n<P>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend \nreleasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, \nsuch as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software. \n<P>\n<HR>\nFor more information see <A href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/home.html\">GNU's home page<\/A>. \n<P>FSF &amp; GNU inquiries &amp; questions to <A\nhref=\"mailto:gnu@gnu.org\"><EM>gnu@gnu.org<\/EM><\/A>.
