We want to allow in part what\r\n|   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special\r\n|   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a\r\n|   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the \r\n|   future as another exception but one is not currently available.\r\n|\r\n|   http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/licenses\/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface\r\n|\r\n|   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you\r\n|   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with\r\n|   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,\r\n|   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy\r\n|   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,\r\n|   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete\r\n|   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the\r\n|   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General\r\n|   Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a\r\n|   module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.\r\n|\r\n|   Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated\r\n|   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is\r\n|   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License\r\n|   gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this\r\n|   exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which\r\n|   carries forward this exception.\r\n|\r\n|   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n|   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\r\n|   Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\r\n|   All trademarks belong to their respective owners","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"1b163268-c085-4424-9904-b4e99d3dc7ff"}
