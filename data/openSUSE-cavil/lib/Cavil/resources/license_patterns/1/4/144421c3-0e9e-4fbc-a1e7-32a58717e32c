Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,\r\n   you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.\r\n   In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software\r\n   that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not\r\n  - work around any technical limitations in the software;\r\n  - reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise\r\n    attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the\r\n    extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain\r\n    open source components that may be included in the software;\r\n  - remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers\r\n    in the software; \r\n  - use the software in any way that is against the law; or\r\n  - share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a\r\n    stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this\r\n    agreement to any third party.\r\n\r\n6.

This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,\r\n   Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire\r\n   agreement for the software and support services.\r\n\r\n9. APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States,\r\n   Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this\r\n   agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other\r\n   claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.\r\n\r\n10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal\r\n    rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under\r\n    the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship\r\n    with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from\r\n    which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other\r\n    rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.\r\n    For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or\r\n    mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\r\n  a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law\r\n     and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\r\n  b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving\r\n     updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your\r\n     device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,\r\n     however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),\r\n     or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also\r\n     specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\r\n  c) Germany and Austria.\r\n     (i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any\r\n         Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no\r\n         contractual guarantee in relation to the software.\r\n     (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross\r\n          negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in\r\n          case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable\r\n          according to the statutory law.\r\n\r\n  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight\r\n  negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,\r\n  the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the\r\n  breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the\r\n  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \r\n  \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will\r\n  not be liable for slight negligence\r\n\r\n11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \"AS-IS.\" YOU BEAR THE RISK\r\n    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.\r\n    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE\r\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n    NON-INFRINGEMENT. \r\n\r\n12.

YOU CANNOT\r\n    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,\r\n    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nThis limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,\r\ncontent (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party\r\napplications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,\r\nguarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the\r\nextent permitted by applicable law.\r\n\r\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility\r\nof the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because\r\nyour state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,\r\nconsequential or other damages.\r\nPlease note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the\r\nclauses in this agreement are provided below in French.\r\n \r\nRemarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses\r\ndans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.\r\n \r\nEXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert «tel quel».\r\nToute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.

Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou\r\nla limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou \r\nde quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion \r\nci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.\r\n \r\nEFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous\r\npourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent\r\ncontrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si\r\ncelles-ci ne le permettent pas.\r\n","risk":5,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"144421c3-0e9e-4fbc-a1e7-32a58717e32c"}
