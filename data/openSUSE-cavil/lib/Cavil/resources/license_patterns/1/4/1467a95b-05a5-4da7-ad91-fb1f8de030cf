Please read it before installing the Fonts. If you don’t\r\naccept this agreement, don’t install the Fonts. This End User License Agreement\r\n(hereinafter “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you, or, if you represent a legal\r\nentity, that legal entity (hereinafter “You”) and Typodermic Fonts Inc. (hereinafter\r\n“Typodermic”). By installing the fonts, you accept this agreement. “Fonts” means the fonts\r\n(i.e. font software) specified in your invoice or included with this agreement. THIS\r\nAGREEMENT COVERS FREE FONTS AS WELL AS FONTS FOR SALE.\r\n1. Installation\r\n1.1: Your invoice indicates the number of workstations on which you may install the Fonts.\r\nThe basic license is for 1-5 workstations. If you need to use the Fonts on more workstations\r\nthan your invoice states, you must purchase an upgrade. Any number of printers or output\r\ndevices may be used. The licensed workstations need not be at the same business location.\r\n1.2: Apart from the workstations licensed, you may also install the Fonts on a network\r\nserver. The number of workstations licensed means each and every workstation where the\r\nFonts will be used, not just the maximum number on a network that might possibly use it at\r\nany one time.\r\n1.3: For every workstation for which you are licensed, you may also install the Fonts on a\r\nportable (laptop) computer, phone, tablet and\/or a home computer, provided the Fonts are\r\nnot used on the secondary computer(s) at the same time. At home, you may not install the\r\nFonts on the computers of other family members.\r\n1.4: If the Fonts are free, you may distribute the Fonts within the same company or\r\nhousehold, provided this license agreement is included.\r\n2. Copyright\r\n2.1: You have not bought the Fonts: you are licensed to use them, by the terms and\r\nconditions of this agreement. Typodermic Fonts Inc. retains title and all copyrights to the\r\nFonts, and all copies and adaptations thereof in whatever media. The Fonts are intellectual\r\nproperty, containing proprietary information and valuable trade secrets, and as such they are\r\nprotected by the copyright laws of many nations, and by international treaties. You may not\r\ncopy the Fonts, except as specified in this agreement.\r\n2.2: Archival copies of the Fonts may be made.\r\n2.3: You may provide a copy of the Fonts to your service bureau or commercial printer, with\r\nthe job files for output, but only if you are assured that the Fonts will be used only for\r\noutputting your files and will be deleted subsequently.\r\n2.4: Embedding of the Fonts in documents (e.g. PDF files) is permitted for viewing and\r\nprinting, but not for editing. If someone at a remote location wants to edit a document\r\nwhich contains embedded Fonts, they must purchase their own license. Internal corporate\r\ndocuments with embedded Fonts may of course be edited on licensed workstations.\r\n2.5: You may not rent, lease, sub-license, distribute, disseminate, give away or lend the\r\nFonts. You may permanently transfer the Fonts provided the recipient accepts the terms of\r\nthis agreement, and if you delete all your copies of the Fonts.\r\n2.6: You may modify typesetting produced by the Fonts in any way you see fit. You may\r\nalso modify the Fonts for your own personal or internal business use, but you may not\r\ndistribute, or transfer your adaptations; for instance, (a) you may not make customized\r\nversions of the Fonts for use by your clients, (b) you may not adapt, or merge the Fonts to\r\ncreate hybrid Fonts for resale. Each workstation where a modified Font is installed shall be\r\ncounted as one of your permitted number of users.\r\nTypodermic Fonts Inc. End User License Agreement (02-2014) Page 1 of 22.7: Use by Employees and Freelancers. It is your \r\nresponsibility to inform employees,\r\nfreelancers and any others who have access to the Fonts at your premises, of the terms and\r\nconditions of this agreement, and to ensure that they abide by these terms and conditions.\r\n3.

Typodermic shall have no responsibility to replace the Fonts or refund\r\nthe purchase price if failure results from accident, abuse or misapplication, or if any Fonts\r\nare lost or damaged due to theft, fire, or negligence. Any replacement product will be\r\nwarranted for twenty one (21) days. This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may\r\nhave other rights, which vary from state to state.
