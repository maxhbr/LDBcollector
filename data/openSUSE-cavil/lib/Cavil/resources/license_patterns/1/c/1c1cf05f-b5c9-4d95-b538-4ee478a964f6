The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and\r\ninternational copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property\r\nlaws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold. \r\n\r\n3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into\r\nModules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of\r\nwhich they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified in\r\nthe license certificate (\"License Certificate\") accompanying the\r\nLicensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered\r\npart of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict between\r\nthe language of this Agreement and the License Certificate, the\r\nprovisions of this Agreement shall govern. \r\n\r\n4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,\r\nLicensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee\r\ndoes not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may not install,\r\ncopy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. Licensee may, however,\r\nreturn it to Licensee's place of purchase within 14 days of purchase for\r\na full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using\r\nany updates or other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee\r\nreceives separately as part of the Licensed Software (\"Updates\"),\r\nLicensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that\r\naccompany such Updates, if any. If Licensee does not agree to the\r\nadditional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not\r\ninstall, copy, or otherwise use such Updates. \r\n\r\n5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this\r\nAgreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed\r\nSoftware in the manner provided below. \r\n\r\n6. Trolltech grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,\r\nperpetual license to make, use and modify copies of the Licensed\r\nSoftware for the maximum number of named individuals within Licensee's\r\norganization (\"Named User\"(s)) specified in the License Certificate for\r\nthe sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's\r\nsoftware product(s), which may include the Licensed Software\r\n(\"Applications\"). Modified Licensed Software shall be considered as\r\nLicensed Software for the purposes of this Agreement. \r\n\r\n7. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited\r\nnumber of computers provided that only the Named Users use the Licensed\r\nSoftware. Licensee may at any time designate another Named User within\r\nLicensee's organization to replace a then-current Named User by\r\nnotifying Trolltech, provided that a) the then-current Named User has\r\nnot been designated as a replacement during the last six (6) months; and\r\nb) there is no more than the specified number of Named Users at any\r\ngiven time. \r\n\r\n8. Verification: Trolltech or a certified auditor on Trolltech's behalf,\r\nmay, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit Licensee with\r\nrespect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such audit may be conducted\r\nby mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee's\r\nplace of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during\r\nregular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not\r\nunreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. Trolltech\r\nwill not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during\r\nthe course of an audit. Licensee does not implicitly grant Trolltech any\r\nform of license agreement. If an audit reveals that Licensee is using\r\nthe Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation of the\r\nterms of the Agreement, then Licensee shall pay Trolltech's reasonable\r\ncosts of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation,\r\nLicensee agrees to pay Trolltech any amounts owing that are attributable\r\nto the unauthorized use. In the alternative, Trolltech reserves the\r\nright, at Trolltech's sole option, to terminate the licenses for the\r\nLicensed Software. \r\n\r\n9. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or\r\ncode (collectively \"Third Party Libraries\") to implement various\r\nfunctions. Third Party Libraries do not comprise part of the Licensed\r\nSoftware. In some cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included\r\nalong with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for\r\ndevelopment and testing only. Such source code and libraries as are or\r\nmay be listed in the \"...\/src\/3rdparty\" source tree delivered with the\r\nLicensed Software, as may be amended from time to time, do not comprise\r\nthe Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third Party\r\nLibraries may require additional licensing of copyright and patents from\r\nthe owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the Licensed\r\nSoftware referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may require\r\nappropriate licensing from such third parties. \r\n\r\nGENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES\r\n10. a) Trolltech grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to\r\nreproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of the\r\nLicensed Software (\"Redistributables\"), as specified in Appendix 1,\r\nSection 1, for execution on any operating system of a type listed in the\r\nLicense Certificate (\"Platforms\").

Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall\r\nreturn to Trolltech all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied\r\nby Trolltech.
