(collectively,\n  the \"Authors\") each hereby grants to you a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, nontransferable,\n  nonexclusive license to (i) copy, display, distribute and implement the Advanced Messaging Queue\n  Protocol (\"AMQP\") Specification and (ii) the Licensed Claims that are held by the Authors, all for\n  the purpose of implementing the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. Your license and\n  any rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from any Author if you\n  bring any claim, suit, demand, or action related to the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol\n  Specification against any Author. Upon termination, you shall destroy all copies of the Advanced\n  Messaging Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.\n\n  As used hereunder, \"Licensed Claims\" means those claims of a patent or patent application,\n  throughout the world, excluding design patents and design registrations, owned or controlled, or\n  that can be sublicensed without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, by\n  an Author or its affiliates now or at any future time and which would necessarily be infringed by\n  implementation of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is necessarily\n  infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no\n  plausible non-infringing alternative for implementing the required portions of the Advanced\n  Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims shall not\n  include any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Licensed\n  Claims; or that read solely on any implementations of any portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue\n  Protocol Specification that are not required by the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol\n  Specification, or that, if licensed, would require a payment of royalties by the licensor to\n  unaffiliated third parties. Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not include (i) any enabling\n  technologies that may be necessary to make or use any Licensed Product but are not themselves\n  expressly set forth in the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification (e.g., semiconductor\n  manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, networking technology,\n  operating system technology, and the like); or (ii) the implementation of other published\n  standards developed elsewhere and merely referred to in the body of the Advanced Messaging Queue\n  Protocol Specification, or (iii) any Licensed Product and any combinations thereof the purpose or\n  function of which is not required for compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol\n  Specification. For purposes of this definition, the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol\n  Specification shall be deemed to include both architectural and interconnection requirements\n  essential for interoperability and may also include supporting source code artifacts where such\n  architectural, interconnection requirements and source code artifacts are expressly identified as\n  being required or documentation to achieve compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol\n  Specification.\n\n  As used hereunder, \"Licensed Products\" means only those specific portions of products (hardware,\n  software or combinations thereof) that implement and are compliant with all relevant portions of\n  the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.\n\n  The following disclaimers, which you hereby also acknowledge as to any use you may make of the\n  Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification:\n\n  THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND THE AUTHORS MAKE NO\n  REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE CONTENTS\n  OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE\n  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD\n  PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.\n\n  THE AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY USE, IMPLEMENTATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE ADVANCED\n  MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION.\n\n  The name and trademarks of the Authors may NOT be used in any manner, including advertising or\n  publicity pertaining to the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification or its contents\n  without specific, written prior permission.
