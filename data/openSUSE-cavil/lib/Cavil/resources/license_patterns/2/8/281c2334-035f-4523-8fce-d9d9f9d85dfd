{"export_restricted":0,"license":"any reference local","packname":"libvirt","patent":0,"pattern":"strong>NOTE: as of libvirt 1.0.6, the VirtualBox driver will always\n        run inside the libvirtd daemon, instead of being built-in to the\n        libvirt.so library directly. This change was required due to the\n        fact that VirtualBox code is LGPLv2-only licensed, which is not\n        compatible with the libvirt.so license of LGPLv2-or-later. The\n        daemon will be auto-started when the first connection to VirtualBox\n        is requested. This change also means that it will not be possible\n        to use VirtualBox URIs on the Windows platform, until additional\n        work is completed to get the libvirtd daemon working there.<\/strong","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"281c2334-035f-4523-8fce-d9d9f9d85dfd"}
