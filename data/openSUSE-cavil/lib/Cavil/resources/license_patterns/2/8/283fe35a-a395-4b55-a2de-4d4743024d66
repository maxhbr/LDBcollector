By contrast, the GNU General Public License is \n      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change \n      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. \n      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software \n      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit \n      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered \n      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it \n      to your programs, too.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. \n      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the \n      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \n      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you \n      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free \n      programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone \n      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These \n      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \n      copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \n      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You \n      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you \n      must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      We protect your rights with two steps:\n      <orderedlist>\n\t<listitem>\n\t  <para>\t    copyright the software, and\n\t  <\/para>\n\t<\/listitem>\n\t<listitem>\n\t  <para>\t    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, \n\t    distribute and\/or modify the software.\n\t  <\/para>\n\t<\/listitem>\n      <\/orderedlist>\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that \n      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If \n      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its \n      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any \n      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' \n      reputations.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. \n      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will \n      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program \n      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be \n      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n    <\/para>\n    <para>      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification \n      follow.\n    <\/para>\n  <\/sect1>\n  <sect1>\n    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/title>\n    <sect2>\n      <title>Section 0<\/title>\n      <para>\tThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice \n\tplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms \n\tof this General Public License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously \n\tyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence \n\tyou may not distribute the Program at all.

Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \n\tdistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up \n\tto the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other \n\tsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n      <\/para>\n      <para>\tThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the \n\trest of this License.\n      <\/para>\n    <\/sect2>\n    <sect2>\n      <title>Section 8\n      <\/title>\n      <para>\tIf the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents \n\tor by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License \n\tmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that \n\tdistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
