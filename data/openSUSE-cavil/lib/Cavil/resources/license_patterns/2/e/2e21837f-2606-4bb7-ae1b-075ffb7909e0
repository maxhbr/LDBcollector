If\r\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\r\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\r\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\r\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\r\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\r\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\r\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\r\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\r\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\r\n     respect those requests where reasonable.
