The\r\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,\r\nredistributed and\/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\r\nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\r\nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\r\nrequirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\r\nto any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\r\nHolder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.
