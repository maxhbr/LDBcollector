The term \"Source Code\" means the\npreferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and\nall available documentation describing how to modify the Original\nWork. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the\nSource Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original\nWork that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy\nthis obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code\nin an information repository reasonably calculated to permit\ninexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor\ncontinues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the\naddress of that information repository in a notice immediately\nfollowing the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor\nthe names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their\ntrademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote\nproducts derived from this Original Work without express prior written\npermission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to\ngrant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or\nany other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated\nherein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to\nsell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of\nLicensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing\nin this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from\nlicensing under different terms from this License any Original Work\nthat Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\n\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any\nDerivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark\nnotices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any\nnotices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an\n\"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any\nDerivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution\nNotice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\nmodified the Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor\nwarrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent\nrights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are\nsublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission\nof the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as\nexpressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original\nWork is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT\nWARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting\nfrom Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\nlimitation.

If You distribute copies of the\nOriginal Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort\nunder the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to\nthe terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another\nwritten agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to\ncreate Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise\nany of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do\nso except under the terms of this License (or another written\nagreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by\nU.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by\ninternational treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights\ngranted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of\nthis License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate\nautomatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted\nto You by this License as of the date You commence an action,\nincluding a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any\nlicensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent.

Any action or suit relating\nto this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction\nwherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary\nbusiness, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its\nconflict-of-law provisions.

The following is intended to describe the essential \ndifferences between the Academic Free License (AFL) version 1.0 and other \nopen source licenses:\n\nThe Academic Free License is similar to the BSD, MIT, UoI\/NCSA and Apache \nlicenses in many respects but it is intended to solve a few problems with \nthose licenses.\n    \n* The AFL is written so as to make it clear what software is being \nlicensed (by the inclusion of a statement following the copyright notice \nin the software). This way, the license functions better than a template \nlicense. The BSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA licenses apply to unidentified software.\n    \n* The AFL contains a complete copyright grant to the software. The BSD \nand Apache licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect.\n    \n* The AFL contains a complete patent grant to the software. The BSD, MIT, \nUoI\/NCSA and Apache licenses rely on an implied patent license and contain \nno explicit patent grant.\n    \n* The AFL makes it clear that no trademark rights are granted to the \nlicensor's trademarks. The Apache license contains such a provision, but the \nBSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA licenses do not.\n    \n* The AFL includes the warranty by the licensor that it either owns the \ncopyright or that it is distributing the software under a license. None of \nthe other licenses contain that warranty. All other warranties are disclaimed, \nas is the case for the other licenses.\n\n* The AFL is itself copyrighted (with the right granted to copy and distribute \nwithout modification). This ensures that the owner of the copyright to the \nlicense will control changes. The Apache license contains a copyright notice, \nbut the BSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA licenses do not","risk":3,"spdx":"AFL-2.1","trademark":0,"unique_id":"234827a7-fab3-4415-b884-7caa0091ee30"}
