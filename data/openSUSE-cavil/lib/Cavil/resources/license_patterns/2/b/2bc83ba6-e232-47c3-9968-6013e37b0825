Public domain vs. attribution-required licenses\r\n\r\n  The primary difference between public domain and, say, a Creative Commons\r\n  commercial \/ non-share-alike \/ attribution license is solely the\r\n  requirement for attribution. (Similarly the BSD license and such.)\r\n  While I would *appreciate* acknowledgement and attribution, I believe\r\n  that it is foolish to place a legal encumberment (i.e. a license) on\r\n  the software *solely* to get attribution.\r\n\r\n  In other words, I'm arguing that PD is superior to the BSD license and\r\n  the Creative Commons 'Attribution' license. If the license offers\r\n  anything besides attribution -- as does, e.g., CC NonCommercial-ShareAlike,\r\n  or the GPL -- that's a separate discussion.\r\n\r\n3. Other aspects of BSD-style licenses besides attribution\r\n\r\n  Permissive licenses like zlib and BSD license are perfectly reasonable\r\n  in their requirements, but they are very wordy and\r\n  have only two benefits over public domain: legally-mandated\r\n  attribution and liability-control. I do not believe these\r\n  are worth the excessive verbosity and user-unfriendliness\r\n  these licenses induce, especially in the single-file\r\n  case where those licenses tend to be at the top of\r\n  the file, the first thing you see.\r\n\r\n  To the specific points, I have had no trouble receiving\r\n  attribution for my libraries; liability in the face of\r\n  no explicit disclaimer of liability is an open question,\r\n  but one I have a lot of difficulty imagining there being\r\n  any actual doubt about in court. Sometimes I explicitly\r\n  note in my libraries that I make no guarantees about them\r\n  being fit for purpose, but it's pretty absurd to do this","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2bc83ba6-e232-47c3-9968-6013e37b0825"}
