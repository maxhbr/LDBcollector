Secondarily,\nthis License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit\nfor their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\ndesigned for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it\ncan be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n=============================\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the\nterms of this License.  The \"Document\", below, refers to any such\nmanual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n   A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\n\n   The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.\n\n   A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the general\npublic, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to\ntext formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\nwhose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent\nmodification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not\n\"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or\nXML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML\ndesigned for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,\nPDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated\nHTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2061c192-99a0-436c-acaf-6b43c4ab3d9f"}
