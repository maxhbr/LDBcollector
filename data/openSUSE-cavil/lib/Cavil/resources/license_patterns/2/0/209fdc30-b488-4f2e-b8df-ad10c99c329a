{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0+ OR Commercial","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Usage license:\n=============================================================================\n\nCopyright  $SKIP19\n\n  This library is distributed under two distinct usage licenses depending\non the software (\"Software\" below) which uses the Function Parser library\n(\"Library\" below).\n  The reason for having two distinct usage licenses is to make the library\ncompatible with the GPL license while still being usable in other non-GPL\n(even commercial) software.\n\nA) If the Software using the Library is distributed under the GPL license,\n   then the Library can be used under the GPL license as well.\n\n   The Library will be under the GPL license only when used with the\n   Software. If the Library is separated from the Software and used in\n   another different software under a different license, then the Library\n   will have the B) license below.\n\n   Exception to the above: If the Library is modified for the GPL Software,\n   then the Library cannot be used with the B) license without the express\n   permission of the author of the modifications. A modified library will\n   be under the GPL license by default. That is, only the original,\n   unmodified version of the Library can be taken to another software\n   with the B) license below.\n\n   The author of the Software should provide an URL to the original\n   version of the Library if the one used in the Software has been\n   modified. (http:\/\/iki.fi\/warp\/FunctionParser\/)\n\n   This text file must be distributed in its original intact form along\n   with the sources of the Library. (Documentation about possible\n   modifications to the library should be put in a different text file.)\n\nB) If the Software using the Library is not distributed under the GPL\n   license but under any other license, then the following usage license\n   applies to the Library:\n\n  1. This library is free for non-commercial usage. You can do whatever you\n     like with it as long as you don't claim you made it yourself.\n\n  2. It is possible to use this library in a commercial program, but in this\n     case you MUST contact me first (warp@iki.fi) and ask express permission\n     for this. (Read explanation at the end of the file.)\n       If you are making a free program or a shareware program with just a\n     nominal price (5 US dollars or less), you don't have to ask for\n     permission.\n       In any case, I DON'T WANT MONEY for the usage of this library. It is\n     free, period.\n\n  3. You can make any modifications you want to it so that it conforms your\n     needs. If you make modifications to it, you have, of course, credits for\n     the modified parts.\n\n  4. If you use this library in your own program, you don't have to provide\n     the source code if you don't want to (ie. the source code of your program\n     or this library).\n       If you DO include the source code for this library, this text file\n     must be included in its original intact form.\n\n  5. If you distribute a program which uses this library, and specially if you\n     provide the source code, proper credits MUST be included. Trying to\n     obfuscate the fact that this library is not made by you or that it is\n     free is expressly prohibited. When crediting the usage of this library,\n     it's enough to include my name and email address, that is:\n     \"Juha Nieminen (warp@iki.fi)\". Also a URL to the library download page\n     would be nice, although not required. The official URL is:\n       http:\/\/iki.fi\/warp\/FunctionParser\/\n\n  6. And the necessary \"lawyer stuff\":\n\n     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\n     included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n     The software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind,\n     express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of\n     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.\n     In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any\n     claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,\n     tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the\n     software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n\n---  Explanation of the section 2 of the B) license above:\n\n  The section 2 tries to define \"fair use\" of the library in commercial\nprograms.\n  \"Fair use\" of the library means that the program is not heavily dependent\non the library, but the library only provides a minor secondary feature\nto the program.\n  \"Heavily dependent\" means that the program depends so much on the library\nthat without it the functionality of the program would be seriously\ndegraded or the program would even become completely non-functional.\n\n  In other words: If the program does not depend heavily on the library,\nthat is, the library only provides a minor secondary feature which could\nbe removed without the program being degraded in any considerable way,\nthen it's OK to use the library in the commercial program.\n  If, however, the program depends so heavily on the library that\nremoving it would make the program non-functional or degrade its\nfunctionality considerably, then it's NOT OK to use the library.\n\n  The ideology behind this is that it's not fair to use a free library\nas a base for a commercial program, but it's fair if the library is\njust a minor, unimportant extra.\n\n  If you are going to ask me for permission to use the library in a\ncommercial program, please describe the feature which the library will\nbe providing and how important it is to the program","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"209fdc30-b488-4f2e-b8df-ad10c99c329a"}
