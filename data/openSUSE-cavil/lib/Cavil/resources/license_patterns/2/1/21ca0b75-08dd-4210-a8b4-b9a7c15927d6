Mission and Scope of the Project\r\n\r\n  * **a.** The mission of the Project is to develop an open source project\r\n    with the goals indicated in the \"README\" file within the Project's code\r\n    repository.\r\n\r\n  * **b.** The scope of the Project includes software development under an\r\n    OSI-approved open source license supporting the mission, including\r\n    documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts\r\n    that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open\r\n    source software project.\r\n\r\n### 2. Technical Steering Committee\r\n\r\n  * **a.** The Technical Steering Committee (the \"TSC\") will be responsible\r\n    for all technical oversight of the open source Project.\r\n\r\n  * **b.** The TSC voting members are initially the Project's Committers. At\r\n    the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as\r\n    set forth within the \"GOVERNANCE\" file within the Project's code\r\n    repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining\r\n    the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be\r\n    documented in the GOVERNANCE file. Any meetings of the Technical\r\n    Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be\r\n    conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.\r\n\r\n  * **c.** TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers.\r\n    The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in\r\n    the GOVERNANCE file. Unless otherwise documented:\r\n\r\n    - **i.** Contributors include anyone in the technical community that\r\n      contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the\r\n      Project;\r\n\r\n    - **ii.** Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to\r\n      modify (\"commit\") source code, documentation or other technical\r\n      artifacts in a project's repository; and\r\n\r\n    - **iii.** A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval\r\n      of the existing Committers or at the discretion of the TSC. A\r\n      Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing\r\n      Committers, or at the discretion of the TSC.\r\n\r\n  * **d.** Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and\r\n    Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this\r\n    Charter.\r\n\r\n  * **e.** The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission,\r\n    approval, and closure\/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for\r\n    the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and\r\n    (3) amend, adjust, refine and\/or eliminate the roles of Contributors,\r\n    and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC\r\n    roles, as it sees fit.\r\n\r\n  * **f.** The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of\r\n    the TSC and will serve until his or her resignation or replacement by\r\n    the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the\r\n    TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project\r\n    and the Academy Software Foundation Fund of The Linux Foundation.\r\n\r\n  * **g.** Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of\r\n    oversight relating to the Project, which may include:\r\n\r\n    - **i.** coordinating the technical direction of the Project;\r\n\r\n    - **ii.** approving project or system proposals (including, but not\r\n      limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project's\r\n      scope);\r\n\r\n    - **iii.** organizing sub-projects and removing projects;\r\n\r\n    - **iv.** creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on\r\n      cross-project technical issues and requirements;\r\n\r\n    - **v.** appointing representatives to work with other open source or\r\n      open standards communities;\r\n\r\n    - **vi.** establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and\r\n      security issue reporting policies;\r\n\r\n    - **vii.** approving and implementing policies and processes for\r\n      contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and\r\n      coordinating with the Series Manager to resolve matters or concerns\r\n      that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;\r\n\r\n    - **viii.** discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting\r\n      on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple\r\n      projects; and\r\n\r\n    - **ix.** coordinating any marketing, events, or communications\r\n      regarding the Project with the LF Projects Manager or their designee.\r\n\r\n### 3.
