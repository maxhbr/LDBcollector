This General\r\nPublic License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other\r\nprogram whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software\r\nis covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\r\nprograms, too.\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public\r\nLicenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free\r\nsoftware (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if\r\nyou want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\r\nthat you know you can do these things.\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights\r\nor to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\r\nfor you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\r\ngive the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\r\ncan get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license\r\nwhich gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\nAlso, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else\r\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that\r\nany problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the\r\ndanger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect\r\nmaking the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\r\nbe licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTerms and Conditions For Copying,\r\nDistribution and Modification\r\n48\r\n\r\n\f0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed\r\nby the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General\r\nPublic License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a\r\n“work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under\r\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\r\nverbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\r\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is\r\naddressed as “you”.\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this\r\nLicense; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\r\nand the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\non the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether\r\nthat is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish\r\non each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give\r\nany other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\r\noption offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a\r\nwork based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\r\nthe terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n(a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you\r\nchanged the files and the date of any change.\r\n(b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part\r\ncontains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a\r\nwhole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n(c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\r\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\r\nway, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\r\nnotice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\r\nwarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\r\nand telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\r\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\r\nyour work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\r\nof that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\r\nindependent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\r\napply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program,\r\nthe distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\r\nfor other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\r\nof who wrote it.\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to\r\nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the\r\ndistribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\r\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution\r\nmedium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2)\r\nin object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided\r\nthat you also do one of the following:\r\n(a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\r\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n\f(b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third\r\nparty, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable \r\ncopy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\r\nused for software interchange; or,\r\n(c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute\r\ncorresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\r\ndistribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable\r\nform with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, \r\ncomplete source code means all the source code\r\nfor all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\r\nused to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed \r\nneed not include anything that is normally\r\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\r\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\r\ncomponent itself accompanies the executable.\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from\r\na designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the\r\nsame place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or\r\ndistribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\r\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\r\ncompliance.\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\r\nnothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative\r\nworks. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\r\nby modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you\r\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for\r\ncopying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the\r\nrecipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute\r\nor modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose\r\nany further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are\r\nnot responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any\r\nother reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by\r\ncourt order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they\r\ndo not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as\r\nto satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\r\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For\r\nexample, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program\r\nby all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way\r\nyou could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution\r\nof the Program.\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular\r\ncircumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole\r\nis intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other\r\nproperty right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the\r\nsole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\r\nis implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \r\ndistributed through that system in reliance on\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\n\fconsistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or\r\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence\r\nof the rest of this License.\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\r\nby patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the\r\nProgram under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\r\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written\r\nin the body of this License.\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General\r\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\r\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version\r\nnumber of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option\r\nof following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, \r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. For software\r\nwhich is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions \r\nfor this. Our decision will be guided by the two\r\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\r\nthe sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNo Warranty\r\n11. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the\r\nprogram, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise\r\nstated in writing the copyright holders and\/or other parties provide the\r\nprogram “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,\r\nincluding, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and\r\nfitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should \r\nthe program prove defective,\r\nyou assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.\r\n12. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any\r\ncopyright holder, or any other party who may modify and\/or redistribute\r\nthe program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any\r\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use\r\nor inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or\r\ndata being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or\r\na failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such\r\nholder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\nEnd of Terms and Conditions\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\n\fAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your\r\nNew Programs\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,\r\nthe best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\r\nchange under these terms.\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start\r\nof each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\r\nhave at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\none line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) yyyy name of author\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\r\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU \r\nGeneral\r\nPublic License for more details.\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\r\nthis program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple\r\nPlace - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an\r\ninteractive mode:\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) yyyy name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\r\n‘show w’.\r\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the\r\nGeneral Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\r\nthan show w and show c; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items—whatever suits\r\nyour program.\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to\r\nsign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n‘Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary\r\nprograms. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit\r\nlinking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU\r\nLibrary General Public License instead of this License.\r\n","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2150f1af-c368-402b-9bc3-bb2afd914ee2"}
