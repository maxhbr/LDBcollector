ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE\nPROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1.  DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:  \n    a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"), \n       the Original Program, and \n    b) in the case of each Contributor, \n       i)  changes to the Program, and\n       ii) additions to the Program;\n           where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate\n           from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.  \n           A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added \n           to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on \n           such Contributor's behalf.  \n    Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n       (i)  are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction \n            with the Program under their own license agreement, and \n       (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying\nthis Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code\nand documentation, if any.\n\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, \nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2.  GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n    object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n    if any, in source code and object code form.  This patent license\n    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n    by the Licensed Patents.  The patent license shall not apply to any\n    other combinations which include the Contribution.  No hardware per\n    se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n    Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n    brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n    property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights\n    and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n    responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n    needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent license\n    is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n    Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing\n    the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3.  REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form \nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n    b) its license agreement:\n       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n            warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n            implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n            for a particular purpose;\n       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all \n            liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, \n            incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; \n       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement \n            are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other \n            party; and\n       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from \n            such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a \n            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for \n            software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the \n       Program.  \n\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location \nin the Program: \n\n    Copyright (c) 1997,1998,1999, International Business Machines\n    Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of\nits Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. \n\n4.  COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like.  While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\nContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\nshould do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\nother Contributors.   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\na commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\")\nhereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n(\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs\n(collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\nthe extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\nin connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering.  The obligations in this section do not apply to any\nclaims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n    a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand \n    b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n       the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related \n       settlement negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may \n       participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X.  That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor.  If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone.  Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those\ndamages.\n\n5.  NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\nON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\nCONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\nthe appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\nall risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\nequipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. \n\n6.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\nOF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7.  GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\nContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate\nas of the date such litigation is filed.  In addition, If Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\nor counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding\ncombinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\nsuch Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\nto comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\nand does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\nbecoming aware of such noncompliance.  If all Recipient's rights under\nthis Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\nof the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.  However, Recipient's\nobligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\nrelating to the Program shall continue and survive. \n\nIBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\nfrom time to time.  Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.  The Program (including Contributions)\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under\nwhich it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\nis published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including\nits Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the\nright to modify this Agreement.  Except as expressly stated in Sections\n2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\nintellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\nexpressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\nthis Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\none year after the cause of action arose.
