By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\r\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\r\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\r\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\r\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\r\ncovered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\r\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\r\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\r\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\r\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\r\ndo these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\r\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\r\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\r\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\r\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\r\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\r\nthese terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\r\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or\r\nmodify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\r\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\r\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\r\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\r\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\r\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\r\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\r\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\r\nuse or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\r\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\r\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\r\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\r\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\r\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\r\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\r\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\r\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\r\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\r\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\r\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\r\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program\r\na copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\r\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\r\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\r\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\r\nalso meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\r\n    you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\r\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\r\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\r\n    this License.\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\r\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\r\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\r\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\r\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\r\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\r\n    of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\r\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\r\n    not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\r\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\r\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\r\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\r\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\r\nwhich is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on\r\nthe terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\r\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\r\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\r\nProgram.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\r\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\r\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\r\nabove provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\r\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\r\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\r\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\r\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\r\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\r\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\r\n    noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object\r\n    code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b\r\n    above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\r\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\r\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\r\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\r\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\r\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\r\naccompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\r\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\r\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\r\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\r\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\r\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\r\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\r\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\r\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\r\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do\r\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\r\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\r\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\r\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\r\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\r\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\r\nparties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\r\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\r\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\r\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\r\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\r\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\r\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\r\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\r\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\ndistribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\r\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\r\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\r\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\r\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\r\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\r\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\r\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\r\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\r\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\r\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\r\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\r\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\r\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\r\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\r\nor concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\r\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\r\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\r\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\r\nProgram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\r\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\r\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\r\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\r\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\r\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\r\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\r\nsoftware generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\r\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\r\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\r\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\r\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\r\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\r\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\r\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\r\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\r\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\r\nto the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\r\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\r\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\r\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\r\npointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\r\n    Copyright (C) yyyy name of author\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\n    as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\n    of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\r\nstarts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\n    type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome\r\n    to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\r\n    for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\r\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c' ; they could even be mouse-\r\nclicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is\r\na sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\n    interest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n    (which makes passes at compilers) written\r\n    by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\r\nit more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\r\nthis is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\r\nof this License","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2dfce370-e215-4ef8-b21c-6521dcc0c9e7"}
