It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n<\/para>\n<para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n<\/para>\n<\/listitem><listitem><para>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n<\/para>\n<para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The &#8220;Document&#8221;, below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n<\/para>\n<para>A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n<\/para>\n<para>A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#8217;s overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n<\/para>\n<para>The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.

If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n<\/para>\n<para>The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.

A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.\n<\/para>\n<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nascii without markup, Texinfo input format, La&tex; input\nformat, <acronym>SGML<\/acronym> or <acronym>XML<\/acronym> using a publicly available\n<acronym>DTD<\/acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML<\/acronym>,\nPostScript or <acronym>PDF<\/acronym> designed for human modification.
