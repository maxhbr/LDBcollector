The relationship could be a matter\r\n of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of\r\n legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\r\n them.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\r\n designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\r\n that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\r\n Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\r\n Document is released under this License.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented\r\n in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose\r\n contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic\r\n text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs\r\n or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable\r\n for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety\r\n of formats suitable for input to text formatters.\r\n A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been\r\n designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\r\n not Transparent.\r\n A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\r\n without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using\r\n a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed\r\n for human modification.\r\n Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be\r\n read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\r\n the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-ge\r\nnerated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus\r\n such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this\r\n License requires to appear in the title page.\r\n For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\"\r\n means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\r\n preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n2.\r\n VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\r\n or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,\r\n and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are\r\n reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever\r\n to those of this License.\r\n You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or\r\n further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\r\n However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.\r\n If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow\r\n the conditions in section 3.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you\r\n may publicly display copies.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n3.\r\n COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and\r\n the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\r\n copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:\r\n Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back\r\n cover.\r\n Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\r\n of these copies.\r\n The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\r\n equally prominent and visible.\r\n You may add other material on the covers in addition.\r\n Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\r\n title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim\r\n copying in other respects.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,\r\n you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the\r\n actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\r\n than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\r\n with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessib\r\nle computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the\r\n Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public\r\n has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network\r\n protocols.\r\n If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when\r\n you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\r\n Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until\r\n at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\r\n or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document\r\n well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\r\n to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n4.\r\n MODIFICATIONS\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\r\n conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\r\n Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling\r\n the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification\r\n of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.\r\n In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nA.\r\n Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\r\n that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,\r\n if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).\r\n You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher\r\n of that version gives permission.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nB.\r\n List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible\r\n for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with\r\n at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal\r\n authors, if it has less than five).\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nC.\r\n State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\r\n as the publisher.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nD.\r\n Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nE.\r\n Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to\r\n the other copyright notices.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nF.\r\n Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\r\n the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\r\n License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nG.\r\n Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\r\n required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nH.\r\n Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nI.\r\n Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to it an\r\n item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\r\n Modified Version as given on the Title Page.\r\n If there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating\r\n the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its\r\n Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated\r\n in the previous sentence.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nJ.\r\n Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\r\n access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\r\n locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\r\n These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\r\n You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least\r\n four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of\r\n the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nK.\r\n In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", preserve the\r\n section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone\r\n of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nL.\r\n Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\r\n text and in their titles.\r\n Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section\r\n titles.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nM.\r\n Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".\r\n Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Itemize\r\nN.\r\n Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in\r\n title with any Invariant Section.\r\n \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices\r\n that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from\r\n the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections\r\n as invariant.\r\n To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\r\n Version's license notice.\r\n These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\r\n but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\r\n statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization\r\n as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage\r\n of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover\r\n Texts in the Modified Version.\r\n Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\r\n added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.\r\n If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously\r\n added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on\r\n behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on\r\n explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\r\n permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorseme\r\nnt of any Modified Version.\r\n \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n5.\r\n COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\r\n under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided\r\n that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all\r\n of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections\r\n of your combined work in its license notice.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\r\n identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.\r\n If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different\r\n contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end\r\n of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of\r\n that section if known, or else a unique number.\r\n Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant\r\n Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in\r\n the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"History\";\r\n likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections\r\n entitled \"Dedications\".\r\n You must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n6.\r\n COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\n released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\n License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\r\n the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\r\n verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\r\n it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\r\n License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other\r\n respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n7.\r\n AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\r\n independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\r\n medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,\r\n provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.\r\n Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this License does not\r\n apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document,\r\n on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative\r\n works of the Document.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies\r\n of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire\r\n aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround\r\n only the Document within the aggregate.\r\n Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n8.\r\n TRANSLATION\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\r\n translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\r\n Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission\r\n from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some\r\n or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these\r\n Invariant Sections.\r\n You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include\r\n the original English version of this License.\r\n In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English\r\n version of this License, the original English version will prevail.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n9.\r\n TERMINATION\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\r\n as expressly provided for under this License.\r\n Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document\r\n is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\n However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\r\n License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\r\n remain in full compliance.\r\n \r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Section*\r\n10.\r\n FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\r\n Free Documentation License from time to time.\r\n Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\r\n may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\\end_layout\r\n\r\n\\begin_layout Standard\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\r\n If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License\r\n \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following\r\n the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later\r\n version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundatio\r\nn.\r\n If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you\r\n may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software\r\n Foundation.\r\n\\end_layout","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"24b06e86-ac5e-498a-9d61-17f0b488edf1"}
