Under this\nsection, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the\nother Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.<\/span> <\/p>\n\n<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>5.
