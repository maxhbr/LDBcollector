{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.3+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"GNU Free Documentation License\r\nVersion 1.3, 3 November 2008\r\nCopyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n<http:\/\/fsf.org\/>\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\r\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n0. PREAMBLE\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document\r\n\"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\r\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License\r\npreserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered\r\nresponsible for modifications made by others.\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must\r\nthemselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a\r\ncopyleft license designed for free software.\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software\r\nneeds free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms\r\nthat the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any\r\ntextual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We\r\nrecommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by\r\nthe copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants\r\na world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated\r\nherein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a\r\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work\r\nin a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,\r\neither copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals\r\nexclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's\r\noverall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\r\nsubject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not\r\nexplain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the\r\nsubject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\r\nregarding them.\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those\r\nof Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a\r\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\r\nInvariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any\r\nInvariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\npage II\r\n\r\n\fThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or BackCover Texts, in the \r\nnotice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover\r\nText may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format\r\nwhose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document\r\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\r\nprograms or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to\r\ntext formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\r\nformatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of\r\nmarkup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not\r\nTransparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy\r\nthat is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo\r\ninput format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript \r\nor PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\r\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats\r\nthat can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD\r\nand\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or\r\nPDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are\r\nneeded to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\r\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most\r\nprominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely\r\nXYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here\r\nXYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\r\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you\r\nmodify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License\r\napplies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in\r\nthis License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty\r\nDisclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially,\r\nprovided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\r\nthe Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to\r\nthose of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or\r\nfurther copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in\r\nexchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the\r\nconditions in section 3.\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display\r\ncopies.\r\npage III\r\n\r\n\f3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the\r\nDocument, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you\r\nmust enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover\r\nTexts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly\r\nand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title\r\nwith all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in\r\naddition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\r\nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones\r\nlisted (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must\r\neither include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\r\neach Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\r\naccess to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the\r\nDocument, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent\r\nsteps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy\r\nwill remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you\r\ndistribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before\r\nredistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated\r\nversion of the Document.\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2\r\nand 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the\r\nModified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\r\nModified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the\r\nModified Version:\r\n• A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document,\r\nand from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History\r\nsection of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original\r\npublisher of that version gives permission.\r\n• B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for\r\nauthorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the\r\nprincipal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless\r\nthey release you from this requirement.\r\n• C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the\r\npublisher.\r\n• D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n• E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright\r\nnotices.\r\n• F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public\r\npermission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in\r\nthe Addendum below.\r\n• G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts\r\ngiven in the Document's license notice.\r\n• H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n• I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at\r\npage IV\r\n\r\n\f•\r\n\r\n•\r\n\r\n•\r\n•\r\n•\r\n•\r\n\r\nleast the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title\r\nPage. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title,\r\nyear, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item\r\ndescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a\r\nTransparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the\r\nDocument for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\"\r\nsection. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years\r\nbefore the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives\r\npermission.\r\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the\r\nsection, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor\r\nacknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their\r\ntitles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the\r\nModified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with\r\nany Invariant Section.\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary\r\nSections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some\r\nor all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the\r\nModified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of\r\nyour Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text\r\nhas been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words\r\nas a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one\r\npassage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through\r\narrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same\r\ncover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf\r\nof, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the\r\nprevious publisher that added the old one.\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their\r\nnames for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms\r\ndefined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of\r\nthe Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\r\nSections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty\r\nDisclaimers.\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant\r\nSections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same\r\nname but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\r\nparentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique\r\npage V\r\n\r\n\fnumber. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license\r\nnotice of the combined work.\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original\r\ndocuments, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\r\n\"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled\r\n\"Endorsements\".\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this\r\nLicense, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\r\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\r\ncopying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this\r\nLicense, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\r\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or\r\nworks, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the\r\ncopyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this\r\nLicense does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative\r\nworks of the Document.\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the\r\nDocument is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed\r\non covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\r\nthe Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the\r\nwhole aggregate.\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document\r\nunder the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\r\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\r\nSections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a\r\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty\r\nDisclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the\r\noriginal versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation\r\nand the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the\r\nrequirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided\r\nunder this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\r\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright\r\nholder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\r\npage VI\r\n\r\n\fterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright\r\nholder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received\r\nnotice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\r\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have\r\nreceived copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not\r\npermanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any\r\nrights to use it.\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation\r\nLicense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that\r\na particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option\r\nof following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\r\nbeen published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a\r\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the\r\nFree Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\r\nof this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\r\nauthorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\r\n11. RELICENSING\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that\r\npublishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those\r\nworks. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor\r\nCollaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus\r\npublished on the MMC site.\r\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by\r\nCreative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in\r\nSan Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same\r\norganization.\r\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another\r\nDocument.\r\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were\r\nfirst published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in\r\nwhole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus\r\nincorporated prior to November 1, 2008","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2554d5c0-59eb-4c18-b200-83f3d04473e0"}
