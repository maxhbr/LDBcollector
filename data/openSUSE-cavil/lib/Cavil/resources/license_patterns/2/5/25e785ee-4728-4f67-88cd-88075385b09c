Documentation is an essential part of any software\npackage; when an important free software package does not come with a\nfree manual, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.\n<\/p><p>\nOnce upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl.  I got\na copy of a free manual, but I found it hard to read.  When I asked\nPerl users about alternatives, they told me that there were better\nintroductory manuals--but those were not free.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy was this?  The authors of the good manuals had written them for\nO'Reilly Associates, which published them with restrictive terms--no\ncopying, no modification, source files not available--which exclude\nthem from the free software community.\n<\/p><p>\nThat wasn't the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to\nour community's great loss) it was far from the last.  Proprietary\nmanual publishers have enticed a great many authors to restrict their\nmanuals since then.  Many times I have heard a GNU user eagerly tell\nme about a manual that he is writing, with which he expects to help\nthe GNU project--and then had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to\nexplain that he had signed a contract with a publisher that would\nrestrict it so that we cannot use it.\n<\/p><p>\nGiven that writing good English is a rare skill among programmers, we\ncan ill afford to lose manuals this way.\n<\/p><p> \n  Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom,\nnot price.  The problem with these manuals was not that O'Reilly\nAssociates charged a price for printed copies--that in itself is fine.\n(The Free Software Foundation <a class=\"ulink\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/doc\/doc.html\" target=\"_top\">sells printed copies<\/a> of\nfree GNU manuals, too.)  But GNU manuals are available in source code\nform, while these manuals are available only on paper.  GNU manuals\ncome with permission to copy and modify; the Perl manuals do not.\nThese restrictions are the problems.\n<\/p><p>\nThe criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free\nsoftware: it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms.\nRedistribution (including commercial redistribution) must be\npermitted, so that the manual can accompany every copy of the program,\non-line or on paper.  Permission for modification is crucial too.\n<\/p><p>\nAs a general rule, I don't believe that it is essential for people to\nhave permission to modify all sorts of articles and books.  The issues\nfor writings are not necessarily the same as those for software.  For\nexample, I don't think you or I are obliged to give permission to\nmodify articles like this one, which describe our actions and our\nviews.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial\nfor documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right\nto modify the software, and add or change its features, if they are\nconscientious they will change the manual too--so they can provide\naccurate and usable documentation with the modified program.  A manual\nwhich forbids programmers to be conscientious and finish the job, or\nmore precisely requires them to write a new manual from scratch if\nthey change the program, does not fill our community's needs.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some\nkinds of limits on the method of modification pose no problem.  For\nexample, requirements to preserve the original author's copyright\nnotice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are ok.  It is\nalso no problem to require modified versions to include notice that\nthey were modified, even to have entire sections that may not be\ndeleted or changed, as long as these sections deal with nontechnical\ntopics.  (Some GNU manuals have them.)\n<\/p><p>\nThese kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical\nmatter, they don't stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the\nmanual to fit the modified program.  In other words, they don't block\nthe free software community from making full use of the manual.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, it must be possible to modify all the <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>technical<\/em><\/span>\ncontent of the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual\nmedia, through all the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do\nblock the community, the manual is not free, and so we need another\nmanual.\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another\nmanual when a proprietary manual exists.  The obstacle is that many\nusers think that a proprietary manual is good enough--so they don't\nsee the need to write a free manual.  They do not see that the free\noperating system has a gap that needs filling.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough?  Some\nhave not considered the issue.  I hope this article will do something\nto change that.\n<\/p><p>\nOther users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same\nreason so many people consider proprietary software acceptable: they\njudge in purely practical terms, not using freedom as a criterion.\nThese people are entitled to their opinions, but since those opinions\nspring from values which do not include freedom, they are no guide for\nthose of us who do value freedom.\n<\/p><p>\nPlease spread the word about this issue.  We continue to lose manuals\nto proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that proprietary\nmanuals are not sufficient, perhaps the next person who wants to help\nGNU by writing documentation will realize, before it is too late, that\nhe must above all make it free.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted\nmanuals instead of proprietary ones.  One way you can help this is to\ncheck the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and\nprefer copylefted manuals to non-copylefted ones.\n<\/p><p>\n[Note: We now maintain a <a class=\"ulink\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/licensing\/doc\/other-free-books.html\" target=\"_top\">web page\nthat lists free books available from other publishers<\/a>].\n<\/p><p>Copyright Â© 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<\/p><p>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article are\npermitted worldwide, without royalty, in any medium, provided this","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"25e785ee-4728-4f67-88cd-88075385b09c"}
