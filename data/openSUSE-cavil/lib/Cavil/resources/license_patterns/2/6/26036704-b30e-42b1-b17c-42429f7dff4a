{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"GNU Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification\n\n0.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program,\" below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you.\"\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a)  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b)  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\n    or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\n    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms\n    of this License.\n\n    c)  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nwork.  But when you distribute the same section as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3.  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b)  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to \n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically \n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the \n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c)  Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"26036704-b30e-42b1-b17c-42429f7dff4a"}
