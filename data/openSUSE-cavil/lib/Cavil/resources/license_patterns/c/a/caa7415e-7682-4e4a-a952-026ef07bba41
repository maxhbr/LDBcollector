YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE AND THE\r\nRESULTS ACHIEVED.

Limitation of Liability. DELL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA AND\/OR THE SOFTWARE. DELL SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR THE\r\nFOLLOWING: (A) LOSS OF REVENUE, INCOME, PROFIT, OR SAVINGS, (B) LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR SOFTWARE, LOSS OF USE OF\r\nSYSTEM(S) OR NETWORK(S), OR THE RECOVERY OF SUCH, (C) LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, (D) BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR\r\nDOWNTIME, (E) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, OR (F) SOFTWARE NOT BEING AVAILABLE FOR USE OR THE PROCUREMENT OF\r\nSUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR GOODS.\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS EULA, DELL’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND\r\nALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA AND\/OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE\r\nTOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY DELL FOR THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM(S).\r\nThe foregoing limitations, exclusions and disclaimers shall apply to any and all claims, regardless of whether the claim(s)\r\nfor such damages is based in contract, warranty, strict liability, negligence, tort or otherwise. Insofar as applicable law\r\nprohibits any limitation on liability herein, the parties agree that such limitation will be automatically modified, but only to\r\nthe extent so as to make the limitation compliant with applicable law. The parties agree that the limitations on liabilities\r\nset forth herein are agreed allocations of risk and such limitations will apply notwithstanding the failure of essential\r\npurpose of any limited remedy and even if a party has been advised of the possibility of any such liability.\r\nDELL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM BROUGHT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE CAUSE OF\r\nACTION FOR SUCH CLAIM FIRST AROSE.\r\n11. Indemnification. Except where prohibited by applicable law, Dell shall defend and indemnify you against any third-party claim or action\r\nthat the Software (specifically excluding open source software) infringes or misappropriates that third party’s patent, copyright, trade\r\nsecret, or other intellectual property rights (“Indemnified Claims”). In addition, if Dell receives prompt notice of an Indemnified Claim that,\r\nin Dell’s reasonable opinion, is likely to result in an adverse ruling, then Dell shall at its sole discretion, (A) obtain a right for you to\r\ncontinue using such Software; (B) modify such Software to be non-infringing; (C) replace such Software with a non-infringing substitute;\r\nor (D) provide a reasonable depreciated refund for the allegedly infringing Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dell shall have no\r\nobligation under this Section for Indemnified Claims resulting or arising from: (i) modifications of the Software that were not performed\r\nby or on behalf of Dell; (ii) your unauthorized use of the Software, or the combination or operation of the Software in connection with a\r\nthird-party product, software, or service (the combination of which causes the claimed infringement); (iii) your failure to incorporate free\r\nSoftware updates or upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (iv) Dell’s compliance with your written\r\nspecifications or directions, including the incorporation of any software or other materials or processes provided by or requested by you\r\n(collectively, “Excluded Indemnified Claims”). Dell’s duty to indemnify and defend is contingent upon: (a) your providing Dell with\r\nprompt written notice of the third-party claim or action, (b) Dell having the right to solely control the defense and settlement of such\r\nclaim or action, and (c) your cooperation with Dell in defending and resolving such claim or action. This Section states your exclusive\r\nremedies for any third-party claim or action, and nothing in this EULA or elsewhere will obligate Dell to provide any greater indemnity to\r\nyou. You, at your expense, shall defend and indemnify Dell against any claim, action or proceeding brought against Dell which arises\r\nfrom or is in any manner connected with the Excluded Indemnified Claims.\r\n12. Confidentiality. You agree to: (A) not use Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise the rights herein and (B) use best\r\nefforts to preserve and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. \"Confidential Information\" means any oral, written,\r\ngraphic or machine-readable information disclosed by Dell that is (i) identified as confidential; (ii) designated in writing to be confidential\r\nor proprietary; or (iii) should be reasonably understood to be confidential. Confidential Information includes the Software and its trade\r\nsecrets, including but not limited to source code, the development status of the Software, the appearance, content and flow of the user\r\ninterface of the Software, and the content and documentation of the Software. Confidential Information does not include information\r\nthat is (a) publicly available other than through a breach of this EULA; (b) known to you prior to such disclosure; or (c) subsequently\r\nlawfully obtained by you from a third party that has no obligations of confidentiality. You agree that, without Dell’s prior written consent,\r\nyou will not grant access to any Dell Confidential Information to any persons or entities except for your employees and agents who have\r\na business need to have such access and who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality thereof as set forth herein. These obligations\r\ndo not expire. In some, limited circumstances, Dell may need to engage a third party to fulfill its obligations to you under this EULA. By\r\n\r\nVersion 1.6\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\nDell Inc.\r\n\r\n\fusing this Software you agree that Dell may provide your information to such third party for that purpose. Dell may obtain information\r\nrelated to your use of the Software and you agree that we may use such information in aggregate form in an anonymous manner in\r\nsupport of our marketing activities related to the Software. Any feedback, value added changes or suggestions made by you or other\r\ninformation that is provided to Dell relating to the Software shall be owned by Dell and considered Dell Confidential Information.\r\n\r\n13. Development Tools. If the Software includes development tools, such as scripting tools, APIs, or sample scripts\r\n(collectively “Development Tools”), you may use such Development Tools to create new scripts and code for the purpose\r\nof customizing your use of the Software (within the parameters set forth in this EULA and within the parameters set forth\r\nin the Development Tools themselves) and for no other purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in\r\nthis EULA, no warranty or technical support is provided for sample scripts contained in such Development Tools or scripts\r\nor other code written by you or any third party.\r\n14. Evaluation Licenses.

You acknowledge that Dell may terminate\r\nyour right to evaluate the Evaluation Software, for any or no reason, effective immediately upon notice to you. IN ADDITION, THE\r\nEVALUATION SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS\" WITHOUT INDEMNITY OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\nIMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA, DELL BEARS NO LIABILITY\r\nFOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM USE (OR ATTEMPTED\r\nUSE) OF THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE THROUGH AND AFTER THE EVALUATION PERIOD AND HAS NO DUTY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT\r\nTO YOU.\r\n\r\n15. Hosted and Internet-Accessible Software. Some or all of the Software may be remotely hosted or accessible to you\r\nthrough the Internet (“Hosted Software”). In such case, Dell may suspend, terminate, withdraw, or discontinue all or part of\r\nthe Hosted Software or your access to the Hosted Software upon receipt of a subpoena or law-enforcement request, or\r\nwhen Dell believes, in its sole discretion, that you have breached any term of this EULA or are involved in any fraudulent,\r\nmisleading, or illegal activities. Dell may modify the Hosted Software at any time with or without prior notice to you. Dell\r\nmay perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs or maintenance, or remotely patch or upgrade the Hosted Software\r\ninstalled on its and your system(s), which may temporarily degrade the quality of the Hosted Software or result in a partial\r\nor complete outage of the Hosted Software. Updates, patches or alerts may be delivered from Dell servers, which may be\r\nlocated outside of your country. Dell provides no assurance that you will receive advance notification of such activities or\r\nthat your use of the Hosted Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.\r\n16. Open Source Software. The Software may come bundled or otherwise be distributed with open source software, which is subject to the\r\nterms and conditions of the specific license under which the open source software is distributed.

NOTWITHSTANDING\r\nANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA, AS IT RELATES TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH\r\nOPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, DELL SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Under certain open source software licenses, you are entitled to obtain the corresponding source files. You\r\nmay find corresponding source files for the Software at http:\/\/opensource.dell.com or other locations that may be specified to you by\r\nDell.\r\n\r\n17. Right to Preliminary and Injunctive Relief. You agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for Dell in\r\nthe event of a breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions set forth in this EULA; therefore, you agree that in the\r\nevent of a breach or threatened breach of any such provisions, Dell may, in addition to any other remedies to which it is\r\nentitled, be entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting you from taking actions in\r\nbreach of such provisions) and specific performance as may be appropriate to preserve all of Dell’s rights. All rights and\r\nremedies afforded Dell by law shall be cumulative and not exclusive.\r\n18. Choice of Law and Language. This EULA shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, to the exclusion of the UN\r\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You acknowledge that the headquarters of the Dell family of companies is\r\nlocated in Texas, and that the software licensed under this EULA and the related products marketed in connection with such software\r\nwere in substantial part conceived, developed, and marketed by Dell personnel in Texas. Further, you acknowledge, agree, and stipulate\r\nthat the laws of the State of Texas bear a substantial relationship to this EULA and that the selection of Texas law to govern this EULA and\r\nthe license of the Software hereunder is reasonable and appropriate, and you consent to the selection of such law to govern this EULA\r\nand the relationship of the parties hereto. This EULA has been agreed only in the English language, which version of this EULA shall be\r\ncontrolling regardless of whether any translations of this EULA have been prepared or exchanged. As an exception to the preceding\r\nsentence, if Dell provides this EULA to you only in a non-English language version, then such non-English language version shall control.\r\nYou acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed this EULA with the involvement and assistance of your employees,\r\nadvisors, and\/or legal counsel fluent in the English language, that you have consulted with local legal counsel and counsel competent to\r\nrender advice with respect to transactions governed by the law applicable to this EULA, that you have no questions regarding the\r\nmeaning or effect of any of this EULA’s terms, and that you have obtained high-quality translations of this EULA for use by you or any of\r\nyour team who are not fluent in the English language, with the understanding that you alone shall bear the risk of any misunderstandings\r\nthat may arise as a result of such translation. All communications in connection with this EULA shall be in the English language.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.6\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\nDell Inc.\r\n\r\n\fLes parties ont demandé que cette convention ainsi que tous les documents qui s'y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.\r\n19. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration. ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR\r\nOTHERWISE, WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND\r\nEQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND DELL arising out of or in connection with this EULA, or the breach, termination or validity\r\nthereof shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by one or more arbitrators\r\nwith expertise in software licensing appointed in accordance with such rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.\r\nThe place of the arbitration shall be a commercial center reasonably chosen by the arbitration panel in a third country so as to ensure\r\nthat the award resulting from the arbitration shall be of an international character and enforceable under the New York Convention on\r\nthe Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The arbitration panel shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would\r\nbe available in court, including without limitation preliminary relief, injunctive relief, and specific performance. Any award of the\r\narbitration panel shall be final and binding immediately when rendered, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction. Neither you nor Dell shall be entitled to join, consolidate, or include any claims belonging to or alleged or arising\r\nfrom, by, or on behalf of any third party to an arbitration brought hereunder. The individual (non-class) nature of this dispute resolution\r\nprovision goes to the essence of the parties' dispute resolution agreement, and if found unenforceable, the entire arbitration and dispute\r\nresolution provision shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dell may apply to any relevant government agency or any court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction to preserve its rights under this EULA and to obtain any injunctive or preliminary relief, or any award of specific\r\nperformance, to which it may be entitled, either against you or against a non-party; provided, however, that no such administrative or\r\njudicial authority shall have the right or power to render a judgment or award (or to enjoin the rendering of an arbitral award) for\r\ndamages that may be due to or from either party under this EULA, which right and power shall be reserved exclusively to an arbitration\r\npanel proceeding in accordance herewith.\r\n\r\n20. No Waiver. No waiver of breach or failure to exercise any option, right, or privilege under the terms of this EULA on any\r\noccasion shall be construed to be a waiver of a subsequent breach or right to exercise any option, right, or privilege.\r\n21. Force Majeure. Dell shall not be responsible for any delay or failure in performance of any part of this EULA to the extent\r\nthat such delay or failure is caused by fire, flood, explosion, war, embargo, government requirement, civil, or military\r\nauthority, act of God, act or omission of carriers, failure of the Internet or other similar causes beyond its control.\r\n22. No Assignment. Except as set forth herein, you may not assign or transfer your interests, rights or obligations under this\r\nEULA by written agreement, merger, consolidation, operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of an\r\nauthorized executive officer of Dell. Any attempt to assign this EULA by you without such prior written consent from Dell\r\nshall be null and void.\r\n23. Entire Agreement. Unless you have entered into another written agreement with respect to the Software which has\r\nbeen signed by you and an authorized representative of Dell and which conflicts with the terms of this EULA, you agree\r\nthat this EULA supersedes all prior written or oral agreements, warranties or representations, including any and all other\r\nclick-wrap, shrink-wrap or similar licenses or agreements, with respect to the Software. No amendment to or\r\nmodification of this EULA, in whole or in part, will be valid or binding unless it is in writing and executed by authorized\r\nrepresentatives of both parties.
