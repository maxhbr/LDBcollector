IETF Standards Process. The term IETF Standards Process has the meaning\r\nassigned to it in RFC 5378. In addition, the IETF Trust interprets the IETF Standards Process to\r\ninclude the archiving of IETF Documents in perpetuity for reference in support of IETF activities\r\nand the implementation of IETF standards and specifications.\r\n\r\nc. Licenses For Use Outside the IETF Standards Process. In addition to the rights\r\ngranted with respect to Code Components described in Section 4 below, the IETF Trust hereby\r\ngrants to each person who wishes to exercise such rights, to the greatest extent that it is permitted\r\nto do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all copyrights and\r\nrights of authors:\r\n\r\ni. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF\r\nDocuments in full and without modification,\r\n\r\nii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents into languages other\r\nthan English, and to copy, publish, display and distribute such translated IETF Contributions and\r\nIETF Documents in full and without modification,\r\n\r\niii. to copy, publish, display and distribute unmodified portions of IETF\r\nContributions and IETF Documents and translations thereof, provided that:\r\n\r\n(x) each such portion is clearly attributed to IETF and identifies the\r\nRFC or other IETF Document or IETF Contribution from which it is taken,\r\n\r\n(y) all IETF legends, legal notices and indications of authorship\r\ncontained in the original IETF RFC must also be included where any substantial portion of the\r\ntext of an IETF RFC, and in any event where more than one-fifth of such text, is reproduced in a\r\nsingle document or series of related documents.\r\n\r\nd. Licenses that are not Granted. The following licenses are not granted pursuant to\r\nthese Legal Provisions:\r\n\r\ni. any license to modify IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, or portions\r\nthereof (other than to make translations or to extract, use and modify Code Components as\r\npermitted under the licenses granted under Section 4 of these Legal Provisions) in any context\r\noutside the IETF Standards Process, or\r\n\r\nii. any license to publish, display or distribute IETF Contributions or IETF\r\nDocuments, or portions thereof, without the required legends and notices described in these\r\nLegal Provisions.\r\n\r\ne. Requesting Additional Rights.

Such request will be considered by the IETF Trust, which will\r\nmake a decision regarding the request in its sole discretion and inform the requester of its\r\ndisposition. In addition, individual Contributors may be contacted regarding licenses to their\r\nIETF Contributions. The IETF Trust does not limit the ability of IETF Contributors to license\r\ntheir Contributions, so long as those licenses do not affect the rights granted to the IETF Trust\r\nunder RFC 5378.\r\n\r\n4. License to Code Components.\r\n\r\na. Definition. IETF Contributions and IETF Documents often include components\r\nintended to be directly processed by a computer (“Code Components”). A list of common Code\r\nComponents can be found at http:\/\/trustee.ietf.org\/policyandprocedures.html .\r\n\r\nb. Identification. Text in IETF Contributions and IETF Documents of the types\r\nidentified in Section 4.a above shall constitute “Code Components”. In addition, any text found\r\nbetween the markers <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS>, or otherwise clearly labeled as a\r\nCode Component, shall be considered a “Code Component”.\r\n\r\nc. License. In addition to the licenses granted under Section 3, Code Components\r\nare also licensed to each person who wishes to receive such a license on the terms of the \"BSD\r\nLicense\", as described below. If a licensee elects to apply the BSD License to a Code\r\nComponent, then the additional licenses and restrictions set forth in Section 3 and elsewhere in\r\nthese Legal Provisions shall not apply thereto.\r\n\r\nBSD License:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) [insert year] IETF Trust and the persons identified as the document authors.

Those who use Code Components under the license granted under\r\nSection 4.c above are requested to attribute each such Code Component to IETF and identify the\r\nRFC or other IETF Document or IETF Contribution from which it is taken. Such attribution\r\nmay be placed in the code itself (e.g., “This code was derived from IETF RFC [insert RFC\r\nnumber].

If a Contributor desires to limit\r\nthe right to make modifications and derivative works of an IETF Contribution, or to limit its\r\npublication, one of the following notices must be included. These notices may not be used with\r\nany standards-track document, nor with most working group documents.\r\n\r\ni. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications, but does wish to\r\nallow publication as an RFC:\r\nThis document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, except to\r\nformat it for publication as an RFC and to translate it into languages other than English.\r\n\r\nii. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications nor to allow\r\npublication as an RFC:\r\nThis document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, and it may not\r\nbe published except as an Internet-Draft.\r\n\r\n7. Terms Applicable to All IETF Documents. The following legal terms apply to all IETF\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\na.

The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any\r\nIntellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation\r\nor use of the technology described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license\r\nunder such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has made any\r\nindependent effort to identify any such rights.\r\n\r\nc. Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and\r\nany assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a\r\ngeneral license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of\r\nthis specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/ipr.\r\n\r\nd. The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any copyrights,\r\npatents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights that may cover technology that may be\r\nrequired to implement any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please\r\naddress the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.\r\n\r\ne. The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or under the\r\nauspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are published by third parties,\r\nincluding those that are translated into other languages, should not be considered to be definitive\r\nversions of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions is that published\r\nby, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of these Legal Provisions that are published by\r\nthird parties, including those that are translated into other languages, should not be considered to\r\nbe definitive versions of these Legal Provisions.\r\n\r\nf. For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards Process\r\nlicenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of the IETF Standards Process to the\r\nIETF Trust pursuant to the provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,\r\nconditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the rights and licenses granted under\r\nRFC 5378, shall have any effect and shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such\r\nContributor, or included with or in such Contribution.\r\n\r\nThe rest:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009 Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>\r\n\r\nThe following terms apply to all files associated with the software unless\r\nexplicitly disclaimed in individual files.\r\n\r\nThe authors hereby grant permission to use, copy, modify, distribute,\r\nand license this software and its documentation for any purpose, provided\r\nthat existing copyright notices are retained in all copies and that this\r\nnotice is included verbatim in any distributions.
