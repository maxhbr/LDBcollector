By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\n14.\tLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\n15.\tsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\n16.\tGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\n17.\tFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\n18.\tusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\n19.\tthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\n20.\tyour programs, too.\r\n21.\t \r\n22.\t  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\n23.\tprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\n24.\thave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\n25.\tthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\n26.\tif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\n27.\tin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n28.\t \r\n29.\t  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n30.\tanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\n31.\tThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\n32.\tdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n33.\t \r\n34.\t  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\n35.\tgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\n36.\tyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\n37.\tsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\n38.\trights.\r\n39.\t \r\n40.\t  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n41.\t(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\n42.\tdistribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n43.\t \r\n44.\t  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\n45.\tthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\n46.\tsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\n47.\twant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\n48.\tthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\n49.\tauthors' reputations.\r\n50.\t \r\n51.\t  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\n52.\tpatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\n53.\tprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\n54.\tprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\n55.\tpatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n56.\t \r\n57.\t  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n58.\tmodification follow.\r\n59.\t\r\n60.\t            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n61.\t   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n62.\t \r\n63.\t  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\n64.\ta notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\n65.\tunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\n66.\trefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\n67.\tmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\n68.\tthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\n69.\teither verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\r\n70.\tlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\n71.\tthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n72.\t \r\n73.\tActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n74.\tcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n75.\trunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\n76.\tis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\n77.\tProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\n78.\tWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n79.\t \r\n80.\t  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\n81.\tsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\n82.\tconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\n83.\tcopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\n84.\tnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\n85.\tand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\n86.\talong with the Program.\r\n87.\t \r\n88.\tYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\n89.\tyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n90.\t \r\n91.\t  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\n92.\tof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\n93.\tdistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n94.\tabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n95.\t \r\n96.\t    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n97.\t    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n98.\t \r\n99.\t    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n100.\t    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n101.\t    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n102.\t    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n103.\t \r\n104.\t    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n105.\t    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n106.\t    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n107.\t    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n108.\t    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n109.\t    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n110.\t    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n111.\t    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n112.\t    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n113.\t    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n114.\t\r\n115.\tThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n116.\tidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\n117.\tand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n118.\tthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n119.\tsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n120.\tdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n121.\ton the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n122.\tthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n123.\tentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n124.\t \r\n125.\tThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n126.\tyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n127.\texercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n128.\tcollective works based on the Program.\r\n129.\t \r\n130.\tIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\n131.\twith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\n132.\ta storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n133.\tthe scope of this License.\r\n134.\t \r\n135.\t  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\n136.\tunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\n137.\tSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n138.\t \r\n139.\t    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n140.\t    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n141.\t    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n142.\t \r\n143.\t    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n144.\t    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n145.\t    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n146.\t    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n147.\t    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n148.\t    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n149.\t \r\n150.\t    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n151.\t    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n152.\t    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n153.\t    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n154.\t    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n155.\t \r\n156.\tThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n157.\tmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\n158.\tcode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\n159.\tassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\n160.\tcontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\n161.\tspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\n162.\tanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\n163.\tform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\n164.\toperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\n165.\titself accompanies the executable.\r\n166.\t \r\n167.\tIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\n168.\taccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\n169.\taccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\n170.\tdistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n171.\tcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n172.\t\r\n173.\t  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\n174.\texcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\n175.\totherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\n176.\tvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\n177.\tHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\n178.\tthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\n179.\tparties remain in full compliance.\r\n180.\t \r\n181.\t  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n182.\tsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n183.\tdistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n184.\tprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n185.\tmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\n186.\tProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n187.\tall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n188.\tthe Program or works based on it.\r\n189.\t \r\n190.\t  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\n191.\tProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n192.\toriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\n193.\tthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n194.\trestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n195.\tYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\n196.\tthis License.\r\n197.\t \r\n198.\t  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n199.\tinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n200.\tconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n201.\totherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n202.\texcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n203.\tdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n204.\tLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n205.\tmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n206.\tlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\n207.\tall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n208.\tthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n209.\trefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n210.\t \r\n211.\tIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\n212.\tany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\n213.\tapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\n214.\tcircumstances.\r\n215.\t \r\n216.\tIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n217.\tpatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n218.\tsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n219.\tintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\n220.\timplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n221.\tgenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n222.\tthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n223.\tsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n224.\tto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n225.\timpose that choice.\r\n226.\t \r\n227.\tThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n228.\tbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n229.\t\r\n230.\t  8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\n231.\tcertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n232.\toriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\n233.\tmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\n234.\tthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\n235.\tcountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\n236.\tthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n237.\t \r\n238.\t  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\n239.\tof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\n240.\tbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\n241.\taddress new problems or concerns.\r\n242.\t \r\n243.\tEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\n244.\tspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\n245.\tlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\n246.\teither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\n247.\tSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\n248.\tthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\n249.\tFoundation.\r\n250.\t \r\n251.\t  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\n252.\tprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\n253.\tto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\n254.\tSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\n255.\tmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\n256.\tof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\n257.\tof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n258.\t \r\n259.\t                NO WARRANTY\r\n260.\t \r\n261.\t  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\n262.\tFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\n263.\tOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\n264.\tPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\n265.\tOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\n266.\tMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\n267.\tTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\n268.\tPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\n269.\tREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n270.\t \r\n271.\t  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\n272.\tWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\n273.\tREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\n274.\tINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\n275.\tOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\n276.\tTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\n277.\tYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\n278.\tPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\n279.\tPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n280.\t \r\n281.\t             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n282.\t\r\n283.\t        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n284.\t \r\n285.\t  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n286.\tpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\n287.\tfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n288.\t \r\n289.\t  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\n290.\tto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\n291.\tconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\n292.\tthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n293.\t \r\n294.\t    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n295.\t    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n296.\t \r\n297.\t    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n298.\t    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n299.\t    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n300.\t    (at your option) any later version.\r\n301.\t \r\n302.\t    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n303.\t    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n304.\t    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
