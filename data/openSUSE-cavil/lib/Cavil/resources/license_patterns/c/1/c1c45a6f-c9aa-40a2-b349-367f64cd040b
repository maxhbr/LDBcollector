We decided that to foster the use of\r\n    cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more\r\n    sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities\r\n    between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.\r\n\r\n    Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be\r\n    licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free\r\n    software projects.
