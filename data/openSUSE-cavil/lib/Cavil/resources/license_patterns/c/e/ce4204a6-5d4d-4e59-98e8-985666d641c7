{"export_restricted":0,"license":"OpenPegasus","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"an open source project.&nbsp; All code that is contributed to this\nproject must be open source and must be made available under the standard\nlicense used by the Pegasus project. Do not use any outside libraries that do\nnot meet this criteria.&nbsp; Further, every reference to outside code make it\nmore complex for others to build and work with the project and introduces\npotential portability problems.&nbsp; At the same time, there may be real\nreasons to use outside code and libraries at times. Thus, for example, the\ninitial project used the ACE_wrappers libraries extensively but with the\nobjective of eventually providing a replacement.&nbsp; That replacement has been\nproduced, partly because ACE was not available on all of the platforms.<\/p>\n\n<p>All code submitted to the Pegasus core source libraries is to be made available\nunder the standard license used by Pegasus.&nbsp; If any code is to be taken\nfrom other open source projects, we expect that the code recognize both the\nrequirements of the Pegasus standard license and the other license (ex. if we\nwere to share code with the Caldera OpenWBEM) project, we would have to show\nboth their license and our licenses.<\/p>\n\n<p>All code input to the Pegasus project must include the license statement.<\/p>\n\n<p>If there is a case of code that we want to use on the Pegasus project but\nthat is licensed outside of the above rules, it can be included only with the\nspecific permission of the Pegasus project management.&nbsp; We will be very\nhesitant to do this since it could mean weakening the whole open source nature\nof the project and would greatly complicate our license arrangements","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"ce4204a6-5d4d-4e59-98e8-985666d641c7"}
