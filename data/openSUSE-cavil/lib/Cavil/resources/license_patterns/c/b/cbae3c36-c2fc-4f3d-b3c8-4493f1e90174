It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
