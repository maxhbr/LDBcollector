The Source Code version of Covered Code may\n    be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of\n    this License released under Section <a href=\"#section-6.1\">6.1<\/a>, and You\n    must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or\n    the recipients' rights hereunder.

You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\n    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is\n    maintained by a third party.<\/p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"section-3.3\">3.3. Description of Modifications.<\/h3>\n\n    <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the\n    date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the\n    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code\n    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial\n    Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable\n    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or\n    ownership of the Covered Code.<\/p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"section-3.4\">3.4.

The notice must be conspicuously\n    included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n    collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered\n    Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or\n    ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the\n    terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does\n    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code\n    version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the\n    Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely\n    clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n    alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\n    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability\n    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\n    such terms You offer.<\/p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"section-3.7\">3.7. Larger Works.<\/h3>\n\n    <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as\n    a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of\n    this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<\/p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"section-4\">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or\n    Regulation.<\/h2>\n\n    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,\n    judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in\n    the <strong class=\"very-strong\">legal<\/strong> file described in Section <a\n    href=\"#section-3.4\">3.4<\/a> and must be included with all distributions of\n    the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n    such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n    skill to be able to understand it.<\/p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"section-5\">5. Application of this License.<\/h2>\n\n    <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\n    the notice in <a href=\"#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A<\/a> and to related Covered\n    Code.<\/p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"section-6\">6.
