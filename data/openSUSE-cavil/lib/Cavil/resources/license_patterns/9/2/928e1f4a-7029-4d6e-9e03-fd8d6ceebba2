In\nthe event that the CPL is found to be illegal or invalid, or if any application\nor clause of the license is subjected to question or abuse, this section is a\ngeneral statement of the desired interpretation.\n\nThis section has no legal standing and the statements made here are strictly\nsubject to the text of the CPL; that is, if this section and the CPL are in\ndisagreement, the text of the CPL takes precedence. In no way does this\nintent grant you any additional rights or impose any additional restrictions.\n\nIf you have questions about licensing, contact the maintainers.\n\nQxt is built and supported by open-source enthusiasts.\n- Please respect the open-source background of the contributors. The code is\n  provided for everyone's use; you may not restrict the rights of anyone to\n  use it.\n      - No individual may claim ownership of any part of the code. It belongs\n        to the community.\n      - You may modify the source code to suit your needs, but these changes\n        must be made free. If you distribute a modified form of Qxt, you must\n        also distribute the entire source code of the modified form.\n      - Digital Rights Management (DRM) puts unfair, unfree restrictions on\n        users and developers. It is the opposite of Free Software. We can't\n        stop you from using it, but please don't use the Qxt name for software\n        restricted by DRM.\n- Please respect the time and effort put into the project by the developers.\n      - If you find Qxt useful, it would be appreciated if you would include\n        text in your application (for instance, in the About dialog) giving\n        acknowledgement to Qxt.\n      - If you make modifications to the source code, you must not call the\n        modified version \"Qxt.\" It's okay to include \"Qxt\" in the name, but\n        anyone who receives the modified version needs to know that it's not\n        the same as the version distributed by the Qxt Foundation.\n- We want everyone to be able to use Qxt without restrictions.\n      - If you distribute Qxt in compiled binary form, please ensure that\n        everyone who receives it can get the source code used to create it.\n      - You are free to use Qxt in closed-source applications as long as you\n        distribute Qxt in an open-source fashion. This does not require you\n        to make your entire application open-source.\n- The Qxt Foundation is a non-profit, non-political organization.\n      - Please don't use the Qxt name in any political or semi-political\n        propaganda or publication. We don't like it.\n- Qxt is distributed \"as-is,\" with no warranty.\n      - If it makes your program crash, your computer blow up, or tiny demons","risk":1,"spdx":"CPL-1.0 OR LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"928e1f4a-7029-4d6e-9e03-fd8d6ceebba2"}
