COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<\/B><\/FONT> \n<P><FONT size=2>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain \nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. \nWhile this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, \nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should \ndo so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other \nContributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial \nproduct offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \ndefend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against \nany losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, \nlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \nIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a \ncommercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any \nclaims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property \ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly \nnotify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the \nCommercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor \nin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified \nContributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<\/FONT> \n<P><FONT size=2><\/FONT>\n<P><FONT size=2>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a \ncommercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial \nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or \noffers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties \nare such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court \nrequires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial \nContributor must pay those damages.<\/FONT> \n<P><FONT size=2><\/FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><\/FONT>\n<P><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><\/FONT><FONT size=2><B>5.
