License grant.\r\n .\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n .\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n .\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n .\r\n       2.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n .\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n .\r\n       5.

No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n .\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n .\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n .\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and\/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n .\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n .\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n .\r\n Section 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n .\r\n Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\n following conditions.\r\n .\r\n  a.
