It also\r\ncounts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,\r\nversion 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away\r\nyour freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU\r\nGeneral Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\r\nfreedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\r\nsoftware is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to\r\nsome specially designated software packages--typically\r\nlibraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors\r\nwho decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you\r\nfirst think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any\r\nparticular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom\r\nof use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed\r\nto make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies\r\nof free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that\r\nyou receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you\r\ncan change the software and use pieces of it in new free\r\nprograms; and that you are informed that you can do these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that\r\nforbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to\r\nsurrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain\r\nresponsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library\r\nor if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\r\nthat we gave you. You must make sure that they, too,\r\nreceive or can get the source code. If you link other code\r\nwith the library, you must provide complete object files to the\r\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after\r\nmaking changes to the library and recompiling it. And you\r\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we\r\ncopyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which\r\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear\r\nthat there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the\r\nlibrary is modified by someone else and passed on, the\r\nrecipients should know that what they have is not the original\r\nversion, so that the original author's reputation will not be\r\naffected by problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the\r\nexistence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a\r\ncompany cannot effectively restrict the users of a free\r\nprogram by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent\r\nholder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained\r\nfor a version of the library must be consistent with the full\r\nfreedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by\r\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the\r\nGNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain\r\ndesignated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License. We use this license for certain\r\nlibraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or\r\nusing a shared library, the combination of the two is legally\r\nspeaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.\r\nThe ordinary General Public License therefore permits such\r\nlinking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of\r\nfreedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more\r\nlax criteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License\r\nbecause it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the\r\nordinary General Public License. It also provides other free\r\nsoftware developers Less of an advantage over competing\r\nnon-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we\r\nuse the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.\r\nHowever, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\nspecial circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special\r\nneed to encourage the widest possible use of a certain\r\nlibrary, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve\r\nthis, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A\r\nmore frequent case is that a free library does the same job\r\nas widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\r\nto gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we\r\nuse the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in\r\nnon-free programs enables a greater number of people to use\r\na large body of free software. For example, permission to\r\nuse the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\r\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\r\nwell as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less\r\nprotective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user\r\nof a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom\r\nand the wherewithal to run that program using a modified\r\nversion of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\r\nand modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\r\nbetween a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses\r\nthe library\". The former contains code derived from the\r\nlibrary, whereas the latter must be combined with the library\r\nin order to run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION\r\nAND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or\r\nother program which contains a notice placed by the\r\ncopyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public\r\nLicense (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is\r\naddressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or\r\ndata prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\r\napplication programs (which use some of those functions\r\nand data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or\r\nwork which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work\r\nbased on the Library\" means either the Library or any\r\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\r\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\r\nmodifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another\r\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\r\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the\r\nwork for making modifications to it. For a library, complete\r\nsource code means all the source code for all modules it\r\ncontains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus\r\nthe scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification\r\nare not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\r\nThe act of running a program using the Library is not\r\nrestricted, and output from such a program is covered only if\r\nits contents constitute a work based on the Library\r\n(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Library does and\r\nwhat the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the\r\nLibrary's complete source code as you receive it, in any\r\nmedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\r\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer\r\nto this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\ndistribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\r\ncopy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\r\nexchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any\r\nportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and\r\ncopy and distribute such modifications or work under the\r\nterms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\r\nthese conditions:\r\n\r\n     a) The modified work must itself be a software\r\n     library.\r\n     b) You must cause the files modified to carry\r\n     prominent notices stating that you changed the\r\n     files and the date of any change.\r\n     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be\r\n     licensed at no charge to all third parties under\r\n     the terms of this License.\r\n     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a\r\n     function or a table of data to be supplied by an\r\n     application program that uses the facility, other\r\n     than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n     is invoked, then you must make a good faith\r\n     effort to ensure that, in the event an application\r\n     does not supply such function or table, the\r\n     facility still operates, and performs whatever\r\n     part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n     (For example, a function in a library to\r\n     compute square roots has a purpose that is\r\n     entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n     application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires\r\n     that any application-supplied function or table\r\n     used by this function must be optional: if the\r\n     application does not supply it, the square root\r\n     function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\n     These requirements apply to the modified work\r\n     as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work\r\n     are not derived from the Library, and can be\r\n     reasonably considered independent and\r\n     separate works in themselves, then this\r\n     License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n     sections when you distribute them as separate\r\n     works. But when you distribute the same\r\n     sections as part of a whole which is a work\r\n     based on the Library, the distribution of the\r\n     whole must be on the terms of this License,\r\n     whose permissions for other licensees extend\r\n     to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\r\n     part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim\r\n     rights or contest your rights to work written\r\n     entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\r\n     the right to control the distribution of derivative\r\n     or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work\r\n     not based on the Library with the Library (or\r\n     with a work based on the Library) on a volume\r\n     of a storage or distribution medium does not\r\n     bring the other work under the scope of this\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU\r\nGeneral Public License instead of this License to a given\r\ncopy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary\r\nGNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this\r\nLicense. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\r\nGNU General Public License has appeared, then you can\r\nspecify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any\r\nother change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible\r\nfor that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License\r\napplies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made\r\nfrom that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code\r\nof the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable\r\nform under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that\r\nyou accompany it with the complete corresponding\r\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed\r\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to\r\ncopy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place\r\nsatisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\r\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\nalong with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being\r\ncompiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\r\nLibrary\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of\r\nthe Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the\r\nLibrary creates an executable that is a derivative of the\r\nLibrary (because it contains portions of the Library), rather\r\nthan a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\r\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for\r\ndistribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a\r\nheader file that is part of the Library, the object code for the\r\nwork may be a derivative work of the Library even though the\r\nsource code is not. Whether this is true is especially\r\nsignificant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if\r\nthe work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is\r\nnot precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and\r\nsmall inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the\r\nuse of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it\r\nis legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this\r\nobject code plus portions of the Library will still fall under\r\nSection 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of\r\nSection 6. Any executables containing that work also fall\r\nunder Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with\r\nthe Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also\r\ncombine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the\r\nLibrary to produce a work containing portions of the Library,\r\nand distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided\r\nthat the terms permit modification of the work for the\r\ncustomer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging\r\nsuch modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work\r\nthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use\r\nare covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\r\nLicense. If the work during execution displays copyright\r\nnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library\r\namong them, as well as a reference directing the user to the\r\ncopy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\n     a) Accompany the work with the complete\r\n     corresponding machine-readable source code\r\n     for the Library including whatever changes were\r\n     used in the work (which must be distributed\r\n     under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work\r\n     is an executable linked with the Library, with\r\n     the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n     uses the Library\", as object code and\/or\r\n     source code, so that the user can modify the\r\n     Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n     executable containing the modified Library. (It\r\n     is understood that the user who changes the\r\n     contents of definitions files in the Library will\r\n     not necessarily be able to recompile the\r\n     application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\n     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for\r\n     linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\r\n     is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the\r\n     library already present on the user's computer\r\n     system, rather than copying library functions\r\n     into the executable, and (2) will operate\r\n     properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\n     the user installs one, as long as the modified\r\n     version is interface-compatible with the version\r\n     that the work was made with.\r\n\r\n     c) Accompany the work with a written offer,\r\n     valid for at least three years, to give the same\r\n     user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,\r\n     above, for a charge no more than the cost of\r\n     performing this distribution.\r\n\r\n     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering\r\n     access to copy from a designated place, offer\r\n     equivalent access to copy the above specified\r\n     materials from the same place.\r\n\r\n     e) Verify that the user has already received a\r\n     copy of these materials or that you have\r\n     already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses\r\nthe Library\" must include any data and utility programs\r\nneeded for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the materials to be distributed need not\r\ninclude anything that is normally distributed (in either source\r\nor binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\r\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable\r\nruns, unless that component itself accompanies the\r\nexecutable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction\r\nmeans you cannot use both them and the Library together in\r\nan executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on\r\nthe Library side-by-side in a single library together with other\r\nlibrary facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\r\nsuch a combined library, provided that the separate\r\ndistribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\r\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you\r\ndo these two things:\r\n\r\n     a) Accompany the combined library with a\r\n     copy of the same work based on the Library,\r\n     uncombined with any other library facilities.\r\n     This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n     Sections above.\r\n\r\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined\r\n     library of the fact that part of it is a work based\r\n     on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\n     accompanying uncombined form of the same\r\n     work.\r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\ndistribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\r\nLicense. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\r\nlink with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from\r\nyou under this License will not have their licenses terminated\r\nso long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you\r\nhave not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\r\npermission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative\r\nworks. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\r\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing\r\nthe Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate\r\nyour acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\r\nand conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\r\nLibrary or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work\r\nbased on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a\r\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with\r\nor modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the\r\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\r\npatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\r\npatent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by\r\ncourt order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\r\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\r\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to\r\nsatisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License\r\nand any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\r\nyou may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a\r\npatent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of\r\nthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or\r\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\r\nboth it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\ndistribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\r\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the\r\nsection is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is\r\nintended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\r\nany patents or other property right claims or to contest\r\nvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\r\nof protecting the integrity of the free software distribution\r\nsystem which is implemented by public license practices.\r\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide\r\nrange of software distributed through that system in reliance\r\non consistent application of that system; it is up to the\r\nauthor\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\r\nbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\r\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the\r\nLibrary under this License may add an explicit geographical\r\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\r\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\r\nand\/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License\r\nfrom time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\r\nto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\r\nproblems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary specifies a version number of this License which\r\napplies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of\r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that version or of\r\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\nIf the Library does not specify a license version number, you\r\nmay choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other\r\nfree programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\r\nwith these, write to the author to ask for permission. For\r\nsoftware which is copyrighted by the Free Software\r\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\r\nguided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\r\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\nand reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF\r\nCHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,\r\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE\r\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\r\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\r\nQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH\r\nYOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\r\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\nAND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\r\nABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING\r\nANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\r\nOR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT\r\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\r\nLIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\r\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"962d7c32-ab1b-4131-be6a-a0325381d2a4"}
