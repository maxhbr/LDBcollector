You can mention the font and author in the book's colophon if you wish, but that is not required.\r\n\r\n1.2  Can the fonts be included with Free\/Libre and Open Source Software collections such as GNU\/Linux and BSD distributions?\r\nYes! Fonts licensed under the OFL can be freely included alongside other software under FLOSS (Free\/Libre and Open Source \r\nSoftware) licenses. Since fonts are typically aggregated with, not merged into, existing software, there is little need \r\nto be concerned about incompatibility with existing software licenses. You may also repackage the fonts and the accompanying \r\ncomponents in a .rpm or .deb package and include them in distribution CD\/DVDs and online repositories. (Also see section \r\n5.9 about rebuilding from source.)\r\n\r\n1.3  I want to distribute the fonts with my program. Does this mean my program also has to be Free\/Libre and Open Source \r\nSoftware?\r\nNo. Only the portions based on the Font Software are required to be released under the OFL. The intent of the license \r\nis to allow aggregation or bundling with software under restricted licensing as well.\r\n\r\n1.4  Can I sell a software package that includes these fonts?\r\nYes, you can do this with both the Original Version and a Modified Version of the fonts. Examples of bundling made possible \r\nby the OFL would include: word processors, design and publishing applications, training and educational software, games \r\nand entertainment software, mobile device applications, etc.\r\n\r\n1.5  Can I include the fonts on a CD of freeware or commercial fonts?\r\nYes, as long some other font or software is also on the disk, so the OFL font is not sold by itself.\r\n\r\n1.6  Why won't the OFL let me sell the fonts alone?\r\nThe intent is to keep people from making money by simply redistributing the fonts. The only people who ought to profit \r\ndirectly from the fonts should be the original authors, and those authors have kindly given up potential direct income \r\nto distribute their fonts under the OFL. Please honour and respect their contribution!\r\n\r\n1.7  What about sharing OFL fonts with friends on a CD, DVD or USB stick?\r\nYou are very welcome to share open fonts with friends, family and colleagues through removable media. Just remember \r\nto include the full font package, including any copyright notices and licensing information as available in OFL.txt. \r\nIn the case where you sell the font, it has to come bundled with software.\r\n\r\n1.8  Can I host the fonts on a web site for others to use?\r\nYes, as long as you make the full font package available. In most cases it may be best to point users to the main site \r\nthat distributes the Original Version so they always get the most recent stable and complete version. See also discussion \r\nof webfonts in Section 2.\r\n\r\n1.9  Can I host the fonts on a server for use over our internal network?\r\nYes. If the fonts are transferred from the server to the client computer by means that allow them to be used even if \r\nthe computer is no longer attached to the network, the full package (copyright notices, licensing information, etc.) \r\nshould be included.\r\n\r\n1.10  Does the full OFL license text always need to accompany the font?\r\nThe only situation in which an OFL font can be distributed without the text of the OFL (either in a separate file or \r\nin font metadata), is when a font is embedded in a document or bundled within a program. In the case of metadata included \r\nwithin a font, it is legally sufficient to include only a link to the text of the OFL on http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL, \r\nbut we strongly recommend against this. Most modern font formats include metadata fields that will accept the full OFL \r\ntext, and full inclusion increases the likelihood that users will understand and properly apply the license.\r\n\r\n1.11  What do you mean by 'embedding'? How does that differ from other means of distribution?\r\nBy 'embedding' we mean inclusion of the font in a document or file in a way that makes extraction (and redistribution) \r\ndifficult or clearly discouraged. In many cases the names of embedded fonts might also not be obvious to those reading \r\nthe document, the font data format might be altered, and only a subset of the font - only the glyphs required for the \r\ntext - might be included. Any other means of delivering a font to another person is considered 'distribution', and needs \r\nto be accompanied by any copyright notices and licensing information available in OFL.txt.\r\n\r\n1.12  So can I embed OFL fonts in my document?\r\nYes, either in full or a subset. The restrictions regarding font modification and redistribution do not apply, as the \r\nfont is not intended for use outside the document.\r\n\r\n1.13  Does embedding alter the license of the document itself?\r\nNo. Referencing or embedding an OFL font in any document does not change the license of the document itself. The requirement \r\nfor fonts to remain under the OFL does not apply to any document created using the fonts and their derivatives. Similarly, \r\ncreating any kind of graphic using a font under OFL does not make the resulting artwork subject to the OFL.\r\n\r\n1.14  If OFL fonts are extracted from a document in which they are embedded (such as a PDF file), what can be done with \r\nthem? Is this a risk to author(s)?\r\nThe few utilities that can extract fonts embedded in a PDF will typically output limited amounts of outlines - not a \r\ncomplete font. To create a working font from this method is much more difficult and time consuming than finding the \r\nsource of the original OFL font. So there is little chance that an OFL font would be extracted and redistributed inappropriately \r\nthrough this method. Even so, copyright laws address any misrepresentation of authorship. All Font Software released \r\nunder the OFL and marked as such by the author(s) is intended to remain under this license regardless of the distribution \r\nmethod, and cannot be redistributed under any other license. We strongly discourage any font extraction - we recommend \r\ndirectly using the font sources instead - but if you extract font outlines from a document, please be considerate: use \r\nyour common sense and respect the work of the author(s) and the licensing model.\r\n\r\n1.15  What about distributing fonts with a document? Within a compressed folder structure? Is it distribution, bundling \r\nor embedding?\r\nCertain document formats may allow the inclusion of an unmodified font within their file structure which consists of \r\na compressed folder containing the various resources forming the document (such as pictures and thumbnails). Including \r\nfonts within such a structure is understood as being different from embedding but rather similar to bundling (or mere \r\naggregation) which the license explicitly allows. In this case the font is conveyed unchanged whereas embedding a font \r\nusually transforms it from the original format. The OFL does not allow anyone to extract the font from such a structure \r\nto then redistribute it under another license. The explicit permission to redistribute and embed does not cancel the \r\nrequirement for the Font Software to remain under the license chosen by its author(s).\r\n\r\n1.16  What about ebooks shipping with open fonts?\r\nThe requirements differ depending on whether the fonts are linked, embedded or distributed (bundled or aggregated). \r\nSome ebook formats use web technologies to do font linking via @font-face, others are designed for font embedding, some \r\nuse fonts distributed with the document or reading software, and a few rely solely on the fonts already present on the \r\ntarget system. The license requirements depend on the type of inclusion as discussed in 1.15.\r\n\r\n1.17  Can Font Software released under the OFL be subject to URL-based access restrictions methods or DRM (Digital Rights \r\nManagement) mechanisms?\r\nYes, but these issues are out-of-scope for the OFL. The license itself neither encourages their use nor prohibits them \r\nsince such mechanisms are not implemented in the components of the Font Software but through external software. Such \r\nrestrictions are put in place for many different purposes corresponding to various usage scenarios. One common example \r\nis to limit potentially dangerous cross-site scripting attacks. However, in the spirit of libre\/open fonts and unrestricted \r\nwriting systems, we strongly encourage open sharing and reuse of OFL fonts, and the establishment of an environment \r\nwhere such restrictions are unnecessary. Note that whether you wish to use such mechanisms or you prefer not to, you \r\nmust still abide by the rules set forth by the OFL when using fonts released by their authors under this license. Derivative \r\nfonts must be licensed under the OFL, even if they are part of a service for which you charge fees and\/or for which \r\naccess to source code is restricted. You may not sell the fonts on their own - they must be part of a larger software \r\npackage, bundle or subscription plan. For example, even if the OFL font is distributed in a software package or via \r\nan online service using a DRM mechanism, the user would still have the right to extract that font, use, study, modify \r\nand redistribute it under the OFL.\r\n\r\n1.18  I've come across a font released under the OFL. How can I easily get more information about the Original Version? \r\nHow can I know where it stands compared to the Original Version or other Modified Versions?\r\nConsult the copyright statement(s) in the license for ways to contact the original authors. Consult the FONTLOG for \r\ninformation on how the font differs from the Original Version, and get in touch with the various contributors via the \r\ninformation in the acknowledgement section. Please consider using the Original Versions of the fonts whenever possible.\r\n\r\n1.19  What do you mean in condition 4? Can you provide examples of abusive promotion \/ endorsement \/ advertisement vs. \r\nnormal acknowledgement?\r\nThe intent is that the goodwill and reputation of the author(s) should not be used in a way that makes it sound like \r\nthe original author(s) endorse or approve of a specific Modified Version or software bundle. For example, it would not \r\nbe right to advertise a word processor by naming the author(s) in a listing of software features, or to promote a Modified \r\nVersion on a web site by saying \"designed by ...\". However, it would be appropriate to acknowledge the author(s) if \r\nyour software package has a list of people who deserve thanks. We realize that this can seem to be a grey area, but \r\nthe standard used to judge an acknowledgement is that if the acknowledgement benefits the author(s) it is allowed, but \r\nif it primarily benefits other parties, or could reflect poorly on the author(s), then it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n2  USING OFL FONTS FOR WEBPAGES AND ONLINE WEBFONT SERVICES\r\n\r\n2.1  Can I make webpages using these fonts?\r\nYes! Go ahead! Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is recommended. Your three best options: \r\n- referring directly in your stylesheet to open fonts which may be available on the user's system\r\n- providing links to download the full package of the font - either from your own website or from elsewhere - so users \r\ncan install it themselves\r\n- using @font-face to distribute the font directly to browsers. This is recommended and explicitly allowed by the licensing \r\nmodel because it is distribution. The font file itself is distributed with other components of the webpage. It is not \r\nembedded in the webpage but referenced through a web address which will cause the browser to retrieve and use the corresponding \r\nfont to render the webpage (see 1.11 and 1.15 for details related to embedding fonts into documents). As you take advantage \r\nof the @font-face cross-platform standard, be aware that webfonts are often tuned for a web environment and not intended \r\nfor installation and use outside a browser. The reasons in favour of using webfonts are to allow design of dynamic text \r\nelements instead of static graphics, to make it easier for content to be localized and translated, indexed and searched, \r\nand all this with cross-platform open standards without depending on restricted extensions or plugins. You should check \r\nthe CSS cascade (the order in which fonts are being called or delivered to your users) when testing.\r\n\r\n2.2  Can I make and use WOFF (Web Open Font Format) versions of OFL fonts?\r\nYes, but you need to be careful. A change in font format normally is considered modification, and Reserved Font Names \r\n(RFNs) cannot be used. Because of the design of the WOFF format, however, it is possible to create a WOFF version that \r\nis not considered modification, and so would not require a name change. You are allowed to create, use and distribute \r\na WOFF version of an OFL font without changing the font name, but only if:\r\n\r\n- the original font data remains unchanged except for WOFF compression, and\r\n- WOFF-specific metadata is either omitted altogether or present and includes, unaltered, the contents of all equivalent \r\nmetadata in the original font.\r\n\r\nIf the original font data or metadata is changed, or the WOFF-specific metadata is incomplete, the font must be considered \r\na Modified Version, the OFL restrictions would apply and the name of the font must be changed: any RFNs cannot be used \r\nand copyright notices and licensing information must be included and cannot be deleted or modified. You must come up \r\nwith a unique name - we recommend one corresponding to your domain or your particular web application. Be aware that \r\nonly the original author(s) can use RFNs. This is to prevent collisions between a derivative tuned to your audience \r\nand the original upstream version and so to reduce confusion.\r\n\r\nPlease note that most WOFF conversion tools and online services do not meet the two requirements listed above, and so \r\ntheir output must be considered a Modified Version. So be very careful and check to be sure that the tool or service \r\nyou're using is compressing unchanged data and completely and accurately reflecting the original font metadata.\r\n\r\n2.3  What about other webfont formats such as EOT\/EOTLite\/CWT\/etc.?\r\nIn most cases these formats alter the original font data more than WOFF, and do not completely support appropriate metadata, \r\nso their use must be considered modification and RFNs may not be used.\r\n\r\n2.4  Can I make OFL fonts available through webfont online services?\r\nYes, you are welcome to include OFL fonts in online webfont services as long as you properly meet all the conditions \r\nof the license. The origin and open status of the font should be clear among the other fonts you are hosting. Authorship, \r\ncopyright notices and license information must be sufficiently visible to your users or subscribers so they know where \r\nthe font comes from and the rights granted by the author(s). Make sure the font file contains the needed copyright notice(s) \r\nand licensing information in its metadata. Please double-check the accuracy of every field to prevent contradictory \r\ninformation. Other font formats, including EOT\/EOTLite\/CWT and superior alternatives like WOFF, already provide fields \r\nfor this information. Remember that if you modify the font within your library or convert it to another format for any \r\nreason the OFL restrictions apply and you need to change the names accordingly. Please respect the author's wishes as \r\nexpressed in the OFL and do not misrepresent original designers and their work. Don't lump quality open fonts together \r\nwith dubious freeware or public domain fonts. Consider how you can best work with the original designers and foundries, \r\nsupport their efforts and generate goodwill that will benefit your service. (See 1.17 for details related to URL-based \r\naccess restrictions methods or DRM mechanisms).\r\n\r\n2.5  Can I make and publish CMS themes or templates that use OFL fonts?  Can I include the fonts themselves in the themes \r\nor templates? Can I sell the whole package?\r\nYes, you are very welcome to integrate open fonts into themes and templates for your preferred CMS and make them more \r\nwidely available. Be aware that you can only sell the fonts and your CMS add-on as part of a software bundle. (See 1.4 \r\nfor details and examples about selling bundles). \r\n\r\n2.6  Some webfont formats and services provide ways of \"optimising\" the font for a particular website or web application;\r\n is that allowed? \r\nYes, it is permitted, but remember that these optimised versions are Modified Versions and so must follow OFL requirements \r\nlike appropriate renaming. Also you need to bear in mind the other important parameters beyond compression, speed and \r\nresponsiveness: you need to consider the audience of your particular website or web application, as choosing some optimisation \r\nparameters may turn out to be less than ideal for them. Subsetting by removing certain glyphs or features may seriously \r\nlimit functionality of the font in various languages used by your users. It may also introduce degradation of quality \r\nin the rendering or specific bugs on the various platforms compared to the original font. In other words, remember that \r\none person's optimised font may be another person's missing feature. Various advanced typographic features are also \r\navailable through CSS and may provide the desired effects without the need to modify the font.\r\n\r\n\r\n3  MODIFYING OFL-LICENSED FONTS\r\n\r\n3.1  Can I change the fonts? Are there any limitations to what things I can and cannot change?\r\nYou are allowed to change anything, as long as such changes do not violate the terms of the license. In other words, \r\nyou are not allowed to remove the copyright statement(s) from the font, but you could put additional information into \r\nit that covers your contribution.\r\n\r\n3.2  I have a font that needs a few extra glyphs - can I take them from an OFL licensed font and copy them into mine?\r\nYes, but if you distribute that font to others it must be under the OFL, and include the information mentioned in condition \r\n2 of the license.\r\n\r\n3.3  Can I charge people for my additional work? In other words, if I add a bunch of special glyphs and\/or OpenType\/Graphite \r\ncode, can I sell the enhanced font?\r\nNot by itself. Derivative fonts must be released under the OFL and cannot be sold by themselves. It is permitted, however, \r\nto include them in a larger software package (such as text editors, office suites or operating systems), even if the \r\nlarger package is sold. In that case, you are strongly encouraged, but not required, to also make that derived font \r\neasily and freely available outside of the larger package.\r\n\r\n3.4  Can I pay someone to enhance the fonts for my use and distribution?\r\nYes. This is a good way to fund the further development of the fonts. Keep in mind, however, that if the font is distributed \r\nto others it must be under the OFL. You won't be able to recover your investment by exclusively selling the font, but \r\nyou will be making a valuable contribution to the community. Please remember how you have benefited from the contributions \r\nof others.\r\n\r\n3.5  I need to make substantial revisions to the font to make it work with my program. It will be a lot of work, and \r\na big investment, and I want to be sure that it can only be distributed with my program. Can I restrict its use?\r\nNo. If you redistribute a Modified Version of the font it must be under the OFL. You may not restrict it in any way \r\nbeyond what the OFL permits and requires. This is intended to ensure that all released improvements to the fonts become \r\navailable to everyone. But you will likely get an edge over competitors by being the first to distribute a bundle with \r\nthe enhancements. Again, please remember how you have benefited from the contributions of others.\r\n\r\n3.6  Do I have to make any derivative fonts (including extended source files, build scripts, documentation, etc.) publicly \r\navailable?\r\nNo, but please consider sharing your improvements with others. You may find that you receive in return more than what \r\nyou gave.\r\n\r\n3.7  If a trademark is claimed in the OFL font, does that trademark need to remain in modified fonts?\r\nYes, any trademark notices must remain in any derivative fonts to respect trademark laws, but you may add any additional \r\ntrademarks you claim, officially registered or not. For example if an OFL font called \"Foo\" contains a notice that \r\n\"Foo is a trademark of Acme\", then if you rename the font to \"Bar\" when creating a Modified Version, the new trademark \r\nnotice could say \"Foo is a trademark of Acme Inc. - Bar is a trademark of Roadrunner Technologies Ltd.\". Trademarks \r\nwork alongside the OFL and are not subject to the terms of the licensing agreement. Please refer to the appropriate \r\ntrademark laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n4  LICENSING YOUR ORIGINAL FONTS UNDER THE OFL\r\n\r\n4.1  Can I use the SIL OFL for my own fonts?\r\nYes! We heartily encourage everyone to use the OFL to distribute their own original fonts. It is a carefully constructed \r\nlicense that allows great freedom along with enough artistic integrity protection for the work of the authors as well \r\nas clear rules for other contributors and those who redistribute the fonts. The licensing model is used successfully \r\nby various organisations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, to release fonts of varying levels of scope and complexity.\r\n\r\n4.2  What do I have to do to apply the OFL to my font?\r\nIf you want to release your fonts under the OFL, we recommend you do the following:\r\n\r\n4.2.1  Put your copyright and Reserved Font Names information at the beginning of the main OFL.txt file in place of \r\nthe dedicated placeholders. Include this file in your release package.\r\n\r\n4.2.2  Put your copyright and the OFL text with Reserved Font Names into your font files (the copyright and license \r\nfields). A link to the OFL text on the OFL web site is an acceptable (but not recommended) alternative. Also add this \r\ninformation to any other components (build scripts, glyph databases, documentation, test files, etc). Depending on the \r\nformat of your fonts and sources, you can use template human-readable headers or machine-readable metadata.\r\n\r\n4.2.3  Write an initial FONTLOG.txt for your font and include it in the release package.\r\n\r\n4.2.4  Include the relevant practical documentation on the license by including the OFL-FAQ.txt in your package.\r\n\r\n4.3  Will you make my font OFL for me?\r\nWe won't do the work for you. We can, however, try to answer your questions, unfortunately we do not have the resources \r\nto review and check your font packages for correct use of the OFL.\r\n\r\n4.4  Will you distribute my OFL font for me?\r\nNo, although if the font is of sufficient quality and general interest we may include a link to it on our partial list \r\nof OFL fonts on the OFL web site. You may wish to consider other open font catalogs or hosting services, such as the \r\nUnifont Font Guide (http:\/\/unifont.org\/fontguide), The League of Movable Type (http:\/\/theleagueofmovabletype.com), Kernest \r\n(http:\/\/kernest.com\/) or the Open Font Library (http:\/\/openfontlibrary.org\/), which despite the name has no direct relationship \r\nto the OFL or SIL. We do not endorse any particular catalog or hosting service - it is your responsibility to determine \r\nif the service is right for you.\r\n\r\n4.5  Why should I use the OFL for my fonts?\r\n- to meet needs for fonts that can be modified to support minority languages\r\n- to provide a legal and clear way for people to respect your work but still use it (and reduce piracy)\r\n- to involve others in your font project\r\n- to enable your fonts to be expanded with new weights and improved writing system\/language support\r\n- to allow more technical font developers to add features to your design (such as OpenType and Graphite support)\r\n- to renew the life of an old font lying on your hard drive with no business model\r\n- to allow your font to be included in Libre Software operating systems like Ubuntu\r\n- to give your font world status and wide, unrestricted distribution\r\n- to educate students about quality typeface and font design\r\n- to expand your test base and get more useful feedback \r\n- to extend your reach to new markets when users see your metadata and go to your website\r\n- to get your font more easily into one of the webfont online services\r\n- to attract attention for your commercial fonts\r\n- to make money through webfont services\r\n- to make money by bundling fonts with applications\r\n- to make money adjusting and extending existing open fonts\r\n- to get a better chance that foundations\/NGOs\/charities\/companies who commission fonts will pick you \r\n- to be part of a sharing design and development community \r\n- to give back and contribute to a growing body of font sources\r\n\r\n\r\n5  CHOOSING RESERVED FONT NAMES\r\n\r\n5.1  What are Reserved Font Names?\r\nThese are font names, or portions of font names, that the author has chosen to reserve for use only with the Original \r\nVersion of the font, or for Modified Version(s) created by the original author.\r\n\r\n5.2  Why can't I use the Reserved Font Names in my derivative font names? I'd like people to know where the design came \r\nfrom.\r\nThe best way to acknowledge the source of the design is to thank the original authors and any other contributors in \r\nthe files that are distributed with your revised font (although no acknowledgement is required). The FONTLOG is a natural \r\nplace to do this. Reserved Font Names ensure that the only fonts that have the original names are the unmodified Original \r\nVersions. This allows designers to maintain artistic integrity while allowing collaboration to happen. It eliminates \r\npotential confusion and name conflicts. When choosing a name, be creative and avoid names that reuse almost all the \r\nsame letters in the same order or sound like the original. It will help everyone if Original Versions and Modified Versions \r\ncan easily be distinguished from one another and from other derivatives. Any substitution and matching mechanism is \r\noutside the scope of the license.\r\n\r\n5.3  What do you mean by \"primary name as presented to the user\"? Are you referring to the font menu name?\r\nYes, this applies to the font menu name and other mechanisms that specify a font in a document. It would be fine, however, \r\nto keep a text reference to the original fonts in the description field, in your modified source file or in documentation \r\nprovided alongside your derivative as long as no one could be confused that your modified source is the original. But \r\nyou cannot use the Reserved Font Names in any way to identify the font to the user (unless the Copyright Holder(s) allow(s) \r\nit through a separate agreement). Users who install derivatives (Modified Versions) on their systems should not see \r\nany of the original Reserved Font Names in their font menus, for example. Again, this is to ensure that users are not \r\nconfused and do not mistake one font for another and so expect features only another derivative or the Original Version \r\ncan actually offer. \r\n\r\n5.4  Am I not allowed to use any part of the Reserved Font Names?\r\nYou may not use individual words from the Reserved Font Names, but you would be allowed to use parts of words, as long \r\nas you do not use any word from the Reserved Font Names entirely. We do not recommend using parts of words because of \r\npotential confusion, but it is allowed. For example, if \"Foobar\" was a Reserved Font Name, you would be allowed to use \r\n\"Foo\" or \"bar\", although we would not recommend it. Such an unfortunate choice would confuse the users of your fonts \r\nas well as make it harder for other designers to contribute.\r\n\r\n5.5  So what should I, as an author, identify as Reserved Font Names?\r\nOriginal authors are encouraged to name their fonts using clear, distinct names, and only declare the unique parts of \r\nthe name as Reserved Font Names. For example, the author of a font called \"Foobar Sans\" would declare \"Foobar\" as a \r\nReserved Font Name, but not \"Sans\", as that is a common typographical term, and may be a useful word to use in a derivative \r\nfont name. Reserved Font Names should also be single words. A font called \"Flowing River\" should have Reserved Font \r\nNames \"Flowing\" and \"River\", not \"Flowing River\". You also need to be very careful about reserving font names which \r\nare already linked to trademarks (whether registered or not) which you do not own.\r\n\r\n5.6  Do I, as an author, have to identify any Reserved Font Names?\r\nNo, but we strongly encourage you to do so. This is to avoid confusion between your work and Modified Versions.\r\n\r\n5.7  Are any names (such as the main font name) reserved by default?\r\nNo. That is a change to the license as of version 1.1. If you want any names to be Reserved Font Names, they must be \r\nspecified after the copyright statement(s).\r\n\r\n5.8  Is there any situation in which I can use Reserved Font Names for a Modified Version?\r\nThe Copyright Holder(s) can give certain trusted parties the right to use any of the Reserved Font Names through separate \r\nwritten agreements. For example, even if \"Foobar\" is a RFN, you could write up an agreement to give company \"XYZ\" the \r\nright to distribute a modified version with a name that includes \"Foobar\". This allows for freedom without confusion.\r\n\r\n5.9  Do font rebuilds require a name change? Do I have to change the name of the font when my packaging workflow includes \r\na full rebuild from source?\r\nYes, all rebuilds which change the font data and the smart code are Modified Versions and the requirements of the OFL \r\napply: you need to respect what the Author(s) have chosen in terms of Reserved Font Names. However if a package (or \r\ninstaller) is simply a wrapper or a compressed structure around the final font - leaving them intact on the inside - \r\nthen no name change is required. Please get in touch with the author(s) and copyright holder(s) to inquire about the \r\npresence of font sources beyond the final font file(s) and the recommended build path. That build path may very well \r\nbe non-trivial and hard to reproduce accurately by the maintainer. If a full font build path is made available by the \r\nupstream author(s) please be aware that any regressions and changes you may introduce when doing a rebuild for packaging \r\npurposes is your responsibility as a package maintainer since you are effectively creating a separate branch. You should \r\nmake it very clear to your users that your rebuilt version is not the canonical one from upstream.\r\n\r\n5.10  Can I add other Reserved Font Names when making a derivative font?\r\nYes. List your additional Reserved Font Names after your additional copyright statement, as indicated with example placeholders \r\nat the top of the OFL.txt file. Be sure you do not remove any exiting RFNs but only add your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n6  ABOUT THE FONTLOG\r\n\r\n6.1  What is this FONTLOG thing exactly?\r\nIt has three purposes: 1) to provide basic information on the font to users and other developers, 2) to document changes \r\nthat have been made to the font or accompanying files, either by the original authors or others, and 3) to provide a \r\nplace to acknowledge authors and other contributors. Please use it!\r\n\r\n6.2  Is the FONTLOG required?\r\nIt is not a requirement of the license, but we strongly recommend you have one.\r\n\r\n6.3  Am I required to update the FONTLOG when making Modified Versions?\r\nNo, but users, designers and other developers might get very frustrated with you if you don't. People need to know how \r\nderivative fonts differ from the original, and how to take advantage of the changes, or build on them. There are utilities \r\nthat can help create and maintain a FONTLOG, such as the FONTLOG support in FontForge.\r\n\r\n6.4  What should the FONTLOG look like?\r\nIt is typically a separate text file (FONTLOG.txt), but can take other formats. It commonly includes these four sections:\r\n\r\n- brief header describing the FONTLOG itself and name of the font family\r\n- Basic Font Information - description of the font family, purpose and breadth\r\n- ChangeLog - chronological listing of changes\r\n- Acknowledgements - list of authors and contributors with contact information\r\n\r\nIt could also include other sections, such as: where to find documentation, how to make contributions, information on \r\ncontributing organizations, source code details, and a short design guide. See Appendix A for an example FONTLOG.\r\n\r\n\r\n7  MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO OFL PROJECTS\r\n\r\n7.1  Can I contribute work to OFL projects?\r\nIn many cases, yes. It is common for OFL fonts to be developed by a team of people who welcome contributions from the \r\nwider community. Contact the original authors for specific information on how to participate in their projects.\r\n\r\n7.2  Why should I contribute my changes back to the original authors?\r\nIt would benefit many people if you contributed back in response to what you've received. Your contributions and improvements \r\nto the fonts and other components could be a tremendous help and would encourage others to contribute as well and 'give \r\nback'. You will then benefit from other people's contributions as well. Sometimes maintaining your own separate version \r\ntakes more effort than merging back with the original. Be aware that any contributions, however, must be either your \r\nown original creation or work that you own, and you may be asked to affirm that clearly when you contribute.\r\n\r\n7.3  I've made some very nice improvements to the font. Will you consider adopting them and putting them into future \r\nOriginal Versions?\r\nMost authors would be very happy to receive such contributions. Keep in mind that it is unlikely that they would want \r\nto incorporate major changes that would require additional work on their end. Any contributions would likely need to \r\nbe made for all the fonts in a family and match the overall design and style. Authors are encouraged to include a guide \r\nto the design with the fonts. It would also help to have contributions submitted as patches or clearly marked changes \r\n- the use of smart source revision control systems like subversion, svk, mercurial, git or bzr is a good idea. Please \r\nfollow the recommendations given by the author(s) in terms of preferred source formats and configuration parameters \r\nfor sending contributions. If this is not indicated in a FONTLOG or other documentation of the font, consider asking \r\nthem directly. Examples of useful contributions are bug fixes, additional glyphs, stylistic alternates (and the smart \r\nfont code to access them) or improved hinting. Keep in mind that some kinds of changes (esp. hinting) may be technically \r\ndifficult to integrate.\r\n\r\n7.4  How can I financially support the development of OFL fonts?\r\nIt is likely that most authors of OFL fonts would accept financial contributions - contact them for instructions on \r\nhow to do this. Such contributions would support future development. You can also pay for others to enhance the fonts \r\nand contribute the results back to the original authors for inclusion in the Original Version.\r\n\r\n\r\n8  ABOUT THE LICENSE ITSELF\r\n\r\n8.1  I see that this is version 1.1 of the license. Will there be later changes?\r\nVersion 1.1 is the first minor revision of the OFL. We are confident that version 1.1 will meet most needs, but are \r\nopen to future improvements. Any revisions would be for future font releases, and previously existing licenses would \r\nremain in effect. No retroactive changes are possible, although the Copyright Holder(s) can re-release the font under \r\na revised OFL. All versions will be available on our web site: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL.\r\n\r\n8.2  Does this license restrict the rights of the Copyright Holder(s)?\r\nNo. The Copyright Holder(s) still retain(s) all the rights to their creation; they are only releasing a portion of it \r\nfor use in a specific way. For example, the Copyright Holder(s) may choose to release a 'basic' version of their font \r\nunder the OFL, but sell a restricted 'enhanced' version. Only the Copyright Holder(s) can do this.\r\n\r\n8.3  Is the OFL a contract or a license?\r\nThe OFL is a license and not a contract and so does not require you to sign it to have legal validity. By using, modifying \r\nand redistributing components under the OFL you indicate that you accept the license.\r\n\r\n8.4  I really like the terms of the OFL, but want to change it a little. Am I allowed to take ideas and actual wording \r\nfrom the OFL and put them into my own custom license for distributing my fonts?\r\nWe strongly recommend against creating your very own unique open licensing model. Using a modified or derivative license \r\nwill likely cut you off - along with the font(s) under that license - from the community of designers using the OFL, \r\npotentially expose you and your users to legal liabilities, and possibly put your work and rights at risk. The OFL went \r\nthough a community and legal review process that took years of effort, and that review is only applicable to an unmodified \r\nOFL. The text of the OFL has been written by SIL (with review and consultation from the community) and is copyright \r\n(c) 2005-2010 SIL International. You may re-use the ideas and wording (in part, not in whole) in another non-proprietary \r\nlicense provided that you call your license by another unambiguous name, that you do not use the preamble, that you \r\ndo not mention SIL and that you clearly present your license as different from the OFL so as not to cause confusion \r\nby being too similar to the original. If you feel the OFL does not meet your needs for an open license, please contact \r\nus.\r\n\r\n8.5  Can I translate the license and the FAQ into other languages?\r\nSIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not familiar with English to be able to understand the OFL and \r\nits use. Making the license very clear and readable has been a key goal for the OFL, but we know that people understand \r\ntheir own language best.\r\n\r\nIf you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome to translate the OFL and OFL-FAQ so that designers and users \r\nin your language community can understand the license better. But only the original English version of the license has \r\nlegal value and has been approved by the community. Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should only serve \r\nas a way to explain the original license. SIL - as the author and steward of the license for the community at large \r\n- does not approve any translation of the OFL as legally valid because even small translation ambiguities could be abused \r\nand create problems.\r\n\r\nSIL gives permission to publish unofficial translations into other languages provided that they comply with the following \r\nguidelines:\r\n\r\n- Put the following disclaimer in both English and the target language stating clearly that the translation is unofficial:\r\n\r\n\"This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font License into <language_name>. It was not published by SIL International, \r\nand does not legally state the distribution terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under the OFL is only valid \r\nwhen using the original English text. However, we recognize that this unofficial translation will help users and designers \r\nnot familiar with English to better understand and use the OFL. We encourage designers who consider releasing their \r\ncreation under the OFL to read the OFL-FAQ in their own language if it is available. Please go to http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL \r\nfor the official version of the license and the accompanying OFL-FAQ.\"\r\n\r\n- Keep your unofficial translation current and update it at our request if needed, for example if there is any ambiguity \r\nwhich could lead to confusion.  \r\n\r\nIf you start such a unofficial translation effort of the OFL and OFL-FAQ please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n9  ABOUT SIL INTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\n9.1  Who is SIL International and what do they do?\r\nSIL serves language communities worldwide, building their capacity for sustainable language development, by means of \r\nresearch, translation, training and materials development. SIL makes its services available to all without regard to \r\nreligious belief, political ideology, gender, race, or ethnic background. SIL's members and volunteers share a Christian \r\ncommitment.\r\n\r\n9.2  What does this have to do with font licensing?\r\nThe ability to read, write, type and publish in one's own language is one of the most critical needs for millions of \r\npeople around the world. This requires fonts that are widely available and support lesser-known languages. SIL develops \r\n- and encourages others to develop - a complete stack of writing systems implementation components available under open \r\nlicenses. This open stack includes input methods, smart fonts, smart rendering libraries and smart applications. There \r\nhas been a need for a common open license that is specifically applicable to fonts and related software (a crucial component \r\nof this stack), so SIL developed the SIL Open Font License with the help of the Free\/Libre and Open Source Software \r\ncommunity","risk":2,"spdx":"OFL-1.1","trademark":0,"unique_id":"968ed440-dfde-4e83-a122-cd84cc82f7fe"}
