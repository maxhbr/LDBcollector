Special emphasis is given to the preparation of all possible pure exciton states and their maximally entangled Bell states. The general results are illustrated using as an example the pair and quartet centres of neodymium ions in calcium fluoride (M- and N-centres), where all necessary experimental information concerning the interactions and decoherence is available, and experimental preparation of Bell vacuum-single exciton and vacuum-biexciton states has been recently demonstrated. These results can be easily rescaled for the cases of quantum dots and dye molecules. Numerical results are compared with the analytical results obtained for a particular case of the biharmonic excitation of dimers. Excellent agreement between these approaches is demonstrated.  $SKIP19 All rights reserved","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"9a35fbcb-e731-4344-bef1-d29a39346264"}
