As a condition to exercising the rights\r\n        and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\r\n        responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed,\r\n        if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\r\n        allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#039;s\r\n        responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\r\n        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\r\n        license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li>e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor\r\n        makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth\r\n        in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient&#039;s receipt of the\r\n        Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under\r\n        the terms of Section 3).\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ul>\r\n    <h2 id=\"requirements\">3.

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<\/h2>\r\n    <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\r\n      with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\r\n      license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\r\n      Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should\r\n      do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other\r\n      Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\r\n      commercial product offering, such Contributor (&ldquo;Commercial Contributor&rdquo;)\r\n      hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\r\n      (&ldquo;Indemnified Contributor&rdquo;) against any losses, damages and costs\r\n      (collectively &ldquo;Losses&rdquo;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions\r\n      brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent\r\n      caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection\r\n      with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\r\n      The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating\r\n      to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to\r\n      qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the\r\n      Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\r\n      Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,\r\n      the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\r\n      Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program\r\n      in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a\r\n      Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\r\n      claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims\r\n      and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#039;s responsibility alone.\r\n      Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\r\n      against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\r\n      warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages\r\n      as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <h2 id=\"warranty\">5. NO WARRANTY<\/h2>\r\n    <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\r\n      BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT\r\n      WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,\r\n      WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\r\n      MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is\r\n      solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\r\n      distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\r\n      exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the\r\n      risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage\r\n      to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or\r\n      interruption of operations.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <h2 id=\"disclaimer\">6.

GENERAL<\/h2>\r\n    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\r\n      remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\r\n      parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\r\n      necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\r\n      (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\r\n      infringes such Recipient&#039;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#039;s rights granted\r\n      under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>All Recipient&#039;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\r\n      comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\r\n      does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\r\n      aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#039;s rights under this Agreement\r\n      terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program\r\n      as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#039;s obligations under\r\n      this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the\r\n      Program shall continue and survive.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\r\n      but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\r\n      only be modified in the following manner.

No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\r\n      to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\r\n      Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as\r\n      the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of\r\n      the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\r\n      (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version\r\n      of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new\r\n      version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute\r\n      the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\r\n      receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\r\n      Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\r\n      estoppel or otherwise.
