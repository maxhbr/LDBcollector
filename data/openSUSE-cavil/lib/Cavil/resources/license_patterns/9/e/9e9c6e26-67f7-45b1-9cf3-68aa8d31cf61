PREAMBLE<\/h3>\n\n<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document\n&quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a\nway to get credit for their work, while not being considered\nresponsible for modifications made by others.<\/p>\n\n<p>This License is a kind of\n&quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that\nderivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\nsense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a\ncopyleft license designed for free software.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"sect2\"><a name=\"samba2-APP-G-SECT-1.3\"\/>\n\n<h3 class=\"head2\">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/h3>\n\n<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein. The\n&quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any\nsuch manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the\nlicense if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring\npermission under copyright law.<\/p>\n\n<p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the\nDocument means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,\neither copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into\nanother language.<\/p>\n\n<p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named\nappendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals\nexclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the\nDocument to the Document's overall subject (or to\nrelated matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within\nthat overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of\nmathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)\nThe relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the\nsubject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\nphilosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are\ncertain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being\nthose of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the\nDocument is released under this License. If a section does not fit\nthe above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be\ndesignated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant\nSections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections\nthen there are none.<\/p>\n\n<p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short\npassages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover\nTexts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\nthis License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a\nBack-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.<\/p>\n\n<p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the\nDocument means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose\nspecification is available to the general public, that is suitable\nfor revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors\nor (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\ndrawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable\nfor input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\nvariety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made\nin an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of\nmarkup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent\nmodification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\nTransparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that\nis not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called\n&quot;Opaque&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, T<sup class=\"superscript\">E<\/sup>Xinfo input\nformat, L<sup class=\"superscript\">A<\/sup>T<sup class=\"superscript\">E<\/sup>X\ninput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and\nstandard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human\nmodification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF\nand JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read\nand edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\nthe DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.<\/p>\n\n<p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a\nprinted book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are\nneeded to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear\nin the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title\npage as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the\nwork's title, preceding the beginning of the body of\nthe text.<\/p>\n\n<p>A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a\nnamed subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or\ncontains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in\nanother language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name\nmentioned below, such as\n&quot;Acknowledgments&quot;,\n&quot;Dedications&quot;,\n&quot;Endorsements&quot;, or\n&quot;History&quot;.) To\n&quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a\nsection when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\n&quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this\ndefinition.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\nwhich states that this License applies to the Document. These\nWarranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in\nthis License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"sect2\"><a name=\"samba2-APP-G-SECT-1.4\"\/>\n\n<h3 class=\"head2\">2. VERBATIM COPYING<\/h3>\n\n<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"sect2\"><a name=\"samba2-APP-G-SECT-1.5\"\/>\n\n<h3 class=\"head2\">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<\/h3>\n\n<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you\nmust enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\nall these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\nBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and\nlegibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\ncover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\nprominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in\naddition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they\npreserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can\nbe treated as verbatim copying in other respects.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque\ncopy a computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute\nan Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of\nthe Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,\nto give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"9e9c6e26-67f7-45b1-9cf3-68aa8d31cf61"}
