At\r\n      Your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include compiled\r\n      bytecode, object code or binary versions of the corresponding source\r\n      code in the same medium.\r\n\r\n  (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\r\n      modifications made available from any of the Originator(s).  The\r\n      resulting modified Package will still be considered the Standard\r\n      Version, and may be copied, modified and redistributed under the terms\r\n      of the original license of the Standard Version as if it were the\r\n      Standard Version.\r\n\r\n\r\n Permissions for Redistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\r\n\r\n  (4) You may modify your copy of the source code of this Package in any way\r\n      and distribute that Modified Version (either gratis or for a\r\n      Distribution Fee, and with or without a corresponding binary, bytecode\r\n      or object code version of the Modified Version) provided that You\r\n      clearly indicate what changes You made to the Package, and provided\r\n      that You do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n       (a) make the Modified Version available to the Originator(s) of the\r\n           Standard Version, under the exact license of the Standard\r\n           Version, so that the Originator(s) may include your modifications\r\n           into the Standard Version (at their discretion).\r\n\r\n       (b) modify any installation scripts and procedures so that\r\n           installation of the Modified Version will never conflict with an\r\n           installation of the Standard Version, include for each program\r\n           installed by the Modified Version clear documentation describing\r\n           how it differs from the Standard Version, and rename your\r\n           Modified Version so that the name is substantially different from\r\n           the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n       (c) permit and encourage anyone who receives a copy of the Modified\r\n           Version permission to make your modifications Freely Available in\r\n           some specific way.                                               \r\n\r\n      If Your Modified Version is in turn derived from a Modified Version\r\n      made by a third party, then You are still required to ensure that Your\r\n      Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Permissions for Redistribution of Non&#45;Source Versions of Package\r\n\r\n  (5) You may distribute binary, object code, bytecode or other non&#45;source\r\n      versions of the Standard Version of the Package, provided that you\r\n      include complete instructions on where to get the source code of the\r\n      Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of Your\r\n      distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while You are\r\n      carrying our such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new\r\n      instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If You cease\r\n      distribution within thirty days after You become aware that the\r\n      instructions are invalid, then You do not forfeit any of Your rights\r\n      under this license.\r\n\r\n  (6) You may distribute binary, object code, bytecode or other non&#45;source\r\n      versions of a Modified Version provided that You do at least ONE of\r\n      the following:\r\n\r\n       (a) include a copy of the corresponding source code for the Modified\r\n           Version under the terms indicated in (4).\r\n\r\n       (b) ensure that the installation of Your non&#45;source Modified Version\r\n           does not conflict in any way with an installation of the Standard\r\n           Version, include for each program installed by the Modified\r\n           Version clear documentation describing how it differs from the\r\n           Standard Version, and rename your Modified Version so that the\r\n           name is substantially different from the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n       (c) ensure that the Modified Version includes notification of the\r\n           changes made from the Standard Version, and offer to provide\r\n           machine&#45;readable source code (under a license that permits making\r\n           that source code Freely Available) of the Modified Version via\r\n           mail order.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Permissions for Inclusion of the Package in Aggregate Works\r\n  \r\n  (7) You may aggregate this Package (either the Standard Version or\r\n      Modified Version) with other packages and distribute the resulting\r\n      aggregation provided that You do not charge a licensing fee for the\r\n      Package.  Distribution Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for\r\n      other packages in the aggregation are permitted.  Your permission to\r\n      distribute Standard or Modified Versions of the Package is still\r\n      subject to the other terms set forth in other sections of this\r\n      license.\r\n\r\n  (8) In addition to the permissions given elsewhere by this license, You\r\n      are also permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions of this\r\n      Package with other works and distribute the result without\r\n      restriction, provided You have produced binary program(s) that do not\r\n      overtly expose the interfaces of the Package.  This includes\r\n      permission to embed the Package in a larger work of your own without\r\n      exposing a direct interface to the Package.  This also includes\r\n      permission to build stand&#45;alone binary or bytecode versions of your\r\n      scripts that require the Package, but do not otherwise give the casual\r\n      user direct access to the Package itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Items That are Never Considered Part of a Modified Version Package\r\n\r\n  (9) Works (including, but not limited to, subroutines and scripts) that\r\n      you have linked or aggregated with the Package that merely extend or\r\n      make use of the Package, but are not intended to cause the Package to\r\n      operate differently from the Standard Version, do not, by themselves,\r\n      cause the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works\r\n      are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not bound by\r\n      the terms of the Package&#39;s license.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Acceptance of License and Disclaimer of Warranty\r\n\r\n (10) You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\r\n      it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify or\r\n      distribute the Standard or Modified Versions of the Package.  These\r\n      actions are prohibited by copyright law if you do not accept this\r\n      License.  Therefore, by copying, modifying or distributing Standard\r\n      and Modified Versions of the Package, you indicate your acceptance of\r\n      the license of the Package.\r\n\r\n\r\n (11) Disclaimer of Warranty:\r\n\r\n       THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\r\n       &#34;AS IS&#34; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\r\n       LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\r\n       A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
