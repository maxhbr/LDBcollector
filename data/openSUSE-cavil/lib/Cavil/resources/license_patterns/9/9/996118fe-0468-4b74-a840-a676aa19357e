{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL-2.1+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\t\tGNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\\\\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\\end{center}\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"996118fe-0468-4b74-a840-a676aa19357e"}
