PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and\nuseful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the eﬀective freedom\nto copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications\nmade by others.\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document\nmust themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public\nLicense, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because\nfree software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals\nproviding the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to\nsoftware manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms\nof this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in\nduration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”,\nbelow, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and\nis addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work\nin a way requiring permission under copyright law.\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or\na portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into\nanother language","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"9dd84797-a0d8-41a4-9134-06eaad385dde"}
