{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.1","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not\r\nprice.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers\r\ncharge a price for printed copies---that in itself is fine.  (The Free\r\nSoftware Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The\r\nproblem is the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals\r\nare available in source code form, and give you permission to copy and\r\nmodify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.\r\n\r\nThe criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for\r\nfree software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of\r\ncommercial redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can\r\naccompany every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.\r\n\r\nPermission for modification of the technical content is crucial too.\r\nWhen people modify the software, adding or changing features, if they\r\nare conscientious they will change the manual too---so they can\r\nprovide accurate and clear documentation for the modified program.  A\r\nmanual that leaves you no choice but to write a new manual to document\r\na changed version of the program is not really available to our\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of limits on the way modification is handled are\r\nacceptable.  For example, requirements to preserve the original\r\nauthor's copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of\r\nauthors, are ok.  It is also no problem to require modified versions\r\nto include notice that they were modified.  Even entire sections that\r\nmay not be deleted or changed are acceptable, as long as they deal\r\nwith nontechnical topics (like this one).  These kinds of restrictions\r\nare acceptable because they don't obstruct the community's normal use\r\nof the manual.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be possible to modify all the @emph{technical}\r\ncontent of the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual\r\nmedia, through all the usual channels.  Otherwise, the restrictions\r\nobstruct the use of the manual, it is not free, and we need another\r\nmanual to replace it.\r\n\r\nPlease spread the word about this issue.  Our community continues to\r\nlose manuals to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that\r\nfree software needs free reference manuals and free tutorials, perhaps\r\nthe next person who wants to contribute by writing documentation will\r\nrealize, before it is too late, that only free manuals contribute to\r\nthe free software community.\r\n\r\nIf you are writing documentation, please insist on publishing it under\r\nthe GNU Free Documentation License or another free documentation\r\nlicense.  Remember that this decision requires your approval---you\r\ndon't have to let the publisher decide.  Some commercial publishers\r\nwill use a free license if you insist, but they will not propose the\r\noption; it is up to you to raise the issue and say firmly that this is\r\nwhat you want.  If the publisher you are dealing with refuses, please\r\ntry other publishers.  If you're not sure whether a proposed license\r\nis free, write to @email{licensing@@gnu.org}.\r\n\r\nYou can encourage commercial publishers to sell more free, copylefted\r\nmanuals and tutorials by buying them, and particularly by buying","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f10d90ca-fe25-4787-bfe4-6f2924c7dae9"}
