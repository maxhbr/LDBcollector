The most recent original version of xinetd was 2.1.1 with patches\nbringing it up to 2.1.8. Nick Hilliard created xinetd 2.2.1, based off an\nunreleased xinetd 2.2.0 by Panos. The copyright included with xinetd\nspecified the required versioning to be the official release of xinetd\n(2.1.8 in this case) and a fourth version number tacked on to indicate the\nmodification level. This is the versioning I have adopted. xinetd 2.1.8.X,\nwhich is available here, is not based off xinetd 2.2.0 or higher. It was\ncreated from the codebase of xinetd 2.1.8, although I have re-implemented\nsome of the features introduced in xinetd-2.2.1","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"fde08367-7536-4148-8567-7f5836d9c9f7"}
