PREAMBLE\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and\r\nuseful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom\r\nto copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\r\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications\r\nmade by others.\r\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document\r\nmust themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public\r\nLicense, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because\r\nfree software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals\r\nproviding the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to\r\nsoftware manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\r\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\r\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a\r\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms\r\nof this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in\r\nduration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”,\r\nbelow, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and\r\nis addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work\r\nin a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or\r\na portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into\r\nanother language.\r\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document\r\nthat deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document\r\nto the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that\r\ncould fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a\r\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The\r\nrelationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related\r\nmatters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as\r\nbeing those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released\r\nunder this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is\r\nnot allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant\r\nSections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover\r\nTexts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\r\nthis License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may\r\nbe at most 25 words.\r\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented\r\nin a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for\r\nrevising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing\r\neditor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to\r\na variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise\r\nTransparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to\r\nthwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image\r\nformat is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is\r\nnot “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without\r\nmarkup, Texinfo input format, LaTEX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly\r\navailable DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed\r\nfor human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF\r\nand JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited\r\nonly by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript\r\nor PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following\r\npages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the\r\ntitle page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page”\r\nmeans the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the\r\nbeginning of the body of the text.\r\nThe “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document\r\nto the public.\r\nA section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either\r\nis precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in\r\nanother language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such\r\nas “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve\r\nthe Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\r\nsection “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that\r\nthis License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to\r\nbe included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:\r\nany other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no\r\neffect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or\r\nnoncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license\r\nnotice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and\r\nthat you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use\r\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies\r\nyou make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.\r\nIf you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions\r\nin section 3.\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly\r\ndisplay copies.\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of\r\nthe Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires\r\nCover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all\r\nthese Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\r\nthe back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\r\nof these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\r\nequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\r\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\r\nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\r\nrespects.\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put\r\nthe first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the\r\nrest onto adjacent pages.\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\r\nyou must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque\r\ncopy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which\r\nthe general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network\r\nprotocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If\r\nyou use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\r\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\r\nremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time\r\nyou distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\r\nedition to the public.\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well\r\nbefore redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you\r\nwith an updated version of the Document.\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions\r\nof sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely\r\nthis License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing\r\ndistribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of\r\nit. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the\r\nDocument, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any,\r\nbe listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as\r\na previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for\r\nauthorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five\r\nof the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer\r\nthan five), unless they release you from this requirement.\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the\r\npublisher.\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other\r\ncopyright notices.\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public\r\npermission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form\r\nshown in the Addendum below.\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover\r\nTexts given in the Document’s license notice.\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\nI. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item\r\nstating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version\r\nas given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document\r\nas given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as\r\nstated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to\r\na Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in\r\nthe Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the\r\n“History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published\r\nat least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the\r\nversion it refers to gives permission.\r\nK. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve the Title\r\nof the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the\r\ncontributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and\r\nin their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the\r\nsection titles.\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included\r\nin the Modified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to conflict in\r\ntitle with any Invariant Section.\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify\r\nas Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\nyour option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their\r\ntitles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These\r\ntitles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\nYou may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but\r\nendorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of\r\npeer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\r\ndefinition of a standard.\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up\r\nto 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified\r\nVersion. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\r\nadded by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already\r\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement\r\nmade by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but\r\nyou may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that\r\nadded the old one.\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission\r\nto use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified\r\nVersion.\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\r\nunder the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you\r\ninclude in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\r\nunmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\r\nnotice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\r\nInvariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\r\nSections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section\r\nunique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\r\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment\r\nto the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined\r\nwork.\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any\r\nsections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You\r\nmust delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\r\nunder this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various\r\ndocuments with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you\r\nfollow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\r\nother respects.\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted\r\ndocument, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\r\nthat document.\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent\r\ndocuments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called\r\nan “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the\r\nlegal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When\r\nthe Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other\r\nworks in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\r\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover\r\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\r\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they\r\nmust appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations\r\nof the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with\r\ntranslations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may\r\ninclude translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions\r\nof these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\r\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you\r\nalso include the original English version of this License and the original versions of\r\nthose notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and\r\nthe original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\r\nprevail.\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\r\nchanging the actual title.\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or\r\ndistribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular\r\ncopyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder\r\nexplicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\r\nafter the cessation.\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if\r\nthe copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the\r\nfirst time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\r\nnotice.\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\r\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have\r\nbeen terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the\r\nsame material does not give you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\r\nDocumentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\r\nto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\nSee http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\r\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version”\r\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nspecified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a\r\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\r\n11. RELICENSING\r\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide\r\nWeb server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities\r\nfor anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of\r\nsuch a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the\r\nsite means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\r\n“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal\r\nplace of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that\r\nlicense published by that same organization.\r\n“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part\r\nof another Document.\r\nAn MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works\r\nthat were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and\r\nsubsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts\r\nor invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under\r\nCC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is\r\neligible for relicensing.\r\n\r\n\fAppendix A: Copying Information\r\n\r\n$SKIP10\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the\r\ndocument and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\r\nCopyright (C) year your name.\r\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\r\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\r\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\r\nTexts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ‘‘GNU\r\nFree Documentation License’’.\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the\r\n“with. . . Texts.” line with this:\r\nwith the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with\r\nthe Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts\r\nbeing list.\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three,\r\nmerge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\r\nthese examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU\r\nGeneral Public License, to permit their use in free software","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f9ccd51a-aa4b-49f8-96f7-a762f0e6a87b"}
