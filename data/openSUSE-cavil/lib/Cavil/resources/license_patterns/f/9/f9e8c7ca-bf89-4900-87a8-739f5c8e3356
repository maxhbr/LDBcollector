{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-3.0+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe \\s-1GNU\\s0 General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program\\*(--to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,\nuse the \\s-1GNU\\s0 General Public License for most of our software; it\napplies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\n.PP\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n.PP\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n.PP\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,\nreceive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these\nterms so they know their rights.\n.PP\nDevelopers that use the \\s-1GNU\\s0 \\s-1GPL\\s0 protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\n.PP\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the \\s-1GPL\\s0 clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the \\s-1GPL\\s0 requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n.PP\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the \\s-1GPL\\s0 to prohibit the\npractice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the \\s-1GPL\\s0, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n.PP\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the \\s-1GPL\\s0\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n.PP\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n.Sh \"\\s-1TERMS\\s0 \\s-1AND\\s0 \\s-1CONDITIONS\\s0\"\n.IX Subsection \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS\"\n.IP \"0.

Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n.Sp\nTo \\*(L\"convey\\*(R\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n.Sp\nAn interactive user interface displays \\*(L\"Appropriate Legal Notices\\*(R\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n.IP \"1. Source Code.\" 4\n.IX Item \"1.

A\n\\&\\*(L\"Major Component\\*(R\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n.Sp\nThe \\*(L\"Corresponding Source\\*(R\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n.Sp\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n.Sp\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n.IP \"2.

Basic Permissions.\"\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.

Conveying Verbatim Copies.\"\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n.Sp\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n.IP \"5.
