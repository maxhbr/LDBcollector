Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative \r\nCommons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties \r\nregarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative \r\nCommons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible. Using Creative \r\nCommons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators \r\nand other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain \r\nother rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, \r\nare not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended \r\nfor use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright \r\nand certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions \r\nof the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our \r\nlicenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject \r\nto the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. \r\nMore considerations for licensors. Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants \r\nthe public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission \r\nis not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then \r\nthat use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights \r\nthat a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including \r\nbecause others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking \r\nthat all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those \r\nrequests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License\r\n\r\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this \r\nCreative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\").

Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and\/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without \r\nlimitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights \r\nare labeled or categorized.

For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context \r\nin which You Share the Licensed Material.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent \r\nreasonably practicable.\r\n\r\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a \r\nsubstantial portion of the contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;\r\n\r\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis \r\nDatabase Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is \r\nAdapted Material; and\r\n\r\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of \r\nthe database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License \r\nwhere the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\na. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed \r\nMaterial as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, \r\nwhether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, \r\nfitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or \r\nabsence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, \r\nnegligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other \r\nlosses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the \r\nLicensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability \r\nis not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to \r\nthe extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\n\r\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail \r\nto comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\n\r\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the \r\nviolation; or\r\n\r\n2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for \r\nYour violations of this Public License.\r\n\r\nd. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions \r\nor stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\ne. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly \r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from \r\nand independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\n\r\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, \r\nor impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public \r\nLicense.\r\n\r\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically \r\nreformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed \r\nfrom this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly \r\nagreed to by the Licensor.\r\n\r\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges \r\nand immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
