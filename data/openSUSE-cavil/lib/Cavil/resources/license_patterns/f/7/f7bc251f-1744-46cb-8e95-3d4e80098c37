If an inspection or audit uncovers additional usage by You for\r\n        which fees are owed under this Agreement, then You shall pay for such\r\n        additional usage at Cockroach Labs’ then-current rates.\r\n\r\n  5.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any\r\n     Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in CockroachDB by You to\r\n     Cockroach Labs shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n\r\n         https:\/\/cla-assistant.io\/cockroachdb\/cockroach\r\n\r\n     (which is based off of the Apache License), without any additional terms or\r\n     conditions, payments of royalties or otherwise to Your benefit.\r\n     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the\r\n     terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed with\r\n     Cockroach Labs regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n  8.

Cockroach Labs’ warranties in this Section 9 do not extend\r\n        to problems that result from: (i) Your failure to implement updates\r\n        issued by Cockroach Labs during the warranty period; (ii) any\r\n        alterations or additions (including Enterprise Derivative Works and\r\n        Contributions) to CockroachDB not performed by or at the direction of\r\n        Cockroach Labs; (iii) failures that are not reproducible by Cockroach\r\n        Labs; (iv) operation of CockroachDB Enterprise Edition in violation of\r\n        this Agreement or not in accordance with its documentation; (v) failures\r\n        caused by software, hardware or products not licensed or provided by\r\n        Cockroach Labs hereunder; or (vi) Third Party Works.\r\n\r\n    (c) Remedies.

This is Your exclusive remedy, and\r\n        Cockroach Labs’ sole liability, arising in connection with the limited\r\n        warranties herein.\r\n\r\n  10. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Except as set out in Section 9, unless required\r\n      by applicable law, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor\r\n      provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR\r\n      CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, arising out of course\r\n      of dealing, course of performance, or usage in trade, including, without\r\n      limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\r\n      MERCHANTABILITY, CORRECTNESS, RELIABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n      PURPOSE, all of which are hereby disclaimed.  You are solely responsible\r\n      for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing Works and\r\n      assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under the\r\n      applicable License for such Works.\r\n\r\n  11. Limited Indemnity.\r\n\r\n    (a) Indemnity.  Cockroach Labs will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless\r\n        against any third party claims, liabilities or expenses incurred\r\n        (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), as well as amounts finally\r\n        awarded in a settlement or a non-appealable judgement by a court\r\n        (\"Losses\"), to the extent arising from any claim or allegation by a\r\n        third party that CockroachDB Enterprise Edition infringes or\r\n        misappropriates a valid United States patent, copyright or trade secret\r\n        right of a third party; provided that You give Cockroach Labs: (i)\r\n        prompt written notice of any such claim or allegation; (ii) sole control\r\n        of the defense and settlement thereof; and (iii) reasonable cooperation\r\n        and assistance in such defense or settlement.  If any Work within\r\n        CockroachDB Enterprise Edition becomes or, in Cockroach Labs’ opinion,\r\n        is likely to become, the subject of an injunction, Cockroach Labs may,\r\n        at its option, (A) procure for You the right to continue using such\r\n        Work, (B) replace or modify such Work so that it becomes non-infringing\r\n        without substantially compromising its functionality, or, if (A) and (B)\r\n        are not commercially practicable, then (C) terminate Your license to the\r\n        allegedly infringing Work and refund to You a prorated portion of the\r\n        prepaid and unearned fees for such infringing Work.  The foregoing\r\n        states the entire liability of Cockroach Labs with respect to\r\n        infringement of patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual\r\n        property rights.\r\n\r\n    (b) Exclusions.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to: (i) Works\r\n        modified by any party other than Cockroach Labs (including Enterprise\r\n        Derivative Works and Contributions), if the alleged infringement relates\r\n        to such modification, (ii) Works combined or bundled with any products,\r\n        processes or materials not provided by Cockroach Labs where the alleged\r\n        infringement relates to such combination, (iii) use of a version of\r\n        CockroachDB Enterprise Edition other than the version that was current\r\n        at the time of such use, as long as a non-infringing version had been\r\n        released, (iv) any Works created to Your specifications, (v)\r\n        infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in which You\r\n        have an interest, or (vi) Third Party Works.  You will defend, indemnify\r\n        and hold Cockroach Labs harmless against any Losses arising from any\r\n        such claim or allegation, subject to conditions reciprocal to those in\r\n        Section 11(a).\r\n\r\n  12. Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal or equitable\r\n      theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the\r\n      contrary, shall Licensor or any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any\r\n      amounts in excess, in the aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Cockroach\r\n      Labs under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the date the\r\n      first cause of liability arose), or (ii) any indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or consequential damages of any\r\n      character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or\r\n      inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss\r\n      of goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer failure or\r\n      malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or\r\n      services, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\r\n      Licensor or Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\r\n      damages. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE\r\n      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\r\n\r\n  13. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.  While redistributing Works or\r\n      Derivative Works thereof, and without limiting your obligations under\r\n      Section 6, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\r\n      support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and\/or rights\r\n      consistent with this License.  However, in accepting such obligations, You\r\n      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on\r\n      behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold Cockroach Labs and each other Contributor harmless for\r\n      any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by\r\n      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n  14. General.\r\n\r\n    (a) Relationship of Parties.  You and Cockroach Labs are independent\r\n        contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either\r\n        party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as\r\n        joint venturers or partners for any purpose.\r\n\r\n    (b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\r\n        Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and\r\n        regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable\r\n        U.S. and foreign authority.\r\n\r\n    (c) Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may\r\n        not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the\r\n        prior written consent of Cockroach Labs.  Any assignment in violation of\r\n        this provision is void.
