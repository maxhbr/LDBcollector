By contrast, the GNU General Public \n      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change \n      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. \n      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software \n      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit \n      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered \n      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it \n      to your programs, too.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. \n      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the \n      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \n      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you \n      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free \n      programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone \n      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
