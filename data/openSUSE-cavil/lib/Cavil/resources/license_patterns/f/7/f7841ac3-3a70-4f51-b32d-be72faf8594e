{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.1","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"4. MODIFICATIONS\n\n     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document\n     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you\n     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with\n     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus\n     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to\n     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these\n     things in the Modified Version:\n\n       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title\n          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of\n          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed\n          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the\n          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of\n          that version gives permission.\n\n       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or\n          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in\n          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the\n          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal\n          authors, if it has less than five).\n\n       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n          Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n          adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license\n          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified\n          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in\n          the Addendum below.\n\n       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant\n          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's\n          license notice.\n\n       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n       I. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and\n          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new\n          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on\n          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled \"History\" in\n          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,\n          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,\n          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in\n          the previous sentence.\n\n       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document\n          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and\n          likewise the network locations given in the Document for\n          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in\n          the \"History\" section.  You may omit a network location for a\n          work that was published at least four years before the\n          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version\n          it refers to gives permission.\n\n       K. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgments\" or \"Dedications\",\n          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all\n          the substance and tone of each of the contributor\n          acknowledgments and\/or dedications given therein.\n\n       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section\n          titles.\n\n       M. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n          may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n       N. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to\n          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no\n     material copied from the Document, you may at your option\n     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,\n     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\n     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any\n     other section titles.\n\n     You may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\n     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text\n     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\n     definition of a standard.\n\n     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,\n     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end\n     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one\n     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\n     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the\n     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity\n     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\n     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous\n     publisher that added the old one.\n\n     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this\n     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to\n     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n     You may combine the Document with other documents released under\n     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for\n     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\n     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\n     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your\n     combined work in its license notice.\n\n     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\n     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\n     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the\n     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\n     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in\n     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n     combined work.\n\n     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled\n     \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\n     entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled\n     \"Acknowledgments\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You\n     must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\n     documents released under this License, and replace the individual\n     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\n     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the\n     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\n     documents in all other respects.\n\n     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\n     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert\n     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow\n     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\n     that document.\n\n  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of\n     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a\n     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation\n     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is\n     called an \"aggregate\", and this License does not apply to the\n     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on\n     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves\n     derivative works of the Document.\n\n     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one\n     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be\n     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the\n     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole\n     aggregate.\n\n  8. TRANSLATION\n\n     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section\n     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n     translation of this License provided that you also include the\n     original English version of this License.  In case of a\n     disagreement between the translation and the original English\n     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.\n\n  9. TERMINATION\n\n     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other\n     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is\n     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n     from you under this License will not have their licenses\n     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of\n     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n     `http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/'.\n\n     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version\n     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered\n     version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\n     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n     that specified version or of any later version that has been\n     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If\n     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,\n     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the\n     Free Software Foundation","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f7841ac3-3a70-4f51-b32d-be72faf8594e"}
