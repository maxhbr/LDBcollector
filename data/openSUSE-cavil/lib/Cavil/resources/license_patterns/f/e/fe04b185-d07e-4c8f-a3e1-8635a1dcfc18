By contrast, the GNU General Public License is \n      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change \n      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. \n      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software \n      Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit \n      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered \n      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it \n      to your programs, too.<\/para>\n\n    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. \n      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the \n      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \n      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you \n      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free \n      programs; and that you know you can do these things.<\/para>\n\n    <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone \n      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These \n      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \n      copies of the software, or if you modify it.<\/para>\n\n    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \n      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You \n      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you \n      must show them these terms so they know their rights.<\/para>\n\n    <para>We protect your rights with two steps:\n      <orderedlist>\n\t<listitem>\n\t  <para>copyright the software, and<\/para>\n\t<\/listitem>\n\t<listitem>\n\t  <para>offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, \n\t    distribute and\/or modify the software.<\/para>\n\t<\/listitem>\n      <\/orderedlist>\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that \n      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If \n      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its \n      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any \n      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos; \n      reputations.<\/para>\n\n    <para>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. \n      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will \n      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program \n      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be \n      licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.<\/para>\n\n    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification \n      follow.<\/para>\n  <\/section>\n  <section id=\"gpl-2\">\n    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/title>\n    <section id=\"gpl-2-0\">\n      <title>Section 0<\/title>\n      <para>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice \n\tplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms \n\tof this General Public License.

(Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but does not \n              normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not \n              required to print an   announcement.)<\/para>\n\t  <\/listitem>\n\t<\/orderedlist>\n      <\/para>\n\n      <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

However, as a special exception, the source \n\tcode distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or \n\tbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system \n\ton which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<\/para>\n\n      <para>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a \n\tdesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place \n\tcounts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to \n\tcopy the source along with the object code.<\/para>\n    <\/section>\n    <section id=\"gpl-2-4\">\n      <title>Section 4<\/title>\n      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided \n\tunder this License.

However, nothing \n\telse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. \n\tThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously \n\tyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence \n\tyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \n\troyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or \n\tindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be \n\tto refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<\/para>\n\n      <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, \n\tthe balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply \n\tin other circumstances.<\/para>\n\n      <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property \n\tright claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of \n\tprotecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public \n\tlicense practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \n\tdistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up \n\tto the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other \n\tsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<\/para>\n\n      <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the \n\trest of this License.<\/para>\n    <\/section>\n    <section id=\"gpl-2-8\">\n      <title>Section 8<\/title>\n      <para>If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents \n\tor by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License \n\tmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that \n\tdistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
