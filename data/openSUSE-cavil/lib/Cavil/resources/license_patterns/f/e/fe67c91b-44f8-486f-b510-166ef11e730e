Limitations on Grant Scope\r\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses \r\nwill be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) \r\nabove, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\r\n\r\nfor any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\r\n\r\nfor infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination \r\nof its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\r\n\r\nunder Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\r\n\r\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may \r\nbe necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\r\n\r\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\r\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent \r\nversion of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of \r\nSection 3.3).\r\n\r\n2.5.

Conditions\r\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\r\n\r\n3. Responsibilities\r\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\r\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You \r\ncontribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered \r\nSoftware is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt \r\nto alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\r\n\r\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\r\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\r\n\r\nsuch Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform \r\nrecipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely \r\nmanner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\r\n\r\nYou may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided \r\nthat the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code \r\nForm under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\r\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements \r\nof this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed \r\nby one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License \r\npermits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the \r\nrecipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either \r\nthis License or such Secondary License(s).\r\n\r\n3.4. Notices\r\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers \r\nof warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that \r\nYou may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\r\n\r\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\r\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more \r\nrecipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. \r\nYou must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by \r\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result \r\nof warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and \r\nlimitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered \r\nSoftware due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the \r\nmaximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed \r\nin a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited \r\nby statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able \r\nto understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Termination\r\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. \r\nHowever, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated \r\n(a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing \r\nbasis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after \r\nYou have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing \r\nbasis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have \r\nreceived notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days \r\nafter Your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment \r\nactions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any \r\npatent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this \r\nLicense shall terminate.\r\n\r\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors \r\nand resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall \r\nsurvive termination.\r\n\r\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, \r\nimplied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, \r\nfit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software \r\nis with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of \r\nany necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. \r\nNo use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n7. Limitation of Liability\r\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall \r\nany Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, \r\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, \r\nloss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, \r\neven if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not \r\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law \r\nprohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential \r\ndamages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n8. Litigation\r\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains \r\nits principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference \r\nto its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or \r\ncounter-claims.\r\n\r\n9. Miscellaneous\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License \r\nis held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any \r\nlaw or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be \r\nused to construe this License against a Contributor.\r\n\r\n10. Versions of the License\r\n10.1. New Versions\r\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward \r\nhas the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version \r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\r\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received \r\nthe Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n10.3. Modified Versions\r\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may \r\ncreate and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of \r\nthe license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\r\n\r\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\r\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version \r\nof the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\r\n\r\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
