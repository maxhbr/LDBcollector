The exceptions read:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n   ---- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----\r\n\r\n   As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions\r\n   of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you\r\n   may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying\r\n   with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.\r\n\r\n   In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with\r\n   software that is licensed under the GPLv2 (\"Combined Software\") and if a\r\n   court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section\r\n   3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License\r\n   conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and\r\n   prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of\r\n   the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined\r\n   Software.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and available under a permissive\r\nlicense - this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM by\r\n**allowing commercial products to be derived from LLVM** with few restrictions\r\nand without a requirement for making any derived works also open source.  In\r\nparticular, LLVM's license is not a \"copyleft\" license like the GPL.\r\n\r\nThe \"Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions\" allows you to:\r\n\r\n* freely download and use LLVM (in whole or in part) for personal, internal, or\r\n  commercial purposes.\r\n* include LLVM in packages or distributions you create.\r\n* combine LLVM with code licensed under every other major open source\r\n  license (including BSD, MIT, GPLv2, GPLv3...).\r\n* make changes to LLVM code without being required to contribute it back\r\n  to the project - contributions are appreciated though!\r\n\r\nHowever, it imposes these limitations on you:\r\n\r\n* You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM: You cannot\r\n  strip the copyright headers off or replace them with your own.\r\n* Binaries that include LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an\r\n  included README file or in an \"About\" box), unless the LLVM code was added as\r\n  a by-product of compilation.  For example, if an LLVM runtime library like\r\n  compiler_rt or libc++ was automatically included into your application by the\r\n  compiler, you do not need to attribute it.\r\n* You can't use our names to promote your products (LLVM derived or not) -\r\n  though you can make truthful statements about your use of the LLVM code,\r\n  without implying our sponsorship.\r\n* There's no warranty on LLVM at all.\r\n\r\nWe want LLVM code to be widely used, and believe that this provides a model that\r\nis great for contributors and users of the project.
