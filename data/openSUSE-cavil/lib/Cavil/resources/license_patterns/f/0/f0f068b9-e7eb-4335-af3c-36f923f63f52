The\n   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n\n   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n\n   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n      distributed by us.\n   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n\n\nANNOTATIONS\n===========\n\n  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n\n  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n    by definition.\n\n  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n\n  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f0f068b9-e7eb-4335-af3c-36f923f63f52"}
