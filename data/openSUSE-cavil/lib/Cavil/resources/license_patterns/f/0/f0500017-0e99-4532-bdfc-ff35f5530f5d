The software cannot be put on Debian's main repository\n      because your file has no license information in the header.\n\n      On your website I found that \"All downloadable software is offered freely and without\n      restriction\". I'm writing you to ask if you can add a sentence like that (\"This software\n      is offered freely...\") to the header of rpoly.cpp file (which put that file under Public\n      Domain) or if you can release that file under a GPL-compatible license\n      http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses adding to the header\n      the proper notice.\n\n\n      Thank you very much, best regards\n      Simone\n\n \n -----(2)----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Date: Sun, 30 Jan 2011 09:35:24 -0700 (GMT-07:00)\n   From: $SKIP30\n   To: Simone Rossetto <simros85@gmail.com>\n   Subject: Re: License for rpoly.cpp file\n\n      Hi Simone,\n\n      Thanks for your interest in rpoly.cpp.\n\n      I have placed rpoly.cpp completely in\n      the public domain. That means there are\n      no restrictions whatsoever in its use\n      by others. You may use or modify it in\n      any way that suits your purposes. I do\n      not require any citations or acknowledgmentsI\n      It may also be repackaged or bundled\n      with other software. \n\n      If any bugs or performance problems are\n      discovered, I will try to correct them,\n      so please notify me if any are found.\n\n      Some of the software on my website carry\n      weak copyright notices, but they are\n      only there to limit proliferation during\n      early, debug stages of development.\n\n      Best regards and good luck,\n\n      C. R. Bond, crb@crbond.com\n\n      P.S. These permissions for unrestricted\n      use allow you to place any notices of\n      your choice into the versions of rpoly.cpp\n      that you distribute","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f0500017-0e99-4532-bdfc-ff35f5530f5d"}
