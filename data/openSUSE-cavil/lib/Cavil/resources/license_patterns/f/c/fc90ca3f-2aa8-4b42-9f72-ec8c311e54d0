Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative \r\nCommons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties \r\nregarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative \r\nCommons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\r\n\r\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\r\n\r\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders \r\nmay use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified \r\nin the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and \r\ndo not form part of our licenses.\r\n\r\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission \r\nto use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors \r\nshould read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should \r\nalso secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. \r\nLicensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or \r\nmaterial used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\r\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the \r\nlicensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for \r\nexample, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. \r\nOur licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. \r\nUse of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other \r\nrights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. \r\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Where a limitation of liability \r\nis not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the \r\nextent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\n\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to \r\ncomply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation;\r\n or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your \r\nviolations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or \r\nstop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly \r\nagreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from \r\nand independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, \r\nor impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public \r\nLicense.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed \r\nto the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from \r\nthis Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed \r\nto by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges \r\nand immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
