A copy of the\nexceptions and licenses follow this introduction.\n\nThe GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries\nlocated in the \"cups\" and \"filter\" subdirectories of the CUPS\nsource distribution and in the \"cups\" include directory and\nlibrary files in the binary distributions. The GNU GPL applies to\nthe remainder of the CUPS distribution, including the \"pdftops\"\nfilter which is based upon Xpdf.\n\nFor those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically\nallows you to:\n\n   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.\n   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or\n     binary form.\n   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or\n     sell support for the software.\n\nWhat this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or\nadd features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without\nsource code. You must provide source for any changes or additions\nto the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or\nLGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions\nof the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system\nlicense exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.\n\nThe GNU LGPL relaxes the \"link-to\" restriction, allowing you to\ndevelop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries\nunder other licenses and\/or conditions as appropriate for your\napplication, driver, or filter.\n\n\nLICENSE EXCEPTIONS\n\nIn addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants\nthe following special exceptions:\n\n     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;\n\n\ta. Software that is developed by any person or entity\n\t   for an Apple Operating System (\"Apple OS-Developed\n\t   Software\"), including but not limited to Apple and\n\t   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends\n\t   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the\n\t   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters\n\t   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be\n\t   considered to be a derivative work or collective work\n\t   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the\n\t   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.\n\t   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of\n\t   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed\n\t   Software without releasing the source code of the\n\t   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample\n\t   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop\n\t   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the\n\t   source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.\n\n\tb. An Apple Operating System means any operating system\n\t   software developed and\/or marketed by Apple Computer,\n\t   Inc., including but not limited to all existing\n\t   releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,\n\t   and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on\n\t   releases and future versions thereof.\n\n\tc. This exception is only available for Apple\n\t   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software\n\t   that is distributed for use on other operating\n\t   systems.\n\n\td. All CUPS software that falls under this license\n\t   exception have the following text at the top of each\n\t   source file:\n\n\t     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed\n\t     Software exception.\n\n     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;\n\n\ta. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and\n\t   distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL\n\t   Toolkit.\n\nNo developer is required to provide these exceptions in a\nderived work.\n\n\nKERBEROS SUPPORT CODE\n\nThe Kerberos support code (\"KSC\") is copyright 2006 by Jelmer\nVernooij and is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied\nwarranty.  In no event will the author or Apple Inc. be held\nliable for any damages arising from the use of the KSC.\n\nSources files containing KSC have the following text at the top\nof each source file:\n\n     This file contains Kerberos support code, copyright 2006 by\n     Jelmer Vernooij.\n\nThe KSC copyright and license apply only to Kerberos-related\nfeature code in CUPS.  Such code is typically conditionally\ncompiled based on the present of the HAVE_GSSAPI preprocessor\ndefinition.\n\nPermission is granted to anyone to use the KSC for any purpose,\nincluding commercial applications, and to alter it and\nredistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:\n\n     1. The origin of the KSC must not be misrepresented; you\n\tmust not claim that you wrote the original software. If\n\tyou use the KSC in a product, an acknowledgment in the\n\tproduct documentation would be appreciated but is not\n\trequired.\n\n     2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such,\n\tand must not be misrepresented as being the original\n\tsoftware.\n\n     3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source\n\tdistribution. \n\n\nTRADEMARKS\n\nApple Inc. has trademarked the Common UNIX Printing System, CUPS,\nand CUPS logo.
