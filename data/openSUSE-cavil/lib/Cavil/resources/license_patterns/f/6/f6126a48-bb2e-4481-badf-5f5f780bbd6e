LICENSE:\r\n\r\n  a. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AMD grants\r\n     You the following non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,\r\n     limited copyright license to (i) download, copy and use the\r\n     object code version of the Software and materials associated with\r\n     this Agreement, including without limitation printed\r\n     documentation, (collectively, “Materials”) for internal use only\r\n     for support of AMD processors; and (ii) make and distribute\r\n     copies of the Materials for use only with Your products that\r\n     support AMD processors and in computer systems including AMD\r\n     processors, provided that Licensee agrees to include all\r\n     copyright legends and other legal notices that may appear in the\r\n     Software.

You agree that AMD may disclose such\r\n   feedback, suggestions or opinions to any third party in any manner,\r\n   and You agree that AMD has the ability to sublicense any of the\r\n   foregoing rights in any feedback, suggestions or opinions or AMD\r\n   products or services in any form to any third party without\r\n   restriction.\r\n\r\n3. OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT OF MATERIALS:\r\n\r\n   You agree that the Materials are owned by AMD and\/or AMD’s\r\n   licensors (if any), and are protected by United States and foreign\r\n   intellectual property laws (e.g. patent and copyright laws) and\r\n   international treaty provisions.  You will not remove the copyright\r\n   notice from the Materials.  You agree to prevent any unauthorized\r\n   copying of the Materials.  All title and copyrights in and to the\r\n   Materials, all copies thereof (in whole or in part, and in any\r\n   form), and all rights therein shall remain vested in AMD.  Except\r\n   as expressly provided herein, AMD does not grant any express or\r\n   implied right to You under AMD patents, copyrights, trademarks, or\r\n   trade secret information and such rights are reserved to AMD and\/or\r\n   its licensors.\r\n\r\n4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER:\r\n\r\n   THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\r\n   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n   NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TITLE, OR\r\n   FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THOSE ARISING FROM CUSTOM OF\r\n   TRADE OR COURSE OF USAGE.\r\n\r\n   FOR CLARIFICATION, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR\r\n   PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIALS REMAINS WITH YOU.  AMD DOES NOT\r\n   WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE\r\n   CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, QUALITY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE\r\n   MATERIALS.  AMD DOES NOT WARRANT THAT OPERATION OF THE MATERIALS\r\n   WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR\r\n   DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING THE SOFTWARE AND ASSUME\r\n   ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT\r\n   NOT LIMITED TO THE RISKS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF\r\n   DATA, PROGRAMS OR EQUIPMENT, AND UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF\r\n   OPERATIONS.  Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion or\r\n   limitation of implied warranties, so the above limitations or\r\n   exclusions may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:\r\n\r\n   IN NO EVENT SHALL AMD OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND\r\n   AGENTS, ITS SUPPLIERS OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY\r\n   THIRD PARTIES IN RECEIPT OF THE MATERIALS UNDER ANY THEORY OF\r\n   LIABILITY, WHETHER EQUITABLE, LEGAL OR COMMON LAW ACTION ARISING\r\n   HEREUNDER FOR CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, TORT\r\n   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE FOR DAMAGES WHICH, IN THE\r\n   AGGREGATE EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10.00).  IN NO EVENT SHALL AMD BE\r\n   LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL\r\n   DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS\r\n   INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF INFORMATION ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR\r\n   INABILITY TO USE THE MATERIALS, EVEN IF AMD HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\n   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  BY USING THE MATERIALS WITHOUT\r\n   CHARGE, YOU ACCEPT THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK.  Because some\r\n   jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for\r\n   consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not\r\n   apply to You.\r\n\r\n6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS:\r\n\r\n   You shall adhere to all applicable U.S., European, and other export\r\n   laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration\r\n   Regulations (“EAR”), (15 C.F.R.

Council Regulation (EC) No 1334\/2000 of 22 June 2000.\r\n   Further, pursuant to Section 740.6 of the EAR, You hereby certify\r\n   that, except pursuant to a license granted by the United States\r\n   Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security or as\r\n   otherwise permitted pursuant to a License Exception under the EAR,\r\n   You will not (1) export, re-export or release to a national of a\r\n   country in Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 any restricted\r\n   technology, software, or source code it receives from AMD, or (2)\r\n   export to Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 the direct product of such\r\n   technology or software, if such foreign produced direct product is\r\n   subject to national security controls as identified on the Commerce\r\n   Control List (currently found in Supplement 1 to Part 774 of\r\n   EAR). For the most current Country Group listings, or for\r\n   additional information about the EAR or Your obligations under\r\n   those regulations, please refer to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and\r\n   Security’s website at http:\/\/www.bis.doc.gov\/.\r\n\r\n7.

Use of the Materials by the Government\r\n   constitutes acknowledgment of AMD’s proprietary rights in them.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION OF LICENSE:\r\n\r\n   This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from AMD\r\n   or judicial resolution if You fail to comply with any provisions of\r\n   this Agreement.

Each party hereto submits to the jurisdiction of\r\n   the state and federal courts of Santa Clara County and the Northern\r\n   District of California for the purposes of all legal proceedings\r\n   arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the subject matter\r\n   hereof.  Each party waives any objection which it may have to\r\n   contest such forum.\r\n\r\n11. SEVERABILITY:\r\n\r\n   Should any term of this Agreement be declared void or unenforceable\r\n   by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall have\r\n   no effect on the remaining terms hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. NO WAIVER:\r\n\r\n   The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder\r\n   or to take action against the other party in the event of any\r\n   breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to\r\n   subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event\r\n   of future breaches.\r\n\r\n13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT:\r\n\r\n   This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\n   and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous oral or written\r\n   agreements with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement","risk":4,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f6126a48-bb2e-4481-badf-5f5f780bbd6e"}
