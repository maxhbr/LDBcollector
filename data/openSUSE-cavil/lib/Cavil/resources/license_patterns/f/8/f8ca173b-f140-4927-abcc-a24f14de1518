The intent is that anyone\r\ncan do anything with the code, but that I do not assume any liability, nor\r\nexpress any warranty for this code.  <p>\r\n\r\nAs of Shapelib 1.2.6 the core portions of the library are made available\r\nunder two possible licenses.  The licensee can choose to use the code\r\nunder either the Library GNU Public License (LGPL) described in \r\nCOPYING or under the following MIT style license.  Any files in\r\nthe Shapelib distribution without explicit copyright license terms\r\n(such as this documentation, the Makefile and so forth) should be\r\nconsidered to have the following licensing terms.  Some auxilary portions\r\nof Shapelib, notably some of the components in the contrib directory\r\ncome under slightly different license restrictions.  Check the source\r\nfiles that you are actually using for conditions.<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Default License Terms<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<quote>\r\nCopyright (c) 1999, Frank Warmerdam<p>\r\n\r\nThis software is available under the following \"MIT Style\" license,\r\nor at the option of the licensee under the LGPL (see COPYING).  This\r\noption is discussed in more detail in shapelib.html.<p>\r\n \r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\nand\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<p>\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\r\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<p>\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Unless\r\nthe submissions indicate otherwise I will assume that changes submitted to\r\nme remain under the the above \"dual license\" terms.  If changes are made\r\nto the library with the intention that those changes should be protected by\r\nthe LGPL then I should be informed upon submission.  Note that I will not\r\ngenerally incorporate changes into the core of Shapelib that are protected \r\nunder the LGPL as this would effectively limit the whole file and \r\ndistribution to LGPL terms.<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Opting for LGPL<\/h3>\r\n\r\nFor licensee's opting to use Shapelib under LGPL as opposed to the MIT\r\nStyle license above, and wishing to redistribute the software based on \r\nShapelib, I would ask that all \"dual license\" modules be updated to\r\nindicate that only the LGPL (and not the MIT Style license) applies.  This\r\naction represents opting for the LGPL, and thereafter LGPL terms apply to\r\nany redistribution and modification of the affected modules","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later OR MIT","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f8ca173b-f140-4927-abcc-a24f14de1518"}
