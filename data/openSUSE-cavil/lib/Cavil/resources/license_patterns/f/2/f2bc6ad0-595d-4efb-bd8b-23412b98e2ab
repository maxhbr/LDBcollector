ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION \r\nOF THE LICENSED WORK CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS \r\nLICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE \r\nTERMS OF THIS LICENSE. \"LICENSED WORK\" AND \"RECIPIENT\" ARE \r\nDEFINED BELOW.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This License is \"adaptive\", and the generic version or another \r\nversion of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine your rights \r\nand obligations under this License. You must read the specific Adaptive Public License \r\nthat you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain terms are defined at the outset by the \r\nInitial Contributor.\r\n\r\nSee Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying this \r\nLicense to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this License. For \r\nexample, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of law and jurisdiction \r\nsee Part 3 of Exhibit A; (b) for the selected definition of Third Party see Part 4 of Exhibit \r\nA; and (c) for selected patent licensing terms (if any) see Section 2.2 below and Part 6 of \r\nExhibit A.\r\n\r\n1.

In \r\naddition, a module does not qualify as an Independent Module but instead forms part of \r\nthe Licensed Work if the module: (a) is embedded in the Licensed Work; (b) is included \r\nby reference in the Licensed Work other than by a function call or a class reference; or \r\n(c) must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file directory or \r\nsubdirectory actually containing files making up the Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n 1.8. \"INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR\" means the Person or entity identified as the Initial \r\nContributor in the notice required by Part 1 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n 1.9. \"INITIAL WORK\" means the initial Source Code, object code (if any) and \r\ndocumentation for the computer program identified in Part 2 of Exhibit A, as such Source \r\nCode, object code and documentation is distributed under this License by the Initial \r\nContributor.\r\n\r\n 1.10. \"LARGER WORK\" means a work that combines the Licensed Work or portions \r\nthereof with code not governed by this License.\r\n\r\n 1.11. \"LICENSED WORK\" means the Initial Work and\/or any Subsequent Work, in \r\neach case including portions thereof.\r\n\r\n 1.12. \"LICENSE NOTICE\" has the meaning assigned in Part 5 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n 1.13. \"MODIFICATION\" or \"MODIFICATIONS\" means any change to and\/or addition \r\nto the Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n 1.14. \"PERSON\" means an individual or other legal entity, including a corporation, \r\npartnership or other body.\r\n\r\n 1.15. \"RECIPIENT\" means any Person who receives or obtains the Licensed Work \r\nunder this License (by way of example, without limiting the foregoing, any Subsequent \r\nContributor or Distributor).\r\n\r\n 1.16. \"SOURCE CODE\" means the source code for a computer program, including the \r\nsource code for all modules and components of the computer program, plus any \r\nassociated interface definition files, and scripts used to control compilation and \r\ninstallation of an executable.\r\n\r\n 1.17. \"SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR\" means any Person that makes or contributes \r\nto the making of any Subsequent Work and that distributes that Subsequent Work to at \r\nleast one Third Party.\r\n\r\n 1.18. \"SUBSEQUENT WORK\" means a work that has resulted or arises from changes to \r\nand\/or additions to:\r\n\r\n (a) the Initial Work;\r\n\r\n (b) any other Subsequent Work; or\r\n\r\n (c) to any combination of the Initial Work and any such other Subsequent Work;\r\n\r\n where such changes and\/or additions originate from a Subsequent Contributor. A \r\nSubsequent Work will \"originate\" from a Subsequent Contributor if the Subsequent Work \r\nwas a result of efforts by such Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such \r\nSubsequent Contributor's behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is engaged by \r\nor under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For greater certainty, a Subsequent \r\nWork expressly excludes and shall not capture within its meaning any Independent \r\nModule.\r\n\r\n 1.19. \"SUPPLEMENT FILE\" means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a \r\nfile name \"suppfile.txt\".\r\n\r\n 1.20. \"THIRD PARTY\" has the meaning assigned in Part 4 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n2. LICENSE.\r\n\r\n 2.1. COPYRIGHT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT \r\nCONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\n (a) Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby grants each \r\nRecipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\r\n\r\n (i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute \r\nand sublicense the Initial Work; and\r\n\r\n (ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any \r\nderivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\r\n\r\n in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified \r\nbasis, or as part of a Larger Work.\r\n\r\n (b) Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor hereby grants each \r\nRecipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\r\n\r\n (i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute \r\nand sublicense the Subsequent Work of such Subsequent Contributor; and\r\n\r\n (ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any \r\nderivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\r\n\r\n in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified \r\nbasis, or as part of a Larger Work.\r\n\r\n 2.2. PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\n (a) This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial \r\nContributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial \r\nWork is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the \r\nInitial Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in \r\nparagraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this is not done then the Initial \r\nWork and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any \r\npatent license (the \"PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE\").\r\n\r\n (b) However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as \r\nthe case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work \r\ndistributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion \r\nthereof) and\/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a \r\nLicense which includes a patent license (the \"PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE\") by \r\nselecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E \r\nfrom Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as \r\nthe case may be) such future copies under this License.\r\n\r\n (c) If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any \r\nother portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing \r\nof such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E \r\nfrom Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-\r\nExcluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more \r\ncopies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the \r\nLicense which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with \r\nrespect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and \r\ndistribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such \r\ncopies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license.\r\n\r\n (d) Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work \r\n(or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded \r\nLicense with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of \r\nthe License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) \r\nshall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the \r\ncombination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the \r\nPatents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E \r\nfrom Part 6 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n 2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent \r\nContributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, \r\nwarranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent \r\nContributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other \r\nintellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent \r\nContributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought \r\nby any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in \r\nrelation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses \r\ngranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other \r\nintellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing \r\ndisclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the \r\nLicensed Work, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing \r\nthe Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n 2.4. RESERVATION.\r\n\r\n Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, \r\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent \r\nContributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein.\r\n\r\n3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\r\n\r\n 3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n (a) A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent \r\nWork(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of \r\nat least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a \r\nreasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) \r\ndays after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work.\r\n\r\n (b) All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of \r\nthe License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit \r\nA and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work \r\ndistributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed \r\nWork in a file called \"license.txt.\" In addition, the License Notice in Part 5 of Exhibit A \r\nmust be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any \r\nexecutable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any \r\nparty using the Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n 3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.\r\n\r\n A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in \r\nExecutable form (an \"EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION\") to any third party, under the \r\nterms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available \r\nunder and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the \r\nfollowing conditions is fulfilled:\r\n\r\n (a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the \r\nLicensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be \r\ndistributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic \r\nDistribution Mechanism; or\r\n\r\n (b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at \r\nleast thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a \r\ncharge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \r\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the \r\nExecutable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution \r\nMechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code \r\nform to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement \r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn \r\nto as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.\r\n\r\n For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or \r\nportion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such \r\ndistribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, \r\nor in some other combination.\r\n\r\n 3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\n When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any \r\nPerson in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of \r\nthis License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the \r\ncopy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater \r\nclarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any \r\nSource Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a \r\ncopy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source \r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n 3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.\r\n\r\n Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is \r\nincluded in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that \r\nparticular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. \r\nIf it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, \r\nthen the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant \r\ndirectory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a \r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n 3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED \r\nMODIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own \r\ncorporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and \r\nSubsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient's own \r\ncorporation or organization (collectively, \"INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS\"). The \r\nRecipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable \r\nform, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such \r\ninternal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use \r\nModifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed \r\npursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to \r\ndistribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient \r\nshall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications \r\ndistributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that \r\nSubsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the \r\nLicensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in \r\naccordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.\r\n\r\n 3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES.\r\n\r\nThis License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, \r\nSubsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules \r\nmay be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements.\r\n\r\n 3.7. LARGER WORKS.\r\n\r\nAny Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining \r\nany of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and \r\nmay distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, \r\nDistributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this \r\nLicense are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.\r\n\r\n 3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\n (a) Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial \r\nContributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent \r\nWork created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file \r\ndocumenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the \r\nSupplement File, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution \r\nto that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in \r\nPart 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors \r\nto document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works.\r\n\r\n (b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change \r\nearlier requirements (in each case, the \"EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") \r\nfor documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy \r\nof the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the \r\nLicensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the \"NEW \r\nDESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting such changes.\r\n\r\n (c) Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent \r\nWork under a copy of this License (in each case, an \"Earlier LICENSED COPY\") having \r\nthe Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier \r\nLicensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New \r\nDescription Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New \r\nDescription Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of \r\nany such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled Part \r\n1 that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements.\r\n\r\n (d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a \r\nmechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they \r\nmake to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement \r\nFile shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of \r\nthis License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any \r\nRecipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a \r\nRecipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply \r\nwith Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any \r\nSupplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent \r\nPart 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any \r\nSubsequent Work.\r\n\r\n (e) An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions \r\nmade by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is \r\na sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs \r\nof this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part \r\n1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this \r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n 3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.\r\n\r\n The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or \r\npromote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior \r\nwritten permission.\r\n\r\n 3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\n (a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional \r\nvalue may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the \r\nInitial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each \r\ntime an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a \r\nprogram dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial \r\nContributor's attribution information must occur (the \"ATTRIBUTION \r\nINFORMATION\"). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of \r\neach Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the \r\nSupplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable \r\nprogram resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program \r\ndependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore \r\nthe Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the \r\nfollowing Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial \r\nContributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or \r\ngraphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \r\n\"ATTRIBUTION LIMITS\").\r\n\r\n (b) If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in Part 2 of the \r\nSupplement File, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution \r\nInformation of the Initial Contributor.\r\n\r\n (c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and\/or trade names \r\ncontained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are \r\nthe exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the \r\npermission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, \r\nor as expressly set out in this License.\r\n\r\n 3.11. For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a \r\nSupplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution \r\nrequirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise \r\npurports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation \r\ncontained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.\r\n\r\n 4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES.\r\n\r\n A Recipient (\"COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT\") may choose to offer, and to charge a fee \r\nfor, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, \"SERVICES\") to \r\none or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may \r\ndo so only on that Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other \r\nDistributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such \r\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is\/are offered by Commercial \r\nRecipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any \r\nparty the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any \r\nof the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish \r\nany of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the \r\nCommercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in \r\nSource Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the \r\nright to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or \r\nExecutable distribution (as the case may be)).\r\n\r\n 4.2. INDEMNITY.\r\n\r\n Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to \r\nend users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the \r\ncommercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed \r\nWork in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create \r\npotential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed \r\nWork in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor \r\n(\"COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other \r\nDistributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an \"INDEMNIFIED PARTY\") \r\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"LOSSES\") arising from claims, \r\nlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to \r\nthe extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection \r\nwith its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in \r\nconnection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims \r\nor Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to \r\nqualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in \r\nwriting of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-\r\noperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement \r\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own \r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\r\n\r\n 5.1. NEW VERSIONS.\r\n\r\n The Initial Contributor may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from \r\ntime to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n 5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.\r\n\r\n Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor \r\nunder a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it \r\nunder the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed \r\nWork under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial \r\nContributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with \r\nthe terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation \r\nof derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and \r\nsublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than \r\nthe Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\n 6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK \r\nIS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY \r\nREPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION \r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT \r\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-\r\nINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF \r\nTHE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK \r\nPROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL \r\nCONTRIBUTOR OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST \r\nOF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE \r\nCONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY \r\nLICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS \r\nLICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n 6.2. RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS.\r\n\r\n Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and \r\ndistributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights \r\nunder this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, \r\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and \r\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n7. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n 7.1. This License shall continue until terminated in accordance with the express terms \r\nherein.\r\n\r\n 7.2. Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time.\r\n\r\n 7.3. This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to a \r\nparticular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is in material breach \r\nof any of the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days of \r\nbecoming aware of the breach. Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by \r\nsuch Recipient of any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted \r\nany rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this License.\r\n\r\n 7.4. Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient for any \r\nreason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other License to that Recipient shall \r\nterminate. However, all sublicenses to the Licensed Work which were previously \r\nproperly granted by such Recipient under a copy of this License (in each case, an \"Other \r\nLicense\" and in plural, \"Other Licenses\") shall survive any such termination of this \r\nLicense, including without limitation the rights and obligations under such Other \r\nLicenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for \r\nso long as the respective sublicensees (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with \r\nthe terms of the copy of this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the \r\nLicensed Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their \r\nrespective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in \r\neffect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n 7.5. Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient, \r\nSections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together with all provisions of this \r\nLicense necessary for the interpretation and enforcement of same, shall expressly survive \r\nsuch termination.\r\n\r\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\n 8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS \r\nSUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE \r\nOFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND\/OR AGENTS (AS THE CASE MAY \r\nBE), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, INDIRECT \r\nDAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL \r\nDAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY \r\nOTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS \r\nOF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, OR ANY OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN \r\nANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, \r\nPERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK OR ANY \r\nPART THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT \r\nSERVICES, OR THAT RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS \r\nIN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF \r\nPERFORMANCE), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, \r\nWHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING \r\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) IN RELATION TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY \r\nOUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED \r\nWORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF \r\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF \r\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL \r\nINJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT \r\nAPPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. THIS CLAUSE \r\nCONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY \r\nLICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS \r\nLICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH \r\nIN THIS SECTION 8.1.\r\n\r\n 8.2. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, EACH RECIPIENT \r\nSHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, OR \r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST \r\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, \r\nWHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING \r\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR \r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS \r\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH \r\nDAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO \r\nLIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH \r\nPARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH \r\nLIMITATION.\r\n\r\n9. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL ACTION.\r\n\r\n 9.1. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the \r\nGoverning Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, without regard to its conflict of \r\nlaw provisions. No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year \r\nafter the cause of the action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in \r\nany litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing Jurisdiction is not \r\nassigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing Jurisdiction shall be the State of New \r\nYork.\r\n\r\n 9.2. The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not exclusive \r\njurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and claims, whether for specific \r\nperformance, injunction, damages or otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of \r\nor in any way relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality, validity, \r\nexistence and enforceability of this License. Each party to this License hereby \r\nirrevocably attorns to and accepts the jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing \r\nJurisdiction for such purposes.\r\n\r\n 9.3. Except as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, in the event of any action or \r\nproceeding brought by any party against another under this License the prevailing party \r\nshall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in \r\nsuch action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable.\r\n\r\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n 10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the benefit of the Initial \r\nContributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the \r\nInitial Contributor and\/or any other Recipient may enforce the terms and conditions of \r\nthis License against any Recipient.\r\n\r\n 10.2. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof, \r\nand supersedes and cancels all previous oral and written communications, \r\nrepresentations, agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the \r\nsubject matter hereof.\r\n\r\n 10.3. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the \r\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n 10.4. The language in all parts of this License shall be in all cases construed simply \r\naccording to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any \r\nlaw or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed \r\nagainst the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n 10.5. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under the laws of the \r\nGoverning Jurisdiction, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder \r\nof the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such \r\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision \r\nvalid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n 10.6. The paragraph headings of this License are for reference and convenience only and \r\nare not a part of this License, and they shall have no effect upon the construction or \r\ninterpretation of any part hereof.\r\n\r\n 10.7. Each of the terms \"including\", \"include\" and \"includes\", when used in this License, \r\nis not limiting whether or not non-limiting language (such as \"without limitation\" or \"but \r\nnot limited to\" or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto.\r\n\r\n 10.8. The parties hereto acknowledge they have expressly required that this License and \r\nnotices relating thereto be drafted in the English language.\r\n\r\n\/\/***THE LICENSE TERMS END HERE (OTHER THAN AS SET OUT IN EXHIBIT \r\n\/\/A).***\/\/\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A (to the Adaptive Public License)\r\n\r\n PART 1: INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR AND DESIGNATED WEB SITE The Initial \r\nContributor is: \tMusicIP Corporation (www.musicip.com)\r\n\r\nAddress of Initial Contributor: \t\r\n\r\n605 E.

The \r\ntermination shall be effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from User to \r\nRecipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent litigation claim before the end of the \r\nninety (90) day period. To be effective, any such notice of license termination must \r\ninclude a specific list of applicable patents and\/or a copy of the copyrighted work of User \r\nthat User alleges will be infringed by Recipient upon License termination. License \r\ntermination is only effective with respect to patents and\/or copyrights for which proper \r\nnotice has been given.\r\n\r\n PART 7: SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED \r\nMODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial \r\nContributor qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) is invited (but not required) to cause \r\neach Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to \r\ncontain a file documenting the changes such Subsequent Contributor made to create that \r\nSubsequent Work and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n\/\/***EXHIBIT A ENDS HERE.***\/\/ \r\n\r\n-- with the following supplement --\r\n\r\nSupplemental Text file for Open Fingerprint Architecture library (LIBOFA) distributed \r\nunder Adaptive Public License 1.0\r\n\r\nPer Section 3.10, LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR\r\n\r\n(a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional \r\nvalue may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the \r\nInitial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each \r\ntime an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a \r\nprogram dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial \r\nContributor's attribution information must occur (the \"ATTRIBUTION \r\nINFORMATION\"). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of \r\neach Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the \r\nSupplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable \r\nprogram resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program \r\ndependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore \r\nthe Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the \r\nfollowing Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial \r\nContributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or \r\ngraphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \r\n\"ATTRIBUTION LIMITS\").\r\n\r\nThe attribution requested by MusicIP for this source code is:\r\n(c) a digital imageconnected_by_musicip.gif  or connected_by_musicip.png included \r\nwith this source code, also available from \r\nhttp:\/\/www.musicip.com\/connected_by_musicip.gif or \r\nhttp:\/\/www.musicip.com\/connected_by_musicip.png\r\n\r\n(d) a URL.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\f\r\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\f\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\f\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\f\r\n  8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\f\r\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs.
