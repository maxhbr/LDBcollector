The foregoing limitations will\n    apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential\n    purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or\n    consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be\n    applicable to you.\n\n9.  THIRD PARTY CODE.

This\n    Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to\n    its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous\n    oral or written communications, proposals, representations and\n    warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms\n    of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication\n    between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term\n    of this Agreement.
