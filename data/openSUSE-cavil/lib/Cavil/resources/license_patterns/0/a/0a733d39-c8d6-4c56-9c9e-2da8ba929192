By contrast, the GNU\nGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to\nmake sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to\nsurrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all\nthe rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no\nwarranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the\noriginal authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors\nof a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it\nmay be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to\nsay, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into\nanother language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee\nis addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its\nscope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\nthat you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of\nwarranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\nin exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,\nand copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\nof these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\n    any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the\n    Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n    License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running\n    for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n    copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\n    users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based\n    on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\nthe Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its\nterms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\nsections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\nregardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;\nrather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the\nProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the\n    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\n    than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\n    source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\n    interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This\n    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or\n    executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,\ncomplete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\nruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\nhave their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\npermission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or\nmodifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You\nmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited\nto patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as\nto satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\nsection is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to\ncontest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\nthe wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\ncannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not\nthus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to\ntime. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which\napplies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are\ndifferent, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided\nby the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\nreuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\nOF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\nOR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY\nWHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\nthis is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to\nmost effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\nfor details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of\ncourse, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks\nor menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright\ndisclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\nby James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a\nsubroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
