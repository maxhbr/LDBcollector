By contrast, the GNU General Public\n      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. \n      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the \n      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \n      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you \n      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free \n      programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n      specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n      Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n      can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n      this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n      strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n      not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n      you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n      for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n      it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n      it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n      these things.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n      distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n      rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n      you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n      you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n      code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n      it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n      library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n      permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n      there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n      modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n      that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n      author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n      introduced by others.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n      any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n      restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n      ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n      General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n      is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n      this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n      libraries into non-free programs.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n      combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n      entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n      Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n      the library.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n      does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n      Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n      of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n      are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n      libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n      special circumstances.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n      a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n      allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n      library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n      case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n      software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n      free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n      system.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n      users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n      that program using a modified version of the Library.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n      modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n      \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n      former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n      be combined with the library in order to run","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"0c0d33ae-b205-4a83-91be-aa20dc090f74"}
