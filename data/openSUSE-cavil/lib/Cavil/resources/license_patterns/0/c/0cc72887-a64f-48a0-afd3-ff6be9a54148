PREAMBLE<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\r\n  * written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone\r\n  * the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\r\n  * modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,\r\n  * this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\r\n  * credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\r\n  * modifications made by others.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\r\n  * works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\r\n  * complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\r\n  * license designed for free software.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\n  * software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\r\n  * program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\r\n  * software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\r\n  * it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\r\n  * whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\r\n  * principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\r\n  * notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\r\n  * under the terms of this License.  The \"Document\", below, refers to any\r\n  * such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\r\n  * addressed as \"you\".\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\r\n  * Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\r\n  * modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\r\n  * the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\r\n  * publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\r\n  * (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\r\n  * within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\r\n  * textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\r\n  * mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\r\n  * connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\r\n  * commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\r\n  * them.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\r\n  * are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\r\n  * that says that the Document is released under this License.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\r\n  * as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\r\n  * the Document is released under this License.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\n  * represented in a format whose specification is available to the\r\n  * general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\r\n  * straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\r\n  * pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\r\n  * drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\r\n  * for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\r\n  * to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\r\n  * format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\r\n  * subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\r\n  * not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\r\n  * ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\r\n  * or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\r\n  * HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\r\n  * PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\r\n  * by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\r\n  * processing tools are not generally available, and the\r\n  * machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\r\n  * purposes only.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\r\n  * plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\r\n  * this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\r\n  * formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\r\n  * the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\r\n  * preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>2. VERBATIM COPYING<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\r\n  * commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\r\n  * copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\r\n  * to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\r\n  * conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\r\n  * technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\r\n  * copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\r\n  * compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\r\n  * number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\r\n  * you may publicly display copies.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\r\n  * and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\r\n  * the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\r\n  * Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\r\n  * the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\r\n  * you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\r\n  * the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\r\n  * visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\r\n  * Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\r\n  * the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\r\n  * as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\n  * legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\n  * reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\r\n  * pages.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\r\n  * more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\r\n  * copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\r\n  * a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\r\n  * Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\r\n  * general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\r\n  * charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\r\n  * option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\r\n  * distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\r\n  * Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\r\n  * until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\r\n  * copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\r\n  * the public.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\r\n  * Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\r\n  * them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>4. MODIFICATIONS<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\r\n  * the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\r\n  * the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\r\n  * Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\r\n  * and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\r\n  * of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * <ul>\r\n  * <li><strong>A.<\/strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\r\n  *    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\r\n  *    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\r\n  *    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\r\n  *    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n  * <li><strong>B.<\/strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\r\n  *    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\r\n  *    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\r\n  *    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\r\n  * <li><strong>C.<\/strong> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\r\n  *    Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\n  * <li><strong>D.<\/strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n  * <li><strong>E.<\/strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\r\n  *    adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\n  * <li><strong>F.<\/strong> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\n  *    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\r\n  *    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n  * <li><strong>G.<\/strong> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\r\n  *    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\n  * <li><strong>H.<\/strong> Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n  * <li><strong>I.<\/strong> Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to\r\n  *    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\r\n  *    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\r\n  *    there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\r\n  *    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\r\n  *    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\r\n  *    Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n  * <li><strong>J.<\/strong> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\r\n  *    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\r\n  *    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\r\n  *    it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\r\n  *    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\r\n  *    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\r\n  *    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n  * <li><strong>K.<\/strong> In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\r\n  *    preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\r\n  *    substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\r\n  *    and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n  * <li><strong>L.<\/strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\r\n  *    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\r\n  *    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n  * <li><strong>M.<\/strong> Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\r\n  *    may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\n  * <li><strong>N.<\/strong> Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\"\r\n  *    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\n  * <\/ul>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\r\n  * appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\r\n  * copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\r\n  * of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\r\n  * list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\r\n  * These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\r\n  * nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\r\n  * parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\r\n  * been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\r\n  * standard.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\r\n  * passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\r\n  * of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\r\n  * Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\r\n  * through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\r\n  * includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\r\n  * by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\r\n  * you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\r\n  * permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\r\n  * give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\r\n  * imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\n  * License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\r\n  * versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\r\n  * Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\r\n  * list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\r\n  * license notice.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\n  * multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\n  * copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\r\n  * different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\r\n  * adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\r\n  * author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\r\n  * Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\r\n  * Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\"\r\n  * in the various original documents, forming one section entitled\r\n  * \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\r\n  * and any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\r\n  * entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\n  * released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\n  * License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\r\n  * the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\r\n  * verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\r\n  * it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\r\n  * License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\r\n  * other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\r\n  * and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\n  * distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\r\n  * of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\r\n  * compilation.  Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this\r\n  * License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\r\n  * with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\r\n  * are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\r\n  * copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\r\n  * of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\r\n  * covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\r\n  * Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>8. TRANSLATION<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\r\n  * distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\r\n  * Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\r\n  * permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\r\n  * translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\r\n  * original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\r\n  * translation of this License provided that you also include the\r\n  * original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement\r\n  * between the translation and the original English version of this\r\n  * License, the original English version will prevail.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>9. TERMINATION<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\r\n  * as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\r\n  * copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\r\n  * automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\r\n  * parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\r\n  * License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\n  * parties remain in full compliance.\r\n  * <p>\r\n  *\r\n  * <strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<\/strong>\r\n  * <p>\r\n  * The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\r\n  * of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\r\n  * versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\n  * differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
