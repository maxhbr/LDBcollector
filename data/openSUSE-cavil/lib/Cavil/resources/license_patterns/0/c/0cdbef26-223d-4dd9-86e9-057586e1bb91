See the full text of the licence in the\nCOPYING file for precise details.)\n\nThe core source code of libpipeline is licensed under GPL v2 or later.\nHowever, libpipeline incorporates parts of the Gnulib portability library,\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation and others, and much of Gnulib\nis distributed under GPL v3 or later.  This means that libpipeline as a\nwhole falls under the terms of the GPL v3 or later.  Unless you take special\npains to remove the GPL v3 portions, you must therefore follow the terms and\nconditions of the GPL v3 or later when distributing libpipeline itself, or\ndistributing code linked against it.\n\nNote that this does not require that your own source code be licensed under\nthe GPL v3, contrary to popular misunderstanding.  However, you must be\nprepared to distribute your work as a whole under the terms of the GPL v3 or\nlater, which requires that your licence be compatible with the GPL v3.  See\nhttp:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses if you\nneed advice on compatibility.\n\nThe GPL mainly restricts distribution (\"conveying\", in the specific language\nof GPL v3), and is careful not to restrict private use.  Therefore, you may\nwrite programs for your own use that use libpipeline without needing to\nlicense them under GPL v3-compatible terms.  If you distribute these\nprograms to others, then you must take care to use compatible licensing","risk":3,"spdx":"GPL-3.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"0cdbef26-223d-4dd9-86e9-057586e1bb91"}
