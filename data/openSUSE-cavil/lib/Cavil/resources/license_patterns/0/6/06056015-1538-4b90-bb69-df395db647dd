Furthermore, any\nobject code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the\nterms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions\nof subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the\nresulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I\nconsider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral\nequivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.

(This is merely an alternate way of specifying input\nto the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of\na running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or\noffer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The\nfact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file\nis, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation\nof the GPL.
