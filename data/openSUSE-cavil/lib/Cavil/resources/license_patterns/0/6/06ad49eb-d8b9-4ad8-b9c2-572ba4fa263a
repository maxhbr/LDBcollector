License Grants.\r\n\r\n  2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\r\n\r\n  Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\r\n  to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer\r\n  hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\r\n\r\n  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\r\n  trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,\r\n  modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\r\n  Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,\r\n  and\/or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n  (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of\r\n  Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and\r\n  offer for sale, and\/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software\r\n  (or portions thereof).\r\n\r\n  (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on\r\n  the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the\r\n  Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this\r\n  License.\r\n\r\n  (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\r\n  granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or\r\n  (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the\r\n  Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software\r\n  with other software or devices.\r\n\r\n  2.2. Contributor Grant.\r\n\r\n  Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\r\n  to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby\r\n  grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\r\n\r\n  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\r\n  trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,\r\n  display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\r\n  created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an\r\n  unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software\r\n  and\/or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n  (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\r\n  of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and\/or in\r\n  combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\r\n  combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or\r\n  otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\r\n  portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by\r\n  that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\r\n  combination).\r\n\r\n  (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\r\n  on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the\r\n  Modifications available to a third party.\r\n\r\n  (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\r\n  granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\r\n  Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third\r\n  party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination\r\n  of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software\r\n  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)\r\n  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\r\n  Modifications made by that Contributor.\r\n\r\n3. Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n  3.1. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\n  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\r\n  in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form\r\n  and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms\r\n  of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every\r\n  copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute\r\n  or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\r\n  Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\r\n  Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\r\n  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n\r\n  3.2. Modifications.\r\n\r\n  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\r\n  governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You\r\n  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and\/or You\r\n  have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n  3.3. Required Notices.\r\n\r\n  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\r\n  identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not\r\n  remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained\r\n  within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any\r\n  descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the\r\n  Initial Developer.\r\n\r\n  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\r\n  Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of\r\n  this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to\r\n  offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\r\n  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\r\n  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\r\n  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\r\n  absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\r\n  liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\r\n  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\r\n  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\r\n  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under\r\n  the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your\r\n  choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\r\n  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\r\n  and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\r\n  limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\r\n  the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered\r\n  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make\r\n  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\r\n  are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\r\n  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\r\n  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\r\n  Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n  3.6. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\r\n  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute\r\n  the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\r\n  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\r\n  Software.\r\n\r\n4. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n  4.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\n  Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and\/or\r\n  new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\r\n  given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section\r\n  4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\r\n  this License.\r\n\r\n  4.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\r\n  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\r\n  License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\r\n  the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\r\n  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\r\n  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\r\n  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\r\n  of the License under which You originally received the Covered\r\n  Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\r\n  otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\r\n  subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n  4.3. Modified Versions.\r\n\r\n  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\r\n  license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\r\n  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\r\n  remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\r\n  note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\r\n  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\r\n  License.\r\n\r\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\n  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\r\n  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE\r\n  IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\r\n  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\r\n  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\r\n  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\r\n  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\n  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\r\n  ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\r\n  AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n6. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\n  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\r\n  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\r\n  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\r\n  termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\r\n  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\r\n  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\r\n  assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\r\n  Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\r\n  Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\r\n  Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\r\n  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\r\n  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\r\n  Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\r\n  Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\r\n  from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\r\n  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\r\n  day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\r\n  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\r\n  a written agreement with Participant.\r\n\r\n  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\r\n  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\r\n  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\r\n  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\r\n  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\r\n  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\r\n  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\r\n  license.\r\n\r\n  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\r\n  all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\r\n  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\r\n  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\n  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\r\n  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\r\n  COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\r\n  TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\r\n  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\r\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\r\n  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\r\n  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\r\n  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\r\n  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\r\n  PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\r\n  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\r\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\r\n  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\n  The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\r\n  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\r\n  software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §\r\n  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\r\n  as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\r\n  with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\r\n  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\r\n  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\r\n  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\r\n  clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\r\n  software under this License.\r\n\r\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\r\n  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\n  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\r\n  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\r\n  the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\r\n  the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\r\n  provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\r\n  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\r\n  to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\r\n  venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\r\n  with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\r\n  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\r\n  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\r\n  the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\r\n  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\r\n  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\r\n  agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\r\n  States export administration regulations (and the export control\r\n  laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\r\n  or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\r\n\r\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\n  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\r\n  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\r\n  out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\r\n  work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\r\n  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\r\n  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\r\n\r\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\r\n\r\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\r\nState of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\r\nlitigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\r\nof the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\r\nstate courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\r\nCounty, California.\r\n\r\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\r\n\r\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\r\nBoston, MA 02110-1335\r\nUSA\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\r\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\r\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\r\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\r\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\r\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\r\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\r\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\r\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\r\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\r\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\r\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\r\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\r\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\r\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\r\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\r\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\r\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\r\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\r\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\r\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\r\nto any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\r\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\r\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\r\nverbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\r\n\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\r\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\r\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\r\nis true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\r\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\r\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\r\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\r\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\r\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\r\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\r\n    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\r\n    under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\r\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\r\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\r\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\r\n    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\r\n    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\r\n    is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\r\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\nthe Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\r\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\nscope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\r\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\r\n    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\r\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\r\n    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\r\n    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\r\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\r\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\r\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\r\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\r\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\r\nexecutable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\r\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\nthe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\r\ncode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\nalong with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\r\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\r\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\r\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\r\nfull compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\r\nits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\r\nProgram or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\r\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\r\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\r\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\r\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\r\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\r\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\ndistribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\r\nby public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\r\nthe author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\r\na consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\r\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\r\nFree Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\r\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\r\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\r\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\r\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\r\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\nAND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\r\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\r\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\r\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\r\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\r\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\r\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\r\n    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\r\n    General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\r\n    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\r\n    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\r\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\r\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\r\n    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\r\n    James Hacker.\r\n\r\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\r\nwith the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\r\nGeneral Public License instead of this License.\r\n\r\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\r\n\r\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and\/or its\r\naffiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\r\nexception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\r\nClasspath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\r\nwhere Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\r\nheader the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\r\nthe \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\r\nthat accompanied this code.\"\r\n\r\nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\r\nprograms in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\r\nunder licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\r\nFoundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\r\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\r\nlicensed to you under their original licenses.\r\n\r\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\r\nthe Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\r\npermits you to use that code in combination with other independent\r\nmodules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\r\nnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\r\nOracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\r\ncode into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\r\ndistributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\r\nClasspath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\r\ndistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\r\nall of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\r\nsince the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\r\nincluded in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\r\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\r\nfurther distribute the package.\r\n\r\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\r\nlawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\r\nException or making modifications to this package which may\r\nsubsequently be redistributed and\/or involve the use of third party\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\r\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\r\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\r\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\r\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\r\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\r\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\r\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\r\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\r\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\r\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\r\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\r\ndo so.
