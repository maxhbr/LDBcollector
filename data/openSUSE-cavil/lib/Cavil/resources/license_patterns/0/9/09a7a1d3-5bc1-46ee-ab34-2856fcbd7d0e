{"export_restricted":0,"license":"SUSE-Summary","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"All PulseAudio source files, except as noted below, are licensed under the GNU\r\nLesser General Public License. (see file LGPL for details)\r\n\r\nHowever, the server side has optional GPL dependencies.  These include the\r\nlibsamplerate and gdbm (core libraries), LIRC (lirc module) and FFTW (equalizer\r\nmodule), although others may also be included in the future.  If PulseAudio is\r\ncompiled with these optional components, this effectively downgrades the\r\nlicense of the server part to GPL (see the file GPL for details), exercising\r\nsection 3 of the LGPL.  In such circumstances, you should treat the client\r\nlibrary (libpulse) of PulseAudio as being LGPL licensed and the server part\r\n(libpulsecore) as being GPL licensed.  Since the PulseAudio daemon, tests,\r\nvarious utilities\/helpers and the modules link to libpulsecore and\/or the afore\r\nmentioned optional GPL dependencies they are of course also GPL licensed also\r\nin this scenario.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, if D-Bus support is enabled, the PulseAudio client library\r\n(libpulse) MAY need to be licensed under the GPL, depending on the license\r\nadopted for libdbus. libdbus is licensed under either of the Academic Free\r\nLicense 2.1 or GPL 2.0 or above. Which of these applies is your choice, and the\r\nresult affects the licensing of libpulse and thus, potentially, all programs\r\nthat link to libpulse.\r\n\r\nAndre Adrian's echo cancellation implementation is licensed under a less\r\nrestrictive license - see src\/modules\/echo-cancel\/adrian-license.txt for\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nSome other files pulled into PA source (i.e. reference implementations that are\r\nconsidered too small and stable to be considered as an external library) use the\r\nmore permissive MIT license. These include the device reservation DBus protocol\r\nand realtime kit implementations.\r\n\r\nA more permissive BSD-style license is used for LFE filters, see\r\nsrc\/pulsecore\/filter\/LICENSE.WEBKIT for details.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a more permissive Sun license is used for code that performs\r\nu-law, A-law and linear PCM conversions.\r\n\r\nWhile we attempt to provide a summary here, it is the ultimate responsibility of\r\nthe packager to ensure the components they use in their build of PulseAudio\r\nmeets their license requirements","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"09a7a1d3-5bc1-46ee-ab34-2856fcbd7d0e"}
