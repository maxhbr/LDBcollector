{"export_restricted":0,"license":"SUSE-Public-Domain","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Copyright Release for\r\nContributions To SQLite\r\nSQLite is software that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. SQLite is available for free download from\r\nhttp:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/. The principal author and maintainer of SQLite has disclaimed all copyright interest in his\r\ncontributions to SQLite and thus released his contributions into the public domain. In order to keep the SQLite software\r\nunencumbered by copyright claims, the principal author asks others who may from time to time contribute changes and\r\nenhancements to likewise disclaim their own individual copyright interest.\r\nBecause the SQLite software found at http:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/ is in the public domain, anyone is free to download the \r\nSQLite\r\nsoftware from that website, make changes to the software, use, distribute, or sell the modified software, under either \r\nthe\r\noriginal name or under some new name, without any need to obtain permission, pay royalties, acknowledge the original\r\nsource of the software, or in any other way compensate, identify, or notify the original authors. Nobody is in any way\r\ncompelled to contribute their SQLite changes and enhancements back to the SQLite website. This document concerns only\r\nchanges and enhancements to SQLite that are intentionally and deliberately contributed back to the SQLite website.\r\nFor the purposes of this document, \"SQLite software\" shall mean any computer source code, documentation, makefiles, \r\ntest\r\nscripts, or other information that is published on the SQLite website, http:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/. Precompiled binaries \r\nare\r\nexcluded from the definition of \"SQLite software\" in this document because the process of compiling the software may\r\nintroduce information from outside sources which is not properly a part of SQLite.\r\nThe header comments on the SQLite source files exhort the reader to share freely and to never take more than one gives. \r\nIn\r\nthe spirit of that exhortation I make the following declarations:\r\n1. I dedicate to the public domain any and all copyright interest in the SQLite software that was publicly available \r\non the\r\nSQLite website (http:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/) prior to the date of the signature below and any changes or enhancements to\r\nthe SQLite software that I may cause to be published on that website in the future. I make this dedication for the\r\nbenefit of the public at large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors. I intend this dedication to be an overt \r\nact\r\nof relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to the SQLite software under copyright law.\r\n2. To the best of my knowledge and belief, the changes and enhancements that I have contributed to SQLite are either\r\noriginally written by me or are derived from prior works which I have verified are also in the public domain and are\r\nnot subject to claims of copyright by other parties.\r\n3. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no individual, business, organization, government, or other entity has any\r\ncopyright interest in the SQLite software as it existed on the SQLite website as of the date on the signature line below.\r\n4. I agree never to publish any additional information to the SQLite website (by CVS, email, scp, FTP, or any other\r\nmeans) unless that information is an original work of authorship by me or is derived from prior published versions of\r\nSQLite. I agree never to copy and paste code into the SQLite code base from other sources. I agree never to publish \r\non\r\nthe SQLite website any information that would violate a law or breach a contract.\r\n\r\nSignature:\r\n\r\nName (printed):\r\n\r\nDate","risk":1,"spdx":"LicenseRef-SUSE-Public-Domain","trademark":0,"unique_id":"0966af42-5236-45b2-bd70-a1c7a9d89425"}
