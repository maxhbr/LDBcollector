I've given my thoughts on both, but I can't\r\nmake a final determination on either; that would be for RMS and Eben.\r\n\r\n* They believe that when the license talks about something being\r\n  \"distributed substantially in the same form as set out herein,\" it's\r\n  referring to the program -- implying that you can't radically alter \r\n  the software (i.e., take a piece of it and incorporate it in some   \r\n  totally different software).  I understand why they think that.  On \r\n  the other hand, I'm skeptical that this is the licensor's intent; I \r\n  think they just want to keep you from messing up the warranty \r\n  disclaimer too much. Unusually for Debian, apparently nobody tried to \r\n  clear this up with the original authors.  It might be worthwhile to \r\n  try that.  As it stands, I think we'd want to steer clear as well, as \r\n  we did with the original Artistic license.\r\n\r\n* They object to the requirement that you follow the law.  I'm not sure \r\n  if we have a general policy on this, but I know we've accepted similar\r\n  restrictions as being free before (the Intel Open Source License has\r\n  similar, though narrower, language), so I think we would still \r\n  consider the license free as well even with this text.\r\n\r\nIf you can get some kind of clarification on the first point, I'd be\r\nhappy to escalate this for further discussion.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nSo Mr Callaway asked me to clarify the intend of the original author\r\nwith respect to the word \"substantially\".\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the original Japanese version of\r\nthis license (which is included as \"LICENSE.jp.html\" in this rpm), \r\nthe part of the license which corresponds to the ICOT license\r\nparagraph, which contains the words \"substantially\", reads \r\nas below (in English):\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nEach user of this program may freely use, modify and make a copy of\r\nthis program. \"To modify this program\" used herein includes\r\n* to improve or to extend this program to make it better its\r\n  function, performance, and the quality\r\n* to add programs and documents you created by yourself,\r\nhowever, it (\"to modify this program\") is not limited to the above.\r\n\r\nEach user of this program may distribute to others\r\nthis program itself, or the modified version of this program,\r\nprovided\r\n* the section three (\"no warranty\") of this license is\r\n  included in it,\r\nfreely as long as the distribution won't violate the laws\r\nwhich may relate to the distribution.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nSo as mecab developers mention, who maintain mecab-ipadic \r\nsoftware currently, and also in my opinion, it does not seem \r\nto appear in the Japanese license the part which corresponds to \r\nthe words \"substantially in the same form\".  And in the Japanese \r\nlicense it is mentioned what to call \"the modified version\", which\r\ndeclares that the original developer imposes no limitation\r\nfor modifying this software.\r\n\r\nMr Callaway finally declared this license OK for Fedora\r\non Mar 8th, 2007.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nThis is good. Add a text file which says exactly what you just said as\r\nLICENSE.Fedora, include it in %doc, and it is ok for Fedora.\r\n\r\n~spot\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"05c2a3ce-d453-4194-96a5-c6f6d7071d65"}
