Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as\n   evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in\n   materials and workmanship under normal use.

Any implied warranties on the Software are limited to 90 days. Some states do not\n   allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above may not apply to you.

In no event will Sun's liability to you,\n   whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under\n   this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.\n   Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not\n   be applicable to you.\n\n   7.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail\n   to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
