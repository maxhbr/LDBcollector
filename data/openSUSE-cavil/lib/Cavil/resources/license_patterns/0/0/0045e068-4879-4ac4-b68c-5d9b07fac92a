You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible \r\nimplementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any \r\nIntellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. \"Intellectual Property Rights\" means any and all rights under \r\npatent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights.

Privacy and Information\r\n\r\n6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage statistics from the software \r\nincluding but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and information \r\non which tools and\/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information \r\nis collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.\r\n\r\n6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's \r\nPrivacy Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship \r\nwith these third parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.
