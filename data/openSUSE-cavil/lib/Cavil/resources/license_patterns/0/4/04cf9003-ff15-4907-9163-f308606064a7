We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,\r\n   please let us know!)\r\n2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.\r\n3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a\r\n   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\r\n   you've used the IJG code.\r\n\r\nIn legalese:\r\n\r\nThe authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\r\nwith respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\r\nfitness for a particular purpose.

Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium\r\nbut is also freely distributable.\r\n\r\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\r\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading\r\nsupport has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified\r\nto produce \"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW\r\nalgorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable\r\nby all standard GIF decoders","risk":1,"spdx":"IJG","trademark":0,"unique_id":"04cf9003-ff15-4907-9163-f308606064a7"}
