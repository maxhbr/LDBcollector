By contrast, the\n    <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License is intended to guarantee your\n    freedom to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it\n    remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,\n    use the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License for most of our\n    software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\n    authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n    General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\n    to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),\n    that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can\n    change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you\n    know you can do these things.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these\n    rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain\n    responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify\n    it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\n    for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you\n    received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Developers that use the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>\n    protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,\n    and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy,\n    distribute and\/or modify it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    For the developers&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; protection, the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> clearly explains that there is no warranty for this\n    free software.  For both users&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; sake, the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> requires that modified versions be marked as changed,\n    so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of\n    previous versions.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n    versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.\n    This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&rsquo;\n    freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\n    in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\n    is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the\n    <acronym>GPL<\/acronym> to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such\n    problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this\n    provision to those domains in future versions of the <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>,\n    as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States\n    should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on\n    general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the\n    special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it\n    effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the <acronym>GPL<\/acronym>\n    assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n    follow.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead>\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <bridgehead id=\"Definitions\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    0.

The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified\n    version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the\n    earlier work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work\n    based on the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without\n    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\n    under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or\n    modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with\n    or without modification), making available to the public, and in some\n    countries other activities as well.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables\n    other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\n    through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal\n    Notices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently\n    visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent\n    that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this\n    License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents\n    a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\n    list meets this criterion.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"SourceCode\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    1. Source Code.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the\n    work for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any\n    non-source form of a work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an\n    official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\n    widely used among developers working in that language.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything,\n    other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,\n    and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or\n    to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available\n    to the public in source code form.  A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this\n    context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so\n    on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work\n    runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter\n    used to run it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means\n    all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&rsquo;s\n    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which\n    are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes\n    interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n    the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that\n    the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\n    communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of\n    the work.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n    automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"BasicPermissions\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    2.

Those\n    thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on\n    your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them\n    from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their\n    relationship with you.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\n    conditions stated below.

Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring\n     solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a\n     copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than\n     this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.\n     These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.\n     Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\n     acceptance of this License to do so.\n   <\/para>\n   <bridgehead id=\"AutomaticDownstream\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n     10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   <\/bridgehead>\n   <para>\n     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a\n     license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that\n     work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing\n     compliance by third parties with this License.\n   <\/para>\n   <para>\n     An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control\n     of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work\n     results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\n     receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the\n     party&rsquo;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\n     paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the\n     work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get\n     it with reasonable efforts.\n   <\/para>\n   <para>\n     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\n     granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a\n     license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under\n     this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\n     or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed\n     by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or\n     any portion of it.\n   <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"Patents\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    11. Patents.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under\n    this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n    work thus licensed is called the contributor&rsquo;s &ldquo;contributor\n    version&rdquo;.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A contributor&rsquo;s &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent\n    claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by\n    this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do\n    not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further\n    modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition,\n    &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a\n    manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under the contributor&rsquo;s essential patent claims, to make, use,\n    sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the\n    contents of its contributor version.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any\n    express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a\n    patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not\n    to sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent\n    license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to\n    enforce a patent against the party.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n    Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free\n    of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available\n    network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)\n    cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive\n    yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or\n    (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\n    to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly\n    relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent\n    license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n    recipient&rsquo;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one\n    or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe\n    are valid.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,\n    you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and\n    grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work\n    authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the\n    covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to\n    all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include\n    within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work\n    if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n    business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third\n    party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under\n    which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the\n    covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\n    with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those\n    copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or\n    compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that\n    arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\n    implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be\n    available to you under applicable patent law.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"NoSurrender\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    12. No Surrender of Others&rsquo; Freedom.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n    Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License\n    would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"UsedWithAGPL\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    13. Use with the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to\n    link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the\n    <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License into a single combined\n    work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will\n    continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special\n    requirements of the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License,\n    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n    combination as such.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead id=\"RevisedVersions\" renderas=\"sect1\">\n    14.
