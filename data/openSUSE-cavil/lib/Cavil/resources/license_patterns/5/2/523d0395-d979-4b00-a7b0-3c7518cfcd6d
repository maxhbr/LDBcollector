Please also try to make sure that it is actually a bug in\nthe fonts and not e.g. in freetype (if a problem appears after a freetype\nupdate or if other fonts exhibit similar problems it is a sure sign that the\nproblem is in freetype).\n\nFurther details about Unicode coverage, glyph behaviour and possible issues can\nbe found on SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative website about writing systems at:\n'http:\/\/scripts.sil.org","risk":3,"spdx":"OFL-1.1","trademark":0,"unique_id":"523d0395-d979-4b00-a7b0-3c7518cfcd6d"}
