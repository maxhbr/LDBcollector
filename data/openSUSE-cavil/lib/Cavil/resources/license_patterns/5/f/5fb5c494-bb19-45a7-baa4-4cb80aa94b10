This list is not exclusive, but is just meant to        *\n * clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples.  *\n * These restrictions only apply when you actually redistribute Nmap.  For *\n * example, nothing stops you from writing and selling a proprietary       *\n * front-end to Nmap.  Just distribute it by itself, and point people to   *\n * http:\/\/nmap.org to download Nmap.                                       *\n *                                                                         *\n * We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, but *\n * just a clarification of how we interpret \"derived works\" as it applies  *\n * to our GPL-licensed Nmap product.  This is similar to the way Linus     *\n * Torvalds has announced his interpretation of how \"derived works\"        *\n * applies to Linux kernel modules.  Our interpretation refers only to     *\n * Nmap - we don't speak for any other GPL products.                       *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using *\n * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,  *\n * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary    *\n * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *\n * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *\n * as providing for priority support and updates as well as helping to     *\n * fund the continued development of Nmap technology.  Please email        *\n * sales@insecure.com for further information.                             *\n *                                                                         *\n * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants        *\n * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *\n * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *\n * listed in the included COPYING.OpenSSL file, and distribute linked      *\n * combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU GPL in all        *\n * respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.

You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *\n * to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation into the main         *\n * distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the         *\n * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are      *\n * offering Fyodor and Insecure.Com LLC the unlimited, non-exclusive right *\n * to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap will always be          *\n * available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to   *\n * relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software  *\n * projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also occasionally relicense the    *\n * code to third parties as discussed above.  If you wish to specify       *\n * special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you  *\n * send them.                                                              *\n *                                                                         *\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but     *\n * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of              *\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
