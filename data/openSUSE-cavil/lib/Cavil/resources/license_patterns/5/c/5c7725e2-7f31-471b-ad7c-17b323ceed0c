{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL-2.1+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being\n-     compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\n-     Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of\n-     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-     However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because\n-     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that\n-     uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this\n-     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such\n-     executables.\n-\n-     When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header\n-     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may\n-     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is\n-     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work\n-     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a\n-     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely\n-     defined by law.\n-\n-     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\n-     object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a\n-     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus\n-     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section\n-     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section\n-     6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\n-\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-     link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-     engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered\n-     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the\n-     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\n-     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a\n-     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,\n-     you must do one of these things:\n-\n-\n-       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-          machine-readable source code for the Library including\n-          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be\n-          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work\n-          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n-          machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code\n-          and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library\n-          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\n-          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who\n-          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\n-          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use\n-          the modified definitions.)\n-\n-\n-       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run\n-          time a copy of the library already present on the user's\n-          computer system, rather than copying library functions into\n-          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\n-          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as\n-          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version\n-          that the work was made with.\n-\n-\n-       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n-          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n-          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n-          performing this distribution.\n-\n-\n-       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\n-          copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy\n-          the above specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-\n-       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-\n-     For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-     Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special\n-     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include\n-     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n-     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of\n-     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\n-     component itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you\n-     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable\n-     that you distribute.\n-\n-\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other\n-     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\n-     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution\n-     of the work based on the Library and of the other library\n-     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these\n-     two things:\n-\n-\n-       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-          Sections above.\n-\n-\n-       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and\n-          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of\n-          the same work.\n-\n-\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\n-     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate\n-     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have\n-     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\n-     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-     full compliance.\n-\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\n-     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions\n-     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\n-     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\n-     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\n-     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\n-     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-\n- 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the\n-     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose\n-     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\n-     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\n-     by third parties with this License.\n-\n-\n- 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\n-     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\n-     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n-     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n-     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n-     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\n-     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit\n-     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who\n-     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\n-     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n-     entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\n-     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\n-     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n-     in other circumstances.\n-\n-     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of\n-     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\n-     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-     system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is\n-     willing to distribute software through any other system and a\n-     licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\n-     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-\n- 12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\n-     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this\n-     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\n-     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\n-     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this\n-     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\n-     this License.\n-\n-\n- 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\n-     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\n-     concerns.\n-\n-     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n-     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies\n-     to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\n-     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\n-     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library\n-     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any\n-     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-\n- 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with\n-     these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software\n-     which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the\n-     Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-     Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the\n-     free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\n-     promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-\n-                                NO WARRANTY","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"5c7725e2-7f31-471b-ad7c-17b323ceed0c"}
