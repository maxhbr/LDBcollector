To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n@heading TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n@html\n<div class=\"zero-list\"><\/div>\n@end html\n@enumerate 0\n@item Definitions.\n\n``This License'' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n``Copyright'' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n``The Program'' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.  ``Licensees'' and\n``recipients'' may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo ``modify'' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ``modified version'' of\nthe earlier work or a work ``based on'' the earlier work.\n\nA ``covered work'' means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo ``propagate'' a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo ``convey'' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays ``Appropriate Legal Notices'' to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n@item Source Code","risk":3,"spdx":"GPL-3.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"5cc00612-7344-4759-b2b4-fe846bd329c3"}
