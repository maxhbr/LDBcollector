It also counts\r\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\n the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\r\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are\r\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\r\nmake sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\r\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\r\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but\r\nwe suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the\r\nordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any\r\nparticular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not\r\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\r\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\r\nservice if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want\r\nit; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free\r\nprograms; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\r\nyou distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for\r\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You\r\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you\r\nlink other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to\r\nthe recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making\r\nchanges to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these\r\nterms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,\r\nand (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\r\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone\r\nelse and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not\r\nthe original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be\r\naffected by problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any\r\nfree program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively\r\nrestrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from\r\na patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a\r\nversion of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use\r\nspecified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\r\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\r\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the\r\nordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries\r\nin order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a\r\nshared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined\r\nwork, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public\r\nLicense therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits\r\nits criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax\r\ncriteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does\r\nLess to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.\r\nIt also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over\r\ncompeting non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the\r\nordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser\r\nlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\r\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto\r\nstandard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the\r\nlibrary. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as\r\nwidely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by\r\nlimiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\r\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\r\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables\r\nmany more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its\r\nvariant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\r\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\r\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a\r\nmodified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\r\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\r\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code\r\nderived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the\r\nlibrary in order to run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\r\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\r\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General\r\nPublic License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\r\n\"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so\r\nas to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\r\nthose functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has\r\nbeen distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\r\neither the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to\r\nsay, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or\r\nwith modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another\r\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the\r\nterm \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the\r\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\r\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\ninstallation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\r\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program\r\nusing the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is\r\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library\r\n(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether\r\nthat is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses\r\nthe Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\ndistribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\r\nmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\r\nthus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\r\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\r\nalso meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n   * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n   * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\r\n     that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n   * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to\r\n     all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n   * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the\r\n     facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\r\n     invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the\r\n     event an application does not supply such function or table, the\r\n     facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose\r\n     remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a\r\n     purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\r\n     Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied\r\n     function or table used by this function must be optional: if the\r\n     application does not supply it, the square root function must still\r\n     compute square roots.)\r\n\r\n     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\n     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n     sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\n     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n     on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n     collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n     with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a\r\n     storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\n     scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\r\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\r\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.\r\n(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you\r\nwish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,\r\nso the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies\r\nand derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library\r\ninto a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of\r\nit, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete\r\ncorresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\r\nthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\r\nsoftware interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\r\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\r\nfrom the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,\r\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\r\nthe object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but\r\nis designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is\r\ncalled a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a\r\nderivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\r\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\r\nof the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\r\nis therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for\r\ndistribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is\r\npart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\r\nof the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is\r\nespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if\r\nthe work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not\r\nprecisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\r\nlayouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten\r\nlines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,\r\nregardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables\r\ncontaining this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall\r\nunder Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute\r\nthe object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables\r\ncontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are\r\nlinked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a\r\n\"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing\r\nportions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your\r\nchoice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\r\ncustomer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library\r\nis used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\nYou must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution\r\ndisplays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the\r\nLibrary among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of\r\nthis License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\n   * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n     source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\r\n     work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if\r\n     the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\r\n     machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or\r\n     source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to\r\n     produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is\r\n     understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files\r\n     in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the\r\n     application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n   * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n     Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy\r\n     of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather\r\n     than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will\r\n     operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user\r\n     installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible\r\n     with the version that the work was made with.\r\n   * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n     years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,\r\n     above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this\r\n     distribution.\r\n   * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from\r\n     a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\r\n     materials from the same place.\r\n   * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials\r\n     or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\"\r\nmust include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the\r\nexecutable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be\r\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\r\neither source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\r\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\r\ncomponent itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\r\nother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\r\nsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\r\ntogether in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\r\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\r\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided\r\nthat the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the\r\nother library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do\r\nthese two things:\r\n\r\n   * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on\r\n     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\r\n     distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n   * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that\r\n     part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\r\n     the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\r\nis void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\r\nremain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\r\nit. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\r\nLibrary or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\r\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\r\nLibrary (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of\r\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\r\ndistributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\r\nlicensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\r\nthe recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so\r\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\r\nother pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute\r\nthe Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\r\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies\r\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both\r\nit and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\r\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\r\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\r\nsoftware distribution system which is implemented by public license\r\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\r\nsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\r\napplication of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or\r\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other system and a\r\nlicensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\r\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\r\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an\r\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\r\nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\r\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\r\nbody of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\r\nthe Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version\r\nnumber, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\r\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the\r\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\r\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\r\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\r\nTHE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO\r\nTHE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY\r\nPROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\r\nCORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\nLOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\r\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nSOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\r\nuse to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\r\nredistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under\r\nthese terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General\r\nPublic License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is\r\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year  name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\r\nLesser General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\r\nnecessary.
