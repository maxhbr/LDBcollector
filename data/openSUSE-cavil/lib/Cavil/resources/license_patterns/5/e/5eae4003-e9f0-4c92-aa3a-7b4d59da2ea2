The boss, say Alice uses the decoy photons, which are randomly in one of the four nonorthogonal single-photon states, to prevent a potentially dishonest agent from eavesdropping freely. This scheme requires the parties of communication to have neither an ideal single-photon quantum source nor a maximally entangled one, which makes this scheme more convenient than others in a practical application. Moreover, it has the advantage of having high intrinsic efficiency for qubits and exchanging less classical information in principle.  $SKIP19 All rights reserved","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"5eae4003-e9f0-4c92-aa3a-7b4d59da2ea2"}
