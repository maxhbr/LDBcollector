You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this source file\n%as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n%and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice\n%\"Copyright (C) 1986 Richard M.

(This alternative is\n%    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n%    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n%For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\n%all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\n%source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\n%operating system on which the executable file runs.\n\n%  4.
