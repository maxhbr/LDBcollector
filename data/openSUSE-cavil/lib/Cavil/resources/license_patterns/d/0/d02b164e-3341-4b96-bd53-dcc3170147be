You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\nand the Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n<\/p>\n<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\ncharge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\nthe public.\n<\/p>\n<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nMODIFICATIONS\n\n<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\nof the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\nif the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n<\/li><li>\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\n\n<\/li><li>\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\nModified Version, as the publisher.\n\n<\/li><li>\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n<\/li><li>\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\nadjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n<\/li><li>\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\ngiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\nterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n<\/li><li>\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.\n\n<\/li><li>\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n<\/li><li>\nPreserve the section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, and its title, and add to\nit an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\nthere is no section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\ngiven on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\nVersion as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n<\/li><li>\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\nthe network locations given in the Document for previous versions\nit was based on.

To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may add a section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n<\/p>\n<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nCOMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice.\n<\/p>\n<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n<\/p>\n<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;\nin the various original documents, forming one section entitled\n&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo;,\nand any sections entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections\nentitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nCOLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\nof the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\ncompilation.  Such a compilation is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo;, and this\nLicense does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\nwith the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\nare not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n<\/p>\n<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\nof the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\nOtherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\n<\/p>\n<\/li><li>\nTRANSLATION\n\n<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License provided that you also include the\noriginal English version of this License.
