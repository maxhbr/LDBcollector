You may, however,\nredistribute lcc in whole or in part provided you acknowledge its\nsource and include this CPYRIGHT file. You may, for example, include\nthe distribution in a CDROM of free software, provided you charge only\nfor the media, or mirror the distribution files at your site.\n\nYou may not sell lcc or any product derived from it in which it is a\nsignificant part of the value of the product. Using the lcc front end\nto build a C syntax checker is an example of this kind of product.\n\nYou may use parts of lcc in products as long as you charge for only\nthose components that are entirely your own and you acknowledge the use\nof lcc clearly in all product documentation and distribution media. You\nmust state clearly that your product uses or is based on parts of lcc\nand that lcc is available free of charge. You must also request that\nbug reports on your product be reported to you. Using the lcc front\nend to build a C compiler for the Motorola 88000 chip and charging for\nand distributing only the 88000 code generator is an example of this\nkind of product.\n\nUsing parts of lcc in other products is more problematic. For example,\nusing parts of lcc in a C++ compiler could save substantial time and\neffort and therefore contribute significantly to the profitability of\nthe product. This kind of use, or any use where others stand to make a\nprofit from what is primarily our work, requires a license agreement\nwith Addison-Wesley.
