Therefore the source\ncode can be distributed in unmodified or modified form consistent with\nthe terms of the license.\n\nThe Linux driver architecture was based on two modules, the MSF (Module\nspecific functions) and the HCF (Hardware Control Functions).  Included\nin the HCF is run-time firmware (binary format) which is downloaded into\nthe RAM of the Hermes 1\/2\/2.5 WMAC.\n\nThis hex coded firmware is not based on any open source software and\nhence it is not subject to any Open Source License.  The firmware was\ndeveloped by Agere and runs on the DISC processor embedded within the\nHermes 1\/2\/2.5 Wireless MAC devices. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nSincerely,\n\nViren Pathare\nIntellectual Property Licensing Manager\nAgere","risk":1,"spdx":"BSD-3-Clause","trademark":0,"unique_id":"dc701a88-4a5b-485d-a95e-14414e71e4f9"}
