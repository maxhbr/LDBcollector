To the extent any such license terms require that Datadog provide Customer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any open source software in the Access Tools that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Customer in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable open source license terms shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such open source software.

Customer agrees to comply with such third-party terms (including open source license terms), as applicable, and Datadog has no obligation or liability with respect to Third-Party Content under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n9.

Grant of Rights to Datadog.\r\n\r\n(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants Datadog a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license during the Term to use, reproduce, electronically distribute, transmit, have transmitted, perform, display, store, archive, and make derivative works of the Customer Data in order to provide and support the Services.\r\n\r\n(b) Further, Customer agrees that: (i) Datadog may use Customer Data to refine, supplement or test Datadog's product and service offerings; (ii) resulting reports, analyses and improvements to such offerings may be used for the benefit of any or all Datadog customers and in order to promote and market such offerings; (iii) Datadog may retain aggregated and anonymized Customer Data following any termination of this Agreement for use in connection with the activities described in this clause (b); and (iv) Datadog may include aggregated and anonymized Customer Data in any publicly available reports, analyses and promotional materials.

Datadog has no liability with respect to the use of User Identifications, including any Unauthorized Use. Use of any User Identification other than as provided in this Agreement will be considered a breach of this Agreement by Customer.\r\n\r\n(c) Limited Access; Changes. Datadog reserves the right at any time and without prior notice to Customer to limit Customer's and Authorized Users' access to and use of the Services in order to perform repairs, make modifications or as a result of circumstances beyond Datadog's reasonable control.

All Customer Data will be stored in the U.S. Datadog does not represent, and expressly disclaims, that it meets the standards for operational compliance or certification in any specific area, including any government or industry-association requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70 (SAS 70).\r\n\r\n(f) Right to Monitor.

Further, in the event of any action by Datadog to collect any amount not paid when due, Customer will pay or reimburse Datadog's costs of collection (including, without limitation, any attorneys' fees and court costs).\r\n\r\n(c) Taxes. Fees do not include sales tax, if applicable. Customer will pay or reimburse all taxes, duties and assessments, if any due, based on or measured by amounts payable to Datadog in any transaction between Customer and Datadog under this Agreement (excluding taxes based on Datadog's net income) together with any interest or penalties assessed thereon, or furnish Datadog with evidence acceptable to the taxing authority to sustain an exemption therefrom.\r\n\r\n14. Proprietary Rights and Confidentiality.\r\n\r\n(a) Customer Data.\r\nSubject only to the limited rights expressly granted in this Agreement, as between Customer and Datadog, Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data and all IP Rights therein. Customer is solely responsible, and Datadog assumes no liability, for the Customer Data that Authorized Users make available. Customer Data shall not: (i) create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to any person; (ii) create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (iv) contain any information or content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, or otherwise objectionable; (v) contain any information or content that is illegal; (vi) contains any information or content that Customer and its Authorized Users do not have a right to make available under any law, government or industry association requirements (including those referenced in Section 12(e)), or contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (vii) contain any information or content that Customer knows is not correct and current. Customer represents that the Customer Data does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any IP Rights, rights of publicity and privacy. Datadog takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Data that Authorized Users or other third parties post or send over the Services. Datadog is not responsible for any public display or misuse of Customer Data, except in the case of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by Datadog or its employees.\r\n\r\n(b) Technology.\r\nThe Services and Technology constitute or otherwise involve valuable IP Rights of Datadog and all right, title and interest in and to the foregoing shall, as between the parties, be owned by Datadog. Customer acknowledges that it obtains only limited use and license rights under this Agreement. No title to or ownership of the Services or Technology, or any IP Rights associated therewith, is transferred to Customer, any Authorized User or any third party under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n(c) Confidential Information.\r\n(i) As used in this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means any information that is proprietary or confidential to the Discloser (as defined below) or that the Discloser is obligated to keep confidential (e.g., pursuant to a contractual or other obligation owing to a third party).

However, Confidential Information does not include any information that: (A) was known to the Recipient (as defined below) prior to receiving the same from the Discloser in connection with this Agreement; (B) is independently developed by the Recipient; (C) is acquired by the Recipient from another source without restriction as to use or disclosure; or (D) is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or action of the Recipient.\r\n\r\n(ii) Each party reserves any and all right, title and interest (including any IP Rights) that it may have in or to any Confidential Information that it may disclose to the other party under this Agreement. The party that receives any Confidential Information (the \"Recepient\") of the other party (the \"Discloser\") will protect Confidential Information of the Discloser against any Unauthorized Use or disclosure to the same extent that the Recipient protects its own Confidential Information of a similar nature against Unauthorized Use or disclosure, but in no event will use less than a reasonable standard of care to protect such Confidential Information; provided that the Confidential Information of the Discloser is conspicuously marked or otherwise identified as confidential or proprietary upon receipt by the Recipient or the Recipient otherwise knows or has reason to know that the same is Confidential Information of the Discloser. The Recipient will use any Confidential Information of the Discloser solely for the purposes for which it is provided by the Discloser. This paragraph will not be interpreted or construed to prohibit: (A) any use or disclosure which is necessary or appropriate in connection with the Recipient's performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties; (B) any use or disclosure required by applicable law, provided that the Recipient uses reasonable efforts to give the Discloser reasonable advance notice thereof to afford the Discloser an opportunity to intervene and seek an order or other appropriate relief for the protection of its Confidential Information; or (C) any use or disclosure made with the consent of the Discloser. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of its obligations under this Section 14(c), the Discloser will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce such obligations. The obligations of confidentiality shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n15. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n(a) Term.\r\nThis Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 15(b) or (c), end on the \"Expiration Date\" specified in Exhibit A (the \"Term\").\r\n\r\n(b) Early Termination by Datadog.\r\nThis Agreement may be terminated by Datadog prior to the expiration of the Term: (i) if Customer defaults in the timely payment of any amounts due Datadog and fails to cure within 10 days of receipt of written notice; (ii) immediately if Customer breaches any provisions of Section 2, 6, 9, or 12(b); (iii) in the event of a material breach by Customer of any other provision of this Agreement and Customer fails to correct such breach within 30 days of written notice; (iv) upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of Customer; (v) in the event Datadog's relationship with a hosting provider for the Services terminates or requires Datadog to change the way it provides the Services and Datadog is unable, through commercially reasonable efforts, to move to another hosting provider; or (vi) in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations.\r\n\r\n(c) Early Termination by Customer.\r\nThis Agreement may be terminated by Customer prior to the expiration of the Term for any reason.\r\n\r\n(d) Effect of Expiration or Termination.\r\n(i) Upon expiration of this Agreement, or earlier termination pursuant to Section 15(b) or (c), then: (A) any and all rights granted to Customer with respect to the Services and Technology will terminate effective as of the effective date of termination; (B) Customer will return to Datadog any and all Confidential Information of Datadog in the possession or control of Customer; (C) subject to clause (ii) below, Datadog will return to Customer any and all Confidential Information of Customer in its possession or control; (D) unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, Datadog will have no obligation to provide the Services to Customer or Authorized Users after the effective date of the termination; and (E) Customer will pay to Datadog any amounts payable for Customer's and Authorized User's use of the Services through the effective date of the termination.\r\n\r\n(ii) Datadog's only obligation with respect to any electronic information transmitted or received by Customer or Authorized Users in relation to Customer's and Authorized User's use of the Services is, upon Customer's request, to provide to Customer a copy of the information that is stored in the Software database on the effective date of termination. Such information will be furnished in a format to be mutually agreed by the parties and Datadog's associated work will be subject to payment to Datadog of its then standard time-and-material fees.\r\n\r\n(e) Survival.\r\nThis Section 15(e), as well as Sections 8, 9, 10(b), 11, 13, 14, 15(d) and 16 through 21, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.\r\n16. Representations.\r\n\r\nEach party hereby represents and warrants to the other that the representing party has the authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and the party's entering into this Agreement, and performance of its obligations and exercise of its rights under this Agreement, do not and will not violate any applicable laws, regulations or orders. Further, Customer hereby represents, warrants and covenants that, without limiting the foregoing: (a) Customer or its licensors owns all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data; (b) Customer has all rights in Customer Data and Ideas necessary to grant the rights contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) Customer has obtained any necessary third-party approvals, including without limitations applicable vendors and licensors, in relation to Third-Party Content to be used by Customer in connection with the Services or will obtain such approvals prior to such use.\r\n\r\n17. Indemnity by Customer.\r\n\r\nCustomer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Datadog and its employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) Customer's and Authorized Users' use of and access to the Service; (b) Customer's or an Authorized User's violation of any term of this Agreement; (c) Customer's or an Authorized User's violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or IP Rights; (d) Customer's or an Authorized User's violation of any law, rule or regulation; (e) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any Customer Data; or (f) any other party's access and use of the Service with provided User Identification.\r\n\r\n18. IP Rights Indemnity.\r\n\r\nIf the Software becomes the subject of a claim of infringement of a U.S. copyright or patent, Datadog will indemnify Customer against such claim provided that Customer gives Datadog prompt written notice of the claim, allows Datadog to direct the defense and settlement of the claim, and cooperates with Datadog as necessary for defense and settlement of the claim. If the Software becomes, or, in Datadog's opinion is likely to become, the subject of such a claim, Datadog shall have the right to obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Software, replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing, or terminate the rights granted hereunder to such Software with refund to Customer of the fees paid for such Software (less a reasonable charge for the period during which Customer has had available to it the use of such Software). Datadog will have no liability for any infringement claim to the extent it (a) is based on modification of a Software other than by Datadog; (b) results from failure of Customer to use an updated version of a Software; (c) is based on the combination or use of a Software with any other software, program or device not provided by Datadog if such infringement would not have arisen but for such use or combination; (d) results from compliance by Datadog with designs, plans or specifications furnished by Customer; or (e) results from Customer's operation of the Software in a manner that is inconsistent with its intended use.
