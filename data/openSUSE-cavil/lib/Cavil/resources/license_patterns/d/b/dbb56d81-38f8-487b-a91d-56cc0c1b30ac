{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0 WITH Linking-exception","packname":"virtualbox","patent":0,"pattern":"1) The majority of code in the VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is\ncopyrighted by $SKIP30 This code is combined with third-party code\nthat was originally released under licenses which the Free Software Foundation\nconsiders incompatible with the GPL, such as the Apache License 2.0, the OpenSSL\nlicense, the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and the Slirp license. (Please see the\nVirtualBox User Manual for a complete list of third-party code and their\nlicenses.) As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the GPL listed\nbelow, Oracle gives you explicit permission to combine its GPL code contained in\nVirtualBox OSE with third-party code under the aforementioned licenses. You may\ncopy and distribute such a combination provided that you adhere to the terms and\nconditions of all of the GPL and the licenses of the third-party code; in\nparticular, you must include the source code of the entire combination insofar\nas the GPL requires distribution of source code.\n\n2) The GPL listed below does not bind software which uses VirtualBox services by\nmerely linking to VirtualBox libraries so long as all VirtualBox interfaces used\nby that software are multi-licensed. A VirtualBox interface is deemed\nmulti-licensed if it is declared in a VirtualBox header file that is licensed\nunder both the GPL version 2 (below) *and* the Common Development and\nDistribution License Version 1.0 (CDDL), as it comes in the \"COPYING.CDDL\" file.\nIn other words, calling such a multi-licensed interface is merely considered\nnormal use of VirtualBox and does not turn the calling code into a derived work\nof VirtualBox. In particular, this applies to code that wants to extend\nVirtualBox by way of the Extension Pack mechanism declared in the ExtPack.h\nheader file.\n\n3) Whoever creates or distributes a derived work based on VirtualBox OSE is not\nobligated to grant the above exceptions for such a version. The GPL allows for\nreleasing a modified version without the above exception; in addition, Oracle\nhereby also allows you to release a modified version which carries forward these\nexceptions","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"dbb56d81-38f8-487b-a91d-56cc0c1b30ac"}
