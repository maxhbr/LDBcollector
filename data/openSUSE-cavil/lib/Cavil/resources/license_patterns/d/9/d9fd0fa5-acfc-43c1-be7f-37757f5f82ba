You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things","risk":3,"spdx":"GPL-3.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"d9fd0fa5-acfc-43c1-be7f-37757f5f82ba"}
