Further, the patent grant is revoked\r\nfrom anyone who files a patent lawsuit about code in LLVM - this protects the\r\ncommunity by providing a \"patent commons\" for the code base and reducing the\r\nodds of patent lawsuits in general.\r\n\r\nThe license specifically scopes which patents are included with code\r\ncontributions.  To help explain this, the `Apache License FAQ\r\n<http:\/\/www.apache.org\/foundation\/license-faq.html>`_ explains this scope using\r\nsome questions and answers, which we reproduce here for your convenience (for\r\nreference, the \"ASF\" is the Apache Software Foundation, the guidance still\r\nholds though)::\r\n\r\n   Q1: If I own a patent and contribute to a Work, and, at the time my\r\n   contribution is included in that Work, none of my patent's claims are subject\r\n   to Apache's Grant of Patent License, is there a way any of those claims would\r\n   later become subject to the Grant of Patent License solely due to subsequent\r\n   contributions by other parties who are not licensees of that patent.\r\n\r\n   A1: No.\r\n\r\n   Q2: If at any time after my contribution, I am able to license other patent\r\n   claims that would have been subject to Apache's Grant of Patent License if\r\n   they were licenseable by me at the time of my contribution, do those other\r\n   claims become subject to the Grant of Patent License?\r\n\r\n   A2: Yes.\r\n\r\n   Q3: If I own or control a licensable patent and contribute code to a specific\r\n   Apache product, which of my patent claims are subject to Apache's Grant of\r\n   Patent License?\r\n\r\n   A3:  The only patent claims that are licensed to the ASF are those you own or\r\n   have the right to license that read on your contribution or on the\r\n   combination of your contribution with the specific Apache product to which\r\n   you contributed as it existed at the time of your contribution. No additional\r\n   patent claims become licensed as a result of subsequent combinations of your\r\n   contribution with any other software. Note, however, that licensable patent\r\n   claims include those that you acquire in the future, as long as they read on\r\n   your original contribution as made at the original time. Once a patent claim\r\n   is subject to Apache's Grant of Patent License, it is licensed under the\r\n   terms of that Grant to the ASF and to recipients of any software distributed\r\n   by the ASF for any Apache software product whatsoever.\r\n\r\n.. _legacy:\r\n\r\nLegacy License Structure\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n.. note::\r\n   The code base was previously licensed under the Terms described here.\r\n   We are in the middle of relicensing to a new approach (described above), but\r\n   until this effort is complete, the code is also still available under these\r\n   terms.  Once we finish the relicensing project, new versions of the code will\r\n   not be available under these terms.  However, nothing takes away your right\r\n   to use old versions under the licensing terms under which they were\r\n   originally released.\r\n\r\nWe intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and to use a permissive open\r\nsource license.  The code in\r\nLLVM is available under the `University of Illinois\/NCSA Open Source License\r\n<http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php>`_, which boils down to\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n* You can freely distribute LLVM.\r\n* You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM.\r\n* Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an\r\n  included README file).\r\n* You can't use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.\r\n* There's no warranty on LLVM at all.\r\n\r\nWe believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it **allows\r\ncommercial products to be derived from LLVM** with few restrictions and without\r\na requirement for making any derived works also open source (i.e. LLVM's\r\nlicense is not a \"copyleft\" license like the GPL). We suggest that you read the\r\n`License <http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php>`_ if further\r\nclarification is needed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the UIUC license, the runtime library components of LLVM\r\n(**compiler_rt, libc++, and libclc**) are also licensed under the `MIT License\r\n<http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/mit-license.php>`_, which does not contain\r\nthe binary redistribution clause.  As a user of these runtime libraries, it\r\nmeans that you can choose to use the code under either license (and thus don't\r\nneed the binary redistribution clause), and as a contributor to the code that\r\nyou agree that any contributions to these libraries be licensed under both\r\nlicenses.  We feel that this is important for runtime libraries, because they\r\nare implicitly linked into applications and therefore should not subject those\r\napplications to the binary redistribution clause. This also means that it is ok\r\nto move code from (e.g.)  libc++ to the LLVM core without concern, but that code","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"d9599978-4958-4792-82d5-c7d052d23b0f"}
