If Contributor\r\n        obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available\r\n        as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\r\n        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\r\n        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\r\n        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\r\n        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge\r\n        has been obtained.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an\r\n        application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge\r\n        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement\r\n        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the\r\n        LEGAL file.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\r\n        A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put\r\n        such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\r\n        structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such\r\n        as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look\r\n        for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\r\n        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described\r\n        in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any\r\n        documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'\r\n        rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may\r\n        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\r\n        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\r\n        Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,\r\n        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\r\n        You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\r\n        support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\r\n        alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\r\n        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\r\n        Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\r\n        indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\r\n        Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\r\n        Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You\r\n        include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the\r\n        Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\r\n        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\r\n        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\r\n        included in any notice in an Executable version, related\r\n        documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\r\n        rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the\r\n        Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a\r\n        license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from\r\n        this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\r\n        of this License and that the license for the Executable version\r\n        does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the\r\n        Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.\r\n        If You distribute the Executable version under a different\r\n        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\r\n        differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\r\n        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\r\n        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\r\n        liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\r\n        as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining\r\n        Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this\r\n        License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In\r\n        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\r\n        are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.If it is\r\n        impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\n        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\r\n        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply\r\n        with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;\r\n        and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such\r\n        description must be included in the LEGAL file described in\r\n        Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the\r\n        Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or\r\n        regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\r\n        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to\r\n        which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A\r\n        and to related Covered Code.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        6.

Netscape Communications Corporation\r\n        (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\r\n        License from time to time. Each version will be given a\r\n        distinguishing version number.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been\r\n        published under a particular version of the License, You may\r\n        always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\r\n        may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any\r\n        subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\r\n        other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable\r\n        to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version\r\n        of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to\r\n        code which is not already Covered Code governed by this\r\n        License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases\r\n        \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any\r\n        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except\r\n        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)\r\n        otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\r\n        contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\r\n        Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\r\n        Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described\r\n        in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be\r\n        modifications of this License.)\r\n      <\/para>\r\n\r\n      <para>\r\n        7.
