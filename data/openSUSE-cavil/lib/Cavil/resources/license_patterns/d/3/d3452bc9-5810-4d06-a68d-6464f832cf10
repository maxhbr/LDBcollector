For\r\nthe avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound\r\nrecording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\r\n(\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\r\n\r\nc. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\r\nterms of this License.\r\n\r\nd. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\r\n\r\ne. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nf. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\r\nhas not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work,\r\nor who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights\r\nunder this License despite a previous violation.\r\n\r\n2.

SOME\r\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH\r\nEXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\r\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\r\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\r\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7.
