DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT\r\n  RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS.\r\n  CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND\r\n  DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\r\n  .\r\n  License\r\n  .\r\n  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE\r\n  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY\r\n  COPYRIGHT AND\/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\r\n  AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\r\n  .\r\n  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO\r\n  BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE\r\n  CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED\r\n  HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\r\n  .\r\n  1. Definitions\r\n  .\r\n  a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\r\n  encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along\r\n  with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent\r\n  works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that\r\n  constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\r\n  defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n  .\r\n  b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and\r\n  other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,\r\n  dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art\r\n  reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work\r\n  may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a\r\n  Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of\r\n  this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\r\n  composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in\r\n  timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a\r\n  Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\r\n  .\r\n  c. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\r\n  offers the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n  .\r\n  d. \"Original Author\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\r\n  who created the Work.\r\n  .\r\n  e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms\r\n  of this License.\r\n  .\r\n  f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\r\n  who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\r\n  Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise\r\n  rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n  .\r\n  2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\r\n  restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\r\n  the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\r\n  applicable laws.\r\n  .\r\n  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\r\n  Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\r\n  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise\r\n  the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n  .\r\n  a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective\r\n  Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\r\n  .\r\n  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative\r\n  Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\r\n  clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the\r\n  original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work\r\n  was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\r\n  \"The original work has been modified.\";;\r\n  .\r\n  c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\r\n  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the\r\n  Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\r\n  .\r\n  d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\r\n  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission\r\n  Derivative Works.\r\n  .\r\n  e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:\r\n  .\r\n  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the\r\n  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that\r\n  Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,\r\n  SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public\r\n  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\r\n  .\r\n  ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive\r\n  right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or\r\n  designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You\r\n  create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the\r\n  compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or\r\n  the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\n  .\r\n  f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,\r\n  where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to\r\n  collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.\r\n  SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)\r\n  of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114\r\n  of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\n  .\r\n  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known\r\n  or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\r\n  modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\r\n  media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\r\n  reserved.\r\n  .\r\n  4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\r\n  subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n  .\r\n  a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\r\n  digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must\r\n  include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with\r\n  every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,\r\n  publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose\r\n  any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability\r\n  of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\n  under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must\r\n  keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\r\n  warranties.  When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\r\n  publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological\r\n  measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work\r\n  from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\r\n  the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a\r\n  Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the\r\n  Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a\r\n  Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\r\n  practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by\r\n  Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from\r\n  any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative\r\n  Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\r\n  .\r\n  b. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\r\n  digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative\r\n  Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in\r\n  Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\r\n  Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,\r\n  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the\r\n  Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or (ii) if the\r\n  Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a\r\n  sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\r\n  Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\r\n  reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if\r\n  supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource\r\n  Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,\r\n  unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\r\n  information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a\r\n  Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative\r\n  Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\r\n  \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\").  The credit required\r\n  by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\r\n  however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a\r\n  minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of\r\n  the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits\r\n  and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\r\n  contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit\r\n  required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\r\n  above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not\r\n  implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\r\n  endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as\r\n  appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\r\n  prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution\r\n  Parties.\r\n  .\r\n  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n  .\r\n  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\r\n  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE\r\n  LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\r\n  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR\r\n  OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY,\r\n  MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE\r\n  ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\r\n  ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\n  EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n  .\r\n  6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,\r\n  IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY\r\n  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT\r\n  OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF\r\n  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n  .\r\n  7. Termination\r\n  .\r\n  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\r\n  upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\r\n  who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or\r\n  Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License,\r\n  however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or\r\n  entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,\r\n  7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n  .\r\n  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\r\n  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\n  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\r\n  under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\r\n  provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\r\n  License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\r\n  under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\r\n  force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n  .\r\n  8. Miscellaneous\r\n  .\r\n  a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as\r\n  defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1\r\n  above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the\r\n  same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n  .\r\n  b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\r\n  Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\r\n  terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n  .\r\n  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\r\n  remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\r\n  parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\r\n  extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n  .\r\n  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\r\n  consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by\r\n  the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n  .\r\n  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\r\n  respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\r\n  representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall\r\n  not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\r\n  communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\r\n  written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n  .\r\n  Creative Commons Notice\r\n  .\r\n  Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\n  whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable\r\n  to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including\r\n  without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages\r\n  arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)\r\n  sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the\r\n  Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\r\n  .\r\n  Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is\r\n  licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by\r\n  either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or\r\n  logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative\r\n  Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'\r\n  then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website\r\n  or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance\r\n  of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of the License.\r\n  .\r\n  Creative Commons may be contacted at http:\/\/creativecommons.org","risk":2,"spdx":"CC-BY-3.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"df2f629c-9d65-4fb9-a1a8-1b68e39ee685"}
