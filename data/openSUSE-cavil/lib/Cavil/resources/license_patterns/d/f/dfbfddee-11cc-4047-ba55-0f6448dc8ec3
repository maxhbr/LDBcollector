It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n@item\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\nA ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n@sc{ascii} without markup, Texinfo input format, La@TeX{} input\nformat, SGML or XML using a publicly available\nDTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,\nPostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples\nof transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and\nJPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be\nread and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or\nXML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are\nnot generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,\nPostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for\noutput purposes only.\n\nThe ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',\n``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n@item\nVERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n@item\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"dfbfddee-11cc-4047-ba55-0f6448dc8ec3"}
