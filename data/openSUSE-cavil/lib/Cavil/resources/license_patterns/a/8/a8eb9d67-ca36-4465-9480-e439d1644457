PREAMBLE\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\r\nwritten document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the\r\neffective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying\r\nit, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License\r\npreserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\r\nwork, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works\r\nof the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It\r\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\r\ndesigned for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program\r\nshould come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\r\ndoes. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\r\nused for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is\r\npublished as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\r\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section1:\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n================================\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-document:\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice\r\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the\r\nterms of this License. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual\r\nor work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as\r\n“you”.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-modified:\r\n\r\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the\r\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\r\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-secondary:\r\n\r\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\r\nthe :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` that deals exclusively with the\r\nrelationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the\r\nDocument's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing\r\nthat could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if\r\nthe Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section\r\nmay not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of\r\nhistorical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of\r\nlegal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\r\nregarding them.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-invariant:\r\n\r\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain\r\n:ref:`Secondary Sections <fdl-secondary>` whose titles are designated,\r\nas being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` is released under this License.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-cover-texts:\r\n\r\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\r\nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` is released under this License.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-transparent:\r\n\r\nA “Transparent” copy of the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` means a\r\nmachine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is\r\navailable to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited\r\ndirectly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images\r\ncomposed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely\r\navailable drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text\r\nformatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\r\nfor input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent\r\nfile format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\r\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is\r\nnot “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\r\nwithout markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML\r\nusing a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML\r\ndesigned for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,\r\nproprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word\r\nprocessors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are\r\nnot generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some\r\nword processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-title-page:\r\n\r\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus\r\nsuch following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this\r\nLicense requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which\r\ndo not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the\r\nmost prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\r\nof the body of the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section2:\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n===================\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` in any\r\nmedium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this\r\nLicense, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this\r\nLicense applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that\r\nyou add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may\r\nnot use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\r\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\r\ncompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\r\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in\r\n:ref:`section 3 <fdl-section3>`.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\r\nyou may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section3:\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n======================\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies of the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`\r\nnumbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires\r\n:ref:`Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>`, you must enclose the copies in\r\ncovers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:\r\nFront-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back\r\ncover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the\r\npublisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title\r\nwith all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\r\nother material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited\r\nto the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` and satisfy these conditions, can be\r\ntreated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute :ref:`Opaque <fdl-transparent>` copies of\r\nthe :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` numbering more than 100, you must\r\neither include a machine-readable :ref:`Transparent <fdl-transparent>`\r\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\r\npublicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\r\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\r\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\r\ncharge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter\r\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\r\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\r\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\r\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\r\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` well before redistributing any large\r\nnumber of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated\r\nversion of the Document.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section4:\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n================\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`\r\nof the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` under the conditions of sections\r\n:ref:`2 <fdl-section2>` and :ref:`3 <fdl-section3>` above, provided\r\nthat you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with\r\nthe Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing\r\ndistribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever\r\npossesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the\r\nModified Version:\r\n\r\n-  **A.**\r\n   Use in the :ref:`Title Page <fdl-title-page>` (and on the covers,\r\n   if any) a title distinct from that of the\r\n   :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`, and from those of previous versions\r\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of\r\n   the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if\r\n   the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n\r\n-  **B.**\r\n   List on the :ref:`Title Page <fdl-title-page>`, as authors, one or\r\n   more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the\r\n   modifications in the :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`,\r\n   together with at least five of the principal authors of the\r\n   :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` (all of its principal authors, if it\r\n   has less than five).\r\n\r\n-  **C.**\r\n   State on the :ref:`Title Page <fdl-title-page>` the name of the\r\n   publisher of the :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`, as the\r\n   publisher.\r\n\r\n-  **D.**\r\n   Preserve all the copyright notices of the\r\n   :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`.\r\n\r\n-  **E.**\r\n   Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent\r\n   to the other copyright notices.\r\n\r\n-  **F.**\r\n   Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\n   giving the public permission to use the\r\n   :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>` under the terms of this\r\n   License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n\r\n-  **G.**\r\n   Preserve in that license notice the full lists of\r\n   :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` and required\r\n   :ref:`Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>` given in the\r\n   :ref:`Document's <fdl-document>` license notice.\r\n\r\n-  **H.**\r\n   Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n\r\n-  **I.**\r\n   Preserve the section entitled “History”, and its title, and add to it\r\n   an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher\r\n   of the :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>` as given on the\r\n   :ref:`Title Page <fdl-title-page>`. If there is no section entitled\r\n   “History” in the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`, create one stating\r\n   the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on\r\n   its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as\r\n   stated in the previous sentence.\r\n\r\n-  **J.**\r\n   Preserve the network location, if any, given in the\r\n   :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` for public access to a\r\n   :ref:`Transparent <fdl-transparent>` copy of the Document, and\r\n   likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous\r\n   versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History”\r\n   section. You may omit a network location for a work that was\r\n   published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the\r\n   original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n\r\n-  **K.**\r\n   In any section entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, preserve\r\n   the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance\r\n   and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or\r\n   dedications given therein.\r\n\r\n-  **L.**\r\n   Preserve all the :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` of the\r\n   :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`, unaltered in their text and in\r\n   their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered\r\n   part of the section titles.\r\n\r\n-  **M.**\r\n   Delete any section entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be\r\n   included in the :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`.\r\n\r\n-  **N.**\r\n   Do not retitle any existing section as “Endorsements” or to conflict\r\n   in title with any :ref:`Invariant Section <fdl-invariant>`.\r\n\r\nIf the :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>` includes new\r\nfront-matter sections or appendices that qualify as\r\n:ref:`Secondary Sections <fdl-secondary>` and contain no material\r\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\r\nof these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list\r\nof :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` in the Modified Version's\r\nlicense notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains\r\nnothing but endorsements of your\r\n:ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>` by various parties--for\r\nexample, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by\r\nan organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a\r\n:ref:`Front-Cover Text <fdl-cover-texts>`, and a passage of up to 25\r\nwords as a :ref:`Back-Cover Text <fdl-cover-texts>`, to the end of the\r\nlist of :ref:`Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>` in the\r\n:ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`. Only one passage of\r\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through\r\narrangements made by) any one entity. If the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` already includes a cover text for the\r\nsame cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same\r\nentity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\r\nreplace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher\r\nthat added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>`\r\ndo not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity\r\nfor or to assert or imply endorsement of any\r\n:ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section5:\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n======================\r\n\r\nYou may combine the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` with other\r\ndocuments released under this License, under the terms defined in\r\n:ref:`section 4 <fdl-section4>` above for modified versions, provided\r\nthat you include in the combination all of the\r\n:ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` of all of the original\r\ndocuments, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your\r\ncombined work in its license notice.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\nmultiple identical :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` may be\r\nreplaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections\r\nwith the same name but different contents, make the title of each such\r\nsection unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of\r\nthe original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\r\nunique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the\r\nlist of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled “History” in\r\nthe various original documents, forming one section entitled “History”;\r\nlikewise combine any sections entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any\r\nsections entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections entitled\r\n“Endorsements.”\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section6:\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` and other documents released under this\r\nLicense, and replace the individual copies of this License in the\r\nvarious documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,\r\nprovided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying\r\nof each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and dispbibute\r\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\r\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\r\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section7:\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nA compilation of the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` or its derivatives\r\nwith other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a\r\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as\r\na :ref:`Modified Version <fdl-modified>` of the Document, provided no\r\ncompilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation\r\nis called an “aggregate”, and this License does not apply to the other\r\nself-contained works thus compiled with the Document , on account of\r\ntheir being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works\r\nof the Document. If the :ref:`Cover Text <fdl-cover-texts>`\r\nrequirement of :ref:`section 3 <fdl-section3>` is applicable to these\r\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of\r\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers\r\nthat surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they\r\nmust appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section8:\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n==============\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\r\ntranslations of the :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` under the terms of\r\n:ref:`section 4 <fdl-section4>`. Replacing\r\n:ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>` with translations requires\r\nspecial permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\r\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\r\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a\r\ntranslation of this License provided that you also include the original\r\nEnglish version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the\r\ntranslation and the original English version of this License, the\r\noriginal English version will prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section9:\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n==============\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\r\n:ref:`Document <fdl-document>` except as expressly provided for under\r\nthis License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or\r\ndistribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\r\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-section10:\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n====================================\r\n\r\nThe `Free Software Foundation <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/fsf\/fsf.html>`__\r\nmay publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License\r\nfrom time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\r\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\r\nconcerns. See\r\n`http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/ <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft>`__.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If\r\nthe :ref:`Document <fdl-document>` specifies that a particular\r\nnumbered version of this License “or any later version” applies to it,\r\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nspecified version or of any later version that has been published (not\r\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not\r\nspecify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\r\never published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _fdl-using:\r\n\r\nAddendum\r\n========\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\r\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and license\r\nnotices just after the title page:\r\n\r\n    Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME.\r\n\r\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this\r\n    document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,\r\n    Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software\r\n    Foundation; with the :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>`\r\n    being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n    :ref:`Front-Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>` being LIST, and with\r\n    the :ref:`Back-Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>` being LIST. A copy\r\n    of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free\r\n    Documentation License”.\r\n\r\nIf you have no :ref:`Invariant Sections <fdl-invariant>`, write “with\r\nno Invariant Sections” instead of saying which ones are invariant. If\r\nyou have no :ref:`Front-Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>`, write “no\r\nFront-Cover Texts” instead of “Front-Cover Texts being LIST”; likewise\r\nfor :ref:`Back-Cover Texts <fdl-cover-texts>`.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\r\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free\r\nsoftware license, such as the\r\n`GNU General Public License <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/gpl.html>`__,\r\nto permit their use in free software.\r\n","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a8eb9d67-ca36-4465-9480-e439d1644457"}
