It also counts\r\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the\r\nversion number 2.1.]\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@center Preamble\r\n@sp 1\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\r\nshare and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are\r\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\r\nmake sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\r\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use\r\nit too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this\r\nlicense or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\r\nuse in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if\r\nyou want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in\r\nnew free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or\r\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.\r\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\r\nIf you link other code with the library, you must provide complete\r\nobject files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the\r\nlibrary after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you\r\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is\r\nno warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by\r\nsomeone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they\r\nhave is not the original version, so that the original author's\r\nreputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any\r\nfree program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively\r\nrestrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license\r\nfrom a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license\r\nobtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full\r\nfreedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\r\nGNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different\r\nfrom the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for\r\ncertain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into\r\nnon-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a\r\nshared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire\r\ncombination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public\r\nLicense permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the ``Lesser'' General Public License because it does\r\nLess to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public\r\nLicense.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an\r\nadvantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the\r\nreason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.\r\nHowever, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage\r\nthe widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a\r\nde-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed\r\nto use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does\r\nthe same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is\r\nlittle to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we\r\nuse the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free\r\nsoftware.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\r\nprograms enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,\r\nas well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked\r\nwith the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program\r\nusing a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The\r\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\n@page\r\n\r\n@center GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n@enumerate 0\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\r\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other\r\nauthorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this\r\nLesser General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each\r\nlicensee is addressed as ``you''.\r\n\r\nA ``library'' means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work which\r\nhas been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the Library''\r\nmeans either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either\r\nverbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into\r\nanother language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without\r\nlimitation in the term ``modification''.)\r\n\r\n``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the\r\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\r\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\ninstallation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running\r\na program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a\r\nprogram is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nLibrary (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\r\nit).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the\r\nprogram that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\ndistribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\r\nthus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\r\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that\r\nyou also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n@enumerate a\r\n\r\n@item\r\nThe modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\r\nthat you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\r\nthird parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nIf a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\r\ndata to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,\r\nother than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you\r\nmust make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an\r\napplication does not supply such function or table, the facility still\r\noperates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a\r\npurpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\r\nTherefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function\r\nor table used by this function must be optional: if the application does\r\nnot supply it, the square root function must still compute square\r\nroots.)\r\n\r\n@end enumerate\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and\r\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\nthe Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a\r\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\nscope of this License.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that\r\nthey refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\nthese notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that\r\ncopy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\r\nLibrary into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of\r\nit, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\r\nof Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the\r\ncomplete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\r\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\r\ncode from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the\r\nsource code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\r\nsource along with the object code.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but\r\nis designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with\r\nit, is called a ``work that uses the Library''.  Such a work, in\r\nisolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls\r\noutside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library creates\r\nan executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains\r\nportions of the Library), rather than a ``work that uses the library''.\r\nThe executable is therefore covered by this License.  Section 6 states\r\nterms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a ``work that uses the Library'' uses material from a header file\r\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked\r\nwithout the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold\r\nfor this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\r\nlayouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten\r\nlines or less in length), then the use of the object file is\r\nunrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.\r\n(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\r\nwill still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether\r\nor not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a\r\n``work that uses the Library'' with the Library to produce a work\r\ncontaining portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms\r\nof your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work\r\nfor the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\nof these things:\r\n\r\n@enumerate a\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nAccompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\nsource code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\r\nwork (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if\r\nthe work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\r\nmachine-readable ``work that uses the Library'', as object code and\/or\r\nsource code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to\r\nproduce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is\r\nunderstood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files\r\nin the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\nto use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nUse a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A\r\nsuitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the\r\nlibrary already present on the user's computer system, rather than\r\ncopying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate\r\nproperly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs\r\none, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the\r\nversion that the work was made with.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nAccompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\r\nto give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,\r\nfor a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nIf distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\r\ndesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\r\nmaterials from the same place.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nVerify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\r\nthat you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\n@end enumerate\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the ``work that uses the Library''\r\nmust include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the\r\nexecutable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to\r\nbe distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed\r\n(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\r\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,\r\nunless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions\r\nof other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the\r\noperating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them\r\nand the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\r\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities\r\nnot covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\r\nprovided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library\r\nand of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided\r\nthat you do these two things:\r\n\r\n@enumerate a\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nAccompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\r\nLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nGive prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\r\nit is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n@end enumerate\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\nLibrary is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\r\nLicense.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as\r\nsuch parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\r\nit.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute\r\nthe Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by\r\nlaw if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or\r\ndistributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you\r\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and\r\nconditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works\r\nbased on it.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license\r\nwould not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those\r\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way\r\nyou could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\r\nfrom distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented\r\nby public license practices.  Many people have made generous\r\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\r\nthe author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\r\na consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nIf the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\r\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an\r\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\nwritten in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\r\nthe Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\r\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any\r\nlater version'', you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license\r\nversion number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.\r\n\r\n@sp 1\r\n@item\r\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\r\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the\r\nauthor to ask for permission.
