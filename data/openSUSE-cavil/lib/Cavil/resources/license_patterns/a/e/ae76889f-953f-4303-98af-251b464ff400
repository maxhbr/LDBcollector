Are the CM-Super fonts legal?\n\nA.4. Yes, the fonts are totally legal. Licenses of EC\/TC, EC Concrete,\nEC Bright and LH fonts allow production and distribution of Type 1\nfonts.\n\nQ.5. What are the drawbacks? Size? Is it true that the converted fonts\nare more than 3 times larger than commercial fonts (statement on the\nTeXtrace site)?\n\nA.5. No, this is not applicable to CM-Super fonts. Their size is\ncomparable to the size of commercial fonts.
