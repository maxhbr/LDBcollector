I assumed that since GPG was GPLd, you'd prefer the GPL for the entropy\n code as well, but Ian asked for LGPL as an option so as of the next release\n I'll have LGPL in there.  You can consider it to be retroactive, so your\n current version will be LGPLd as well.\n\n Peter","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a43cee1a-dacb-4045-a325-ab4b21998267"}
