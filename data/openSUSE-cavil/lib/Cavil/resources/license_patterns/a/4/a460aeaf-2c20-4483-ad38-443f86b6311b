Each licensee is addressed \n\t\t\t\tas \"you\".<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as \n\t\t\t\tto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those \n\t\t\t\tfunctions and data) to form executables.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been \n\t\t\t\tdistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the \n\t\t\t\tLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work \n\t\t\t\tcontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with \n\t\t\t\tmodifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. \n\t\t\t\t(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \n\t\t\t\t\"modification\".)\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \n\t\t\t\tmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source \n\t\t\t\tcode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition \n\t\t\t\tfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the \n\t\t\t\tlibrary.<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by \n\t\t\t\tthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using \n\t\t\t\tthe Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only \n\t\t\t\tif its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use \n\t\t\t\tof the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what \n\t\t\t\tthe Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>1.<\/STRONG> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's \n\t\t\t\tcomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you \n\t\t\t\tconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright \n\t\t\t\tnotice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to \n\t\t\t\tthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this \n\t\t\t\tLicense along with the Library.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at \n\t\t\t\tyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>2.<\/STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any \n\t\t\t\tportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and \n\t\t\t\tdistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, \n\t\t\t\tprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t\t<P>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you \n\t\t\t\t\tchanged the files and the date of any change.<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third \n\t\t\t\t\tparties under the terms of this License.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data \n\t\t\t\t\tto be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as \n\t\t\t\t\tan argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good \n\t\t\t\t\tfaith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such \n\t\t\t\t\tfunction or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of \n\t\t\t\t\tits purpose remains meaningful.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that \n\t\t\t\t\tis entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection \n\t\t\t\t\t2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this \n\t\t\t\t\tfunction must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square \n\t\t\t\t\troot function must still compute square roots.)\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \n\t\t\t\t\tsections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably \n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and \n\t\t\t\t\tits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate \n\t\t\t\t\tworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a \n\t\t\t\t\twork based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms \n\t\t\t\t\tof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire \n\t\t\t\t\twhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your \n\t\t\t\t\trights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \n\t\t\t\t\tright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \n\t\t\t\t\tthe Library.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the \n\t\t\t\t\tLibrary (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or \n\t\t\t\t\tdistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this \n\t\t\t\t\tLicense.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<\/BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>3.<\/STRONG> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General \n\t\t\t\tPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do \n\t\t\t\tthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they \n\t\t\t\trefer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this \n\t\t\t\tLicense. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public \n\t\t\t\tLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) \n\t\t\t\tDo not make any other change in these notices.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so \n\t\t\t\tthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and \n\t\t\t\tderivative works made from that copy.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into \n\t\t\t\ta program that is not a library.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>4.<\/STRONG> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or \n\t\t\t\tderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the \n\t\t\t\tterms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the \n\t\t\t\tcomplete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed \n\t\t\t\tunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for \n\t\t\t\tsoftware interchange.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a \n\t\t\t\tdesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from \n\t\t\t\tthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even \n\t\t\t\tthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object \n\t\t\t\tcode.<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>5.<\/STRONG> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the \n\t\t\t\tLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked \n\t\t\t\twith it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, \n\t\t\t\tis not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope \n\t\t\t\tof this License.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an \n\t\t\t\texecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of \n\t\t\t\tthe Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is \n\t\t\t\ttherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of \n\t\t\t\tsuch executables.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is \n\t\t\t\tpart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of \n\t\t\t\tthe Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is \n\t\t\t\tespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the \n\t\t\t\twork is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely \n\t\t\t\tdefined by law.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts \n\t\t\t\tand accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less \n\t\t\t\tin length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of \n\t\t\t\twhether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object \n\t\t\t\tcode plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the \n\t\t\t\tobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables \n\t\t\t\tcontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked \n\t\t\t\tdirectly with the Library itself.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>6.<\/STRONG> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine \n\t\t\t\tor link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work \n\t\t\t\tcontaining portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of \n\t\t\t\tyour choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the \n\t\t\t\tcustomer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is \n\t\t\t\tused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You \n\t\t\t\tmust supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays \n\t\t\t\tcopyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among \n\t\t\t\tthem, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. \n\t\t\t\tAlso, you must do one of these things:\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t\t<P>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source \n\t\t\t\t\tcode for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which \n\t\t\t\t\tmust be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an \n\t\t\t\t\texecutable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work \n\t\t\t\t\tthat uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can \n\t\t\t\t\tmodify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing \n\t\t\t\t\tthe modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents \n\t\t\t\t\tof definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile \n\t\t\t\t\tthe application to use the modified definitions.)\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A \n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library \n\t\t\t\t\talready present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library \n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified \n\t\t\t\t\tversion of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified \n\t\t\t\t\tversion is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to \n\t\t\t\t\tgive the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a \n\t\t\t\t\tcharge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a \n\t\t\t\t\tdesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials \n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the same place.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that \n\t\t\t\t\tyou have already sent this user a copy.<\/P>\n\t\t\t<\/BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t<P>For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must \n\t\t\t\tinclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable \n\t\t\t\tfrom it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need \n\t\t\t\tnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary \n\t\t\t\tform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating \n\t\t\t\tsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies \n\t\t\t\tthe executable.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of \n\t\t\t\tother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating \n\t\t\t\tsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library \n\t\t\t\ttogether in an executable that you distribute.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>7.<\/STRONG> You may place library facilities that are a work based on \n\t\t\t\tthe Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library \n\t\t\t\tfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, \n\t\t\t\tprovided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of \n\t\t\t\tthe other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do \n\t\t\t\tthese two things:\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t\t<P>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the \n\t\t\t\t\tLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed \n\t\t\t\t\tunder the terms of the Sections above.\n\t\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t\t<P>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it \n\t\t\t\t\tis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying \n\t\t\t\t\tuncombined form of the same work.<\/P>\n\t\t\t<\/BLOCKQUOTE>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>8.<\/STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or \n\t\t\t\tdistribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any \n\t\t\t\tattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the \n\t\t\t\tLibrary is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this \n\t\t\t\tLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under \n\t\t\t\tthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties \n\t\t\t\tremain in full compliance.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>9.<\/STRONG> You are not required to accept this License, since you have \n\t\t\t\tnot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or \n\t\t\t\tdistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by \n\t\t\t\tlaw if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing \n\t\t\t\tthe Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of \n\t\t\t\tthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, \n\t\t\t\tdistributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>10.<\/STRONG> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based \n\t\t\t\ton the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the \n\t\t\t\toriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject \n\t\t\t\tto these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on \n\t\t\t\tthe recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible \n\t\t\t\tfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>11.<\/STRONG> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of \n\t\t\t\tpatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), \n\t\t\t\tconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) \n\t\t\t\tthat contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the \n\t\t\t\tconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy \n\t\t\t\tsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent \n\t\t\t\tobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. \n\t\t\t\tFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution \n\t\t\t\tof the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through \n\t\t\t\tyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to \n\t\t\t\trefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any \n\t\t\t\tparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and \n\t\t\t\tthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or \n\t\t\t\tother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this \n\t\t\t\tsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software \n\t\t\t\tdistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many \n\t\t\t\tpeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \n\t\t\t\tdistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that \n\t\t\t\tsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to \n\t\t\t\tdistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that \n\t\t\t\tchoice.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a \n\t\t\t\tconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\t\t\t<\/P>\n\t\t\t<P><STRONG>12.<\/STRONG> If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted \n\t\t\t\tin certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the \n\t\t\t\toriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an \n\t\t\t\texplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so \n\t\t\t\tthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
