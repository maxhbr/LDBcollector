The purpose of this License is for the Licensor named above to\r\npermit the Licensee (as defined below) broad permission, if consistent\r\nwith Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles (as each is defined\r\nbelow), to use and work with the Software (as defined below) within the\r\nfull scope of Licensor’s copyright and patent rights, if any, in the\r\nSoftware, while ensuring attribution and protecting the Licensor from\r\nliability.\r\n\r\nPermission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this\r\nlicense (\"License\"), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor’s\r\nrights under applicable copyright and patent law, to any person or\r\nentity (the \"Licensee\") obtaining a copy of this software and\r\nassociated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to do everything with\r\nthe Software that would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor’s copyright\r\nin the Software or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the\r\nLicensor can license or becomes able to license, subject to all of the\r\nfollowing terms and conditions:\r\n\r\n* Acceptance. This License is automatically offered to every person and\r\nentity subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this\r\nLicense and agrees to its terms and conditions by taking any action with\r\nthe Software that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual\r\nproperty right held by Licensor.\r\n* Notice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part\r\nof this Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also receives\r\nthe License and the above copyright notice (and if included by the\r\nLicensor, patent, trademark and attribution notice). Licensee must cause\r\nany modified versions of the Software to carry prominent notices stating\r\nthat Licensee changed the Software. For clarity, although Licensee is\r\nfree to create modifications of the Software and distribute only the\r\nmodified portion created by Licensee with additional or different terms,\r\nthe portion of the Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to\r\nthis License. If anyone notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has\r\nnot complied with this Notice section, Licensee can keep this License by\r\ntaking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If\r\nLicensee does not do so, Licensee’s License (and all rights licensed\r\nhereunder) shall end immediately.\r\n* Compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws.\r\n[arabic]\r\n. Human Rights Principles.\r\n[loweralpha]\r\n.. Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global\r\nCompact that define recognized principles of international human rights\r\n(the \"Human Rights Principles\"). Licensee shall use the Software in a\r\nmanner consistent with Human Rights Principles.\r\n.. Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute,\r\ncontroversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a)\r\nregarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a),\r\ntermination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles,\r\nor invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law\r\nis consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to\r\nSection 2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the\r\nHague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the \"Rules\");\r\nprovided, however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such\r\narbitration, in which event this License (and all rights licensed\r\nhereunder) shall end immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one\r\nunless the Rules require otherwise.\r\n+\r\nUnless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All\r\ndocuments and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and\r\nmay be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under\r\nArticle 43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely\r\nmanner all documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated\r\nto it, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted\r\ninto the record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings\r\nof hearings and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral\r\ntribunal, subject only to the arbitral tribunal’s powers to take such\r\nmeasures as may be necessary to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral\r\nprocess pursuant to Articles 18, 33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3)\r\nArticle 26(6) of the Rules shall not apply.\r\n. Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or\r\nentity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human\r\nRights Laws. \"Human Rights Laws\" means any applicable laws,\r\nregulations, or rules (collectively, \"Laws\") that protect human,\r\ncivil, labor, privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due\r\nprocess, or similar rights; provided, however, that such Laws are\r\nconsistent and not in conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute\r\nover the consistency or a conflict between Laws and Human Rights\r\nPrinciples shall be determined by arbitration as stated above). Where\r\nthe Human Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable or in\r\nconflict with respect to the use of the Software, the Human Rights Laws\r\nthat are most protective of the individuals or groups harmed shall\r\napply.\r\n. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and\r\nany other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities,\r\ndeficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards,\r\npenalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including\r\nLicensor’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to\r\nLicensee’s use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or\r\nHuman Rights Principles.\r\n* Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the\r\nterms and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and\r\nan infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor\r\n(subject to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a\r\nbreach or infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\r\nenforced by Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which\r\nLicensee is subject. Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce\r\nthe terms and conditions of this License against Licensee through\r\nspecific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the extent\r\npermitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this\r\nLicense, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor\r\nmay not terminate this License with Licensee.\r\n* Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this\r\nLicense is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a\r\ncourt of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or\r\nunenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this\r\nLicense or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in\r\nany other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court\r\nmodification pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term\r\nor provision of this License pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human\r\nRights Principles is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against\r\nLicensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the\r\nSoftware granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between\r\nLicensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision\r\nis invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws,\r\nthe court may modify this License to affect the original purpose that\r\nthe Software be used in compliance with Human Rights Principles and\r\nHuman Rights Laws as closely as possible. The language in this License\r\nshall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or\r\nagainst any party.\r\n* Disclaimer.
