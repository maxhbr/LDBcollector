You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n+parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n+the Program or works based on it.\n+\n+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n+this License.\n+\n+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n+impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\f\n+  8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\n+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n+later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.\n+\n+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n+\n+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  12.
