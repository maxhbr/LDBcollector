Definitions\r\n\r\n   a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue,\r\n      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in\r\n      unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,\r\n      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are\r\n      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\r\n      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\r\n      defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\r\n   b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the\r\n      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\r\n      musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion\r\n      picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,\r\n      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,\r\n      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a\r\n      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the\r\n      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the\r\n      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the\r\n      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving\r\n      image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the\r\n      purpose of this License.\r\n\r\n   c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work\r\n      under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\r\n\r\n   e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under\r\n      the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\r\n      License who has not previously violated the terms of this\r\n      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express\r\n      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this\r\n      License despite a previous violation.\r\n\r\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,\r\n   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or\r\n   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner\r\n   under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\r\n   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\r\n   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated\r\n   below:\r\n\r\n   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\r\n      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in\r\n      the Collective Works;\r\n\r\n   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\r\n\r\n   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,\r\n      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital\r\n      audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in\r\n      Collective Works;\r\n\r\n   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,\r\n      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital\r\n      audio transmission Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n   e.\r\n\r\n      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\r\n\r\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor\r\n            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether\r\n            individually or via a performance rights society\r\n            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public\r\n            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)\r\n            of the Work.\r\n\r\n        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives\r\n            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or\r\n            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry\r\n            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from\r\n            the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the\r\n            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US\r\n            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\n\r\n   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of\r\n      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the\r\n      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\r\n      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for\r\n      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,\r\n      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114\r\n      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other\r\n      jurisdictions).\r\n\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\r\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\r\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\r\nin other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by\r\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\r\n   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\r\n      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this\r\n      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\n      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of\r\n      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\r\n      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any\r\n      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this\r\n      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\r\n      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\r\n      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\r\n      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\r\n      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any\r\n      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in\r\n      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\r\n      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\r\n      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\r\n      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\r\n      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\r\n      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\r\n      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\r\n      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\r\n      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\r\n      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\r\n      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\r\n\r\n   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\r\n      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or\r\n      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for\r\n      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\r\n      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\r\n      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\r\n      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\r\n      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\r\n      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\r\n      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\r\n      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\r\n      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\r\n      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\r\n      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\r\n      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\r\n      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\r\n      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\r\n      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\r\n      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\r\nLICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\r\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\r\nSTATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\r\nTITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\r\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\r\n   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\r\n   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\r\n   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\r\n   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n   DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\r\n      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\r\n      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\r\n      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\r\n      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\r\n      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\r\n      termination of this License.\r\n\r\n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\r\n      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\r\n      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the\r\n      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\r\n      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\r\n      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\r\n      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\r\n      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\r\n      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work\r\n      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\r\n      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\r\n      license granted to You under this License.\r\n\r\n   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\r\n      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\r\n      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the\r\n      license granted to You under this License.\r\n\r\n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\r\n      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\r\n      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\r\n      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\r\n      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\r\n      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\r\n      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\r\n      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver\r\n      or consent.\r\n\r\n   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\r\n      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\r\n      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\r\n      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\r\n      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\r\n      You.
