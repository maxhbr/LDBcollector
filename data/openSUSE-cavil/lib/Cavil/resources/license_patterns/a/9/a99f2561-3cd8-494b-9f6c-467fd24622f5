{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LPPL-1.3c","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The LATEX Project Public License, Version 1.3c 2006-05-20\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe LATEX Project Public License (lppl) is the primary license under which the LATEX kernel and the base\r\nLATEX packages are distributed.\r\nYou may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute.\r\nThis license may be particularly suitable if your work is TEX-related (such as a LATEX package), but it is\r\nwritten in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TEX.\r\nThe section ‘whether and how to distribute works under this license’, below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this\r\nlicense.\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions\r\nunder which modified versions of that work may be distributed.\r\nWe, the LATEX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute\r\nmodified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document ‘cfgguide.tex’ and ‘modguide.tex’ in the base LATEX\r\ndistribution for suggestions.\r\n9.3.2\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n97\r\n\r\n\fWork Any work being distributed under this License.\r\nDerived Work Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\nModification Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law – for example, the\r\nproduction of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such\r\na file, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\nModify To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.\r\nDistribution Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file\r\ntransfer protocols such as ftp or http or by shared file systems such as Sun’s Network File System\r\n(nfs).\r\nCompiled Work A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on\r\na computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\r\ntransformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that\r\nmodification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\nCurrent Maintainer A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit\r\nnomination then it is the ‘Copyright Holder’ under any applicable law.\r\nBase Interpreter A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the\r\nwhole of the Work.\r\nA Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the\r\nBase Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\ninteractively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable\r\nBase Interpreter is a ‘LATEX-Format’ or in the case of files belonging to the ‘LATEX-format’ a program\r\nimplementing the ‘TEX language’.\r\n9.3.3\r\n\r\nConditions on Distribution and Modification\r\n\r\n1. Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they\r\nare outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements\r\nare made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only\r\npart of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of\r\nthe Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a\r\nway that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been\r\ninstalled if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.\r\n4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus\r\ncreating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the\r\nCurrent Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.\r\n5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus\r\ncreating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled\r\nWork based on the Derived Work.\r\n6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the\r\nfollowing conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in\r\nthe copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to\r\nadd such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\r\n\r\n98\r\n\r\n\f(a) If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when\r\nthat component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\nidentifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement\r\ncomponent of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\nof this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.\r\n(b) Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the\r\nchanges to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of\r\nthe Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.\r\n(c) No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the\r\nauthors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\nthe reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have\r\nstated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n(d) You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\ni. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component\r\nis made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then\r\noffering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\ncondition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the\r\nmodified component;\r\nii. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.\r\n7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated\r\nfrom a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.\r\n8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by\r\nany method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component\r\nof the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived\r\nWork (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax\r\nor nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.\r\n10. (a) A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors\r\nthe conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor\r\nthe rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n(b) If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the\r\nrestrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place\r\nany restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.\r\n12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties\r\nwith all applicable laws.\r\n9.3.4\r\n\r\nNo Warranty\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides\r\nthe Work ‘as is’, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to,\r\nthe implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the\r\nquality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of\r\nall necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\r\nany author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and\/or modify\r\nthe Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\r\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but\r\nnot limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any\r\nfailure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said\r\nother party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n99\r\n\r\n\f9.3.5\r\n\r\nMaintenance of The Work\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status ‘author-maintained’ if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near\r\nthe primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that it is ‘author-maintained’.\r\nThe Work has the status ‘maintained’ if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work\r\nthat they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address).\r\nIt is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.\r\nThe Work changes from status ‘maintained’ to ‘unmaintained’ if there is no Current Maintainer, or the\r\nperson stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of\r\ncommunication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer\r\nto take over this role.\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following\r\nsteps:\r\n1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two\r\ndiffer) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\r\n2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.\r\n(a) If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data\r\nwithin one month.\r\n(b) If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over\r\nmaintenance. (If the Work is a LATEX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to\r\ncomp.text.tex.)\r\n3. (a) If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then\r\nthis takes effect immediately upon announcement.\r\n(b) If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of\r\nthe Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\r\n4. If you make an ‘intention announcement’ as described in 2b above and after three months your intention\r\nis challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then\r\nyou may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\n5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of\r\na change completed under the terms of 3b or 4, then that Current Maintainer must become or remain\r\nthe Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one\r\nmonth.\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the\r\nlppl license.\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work,\r\na prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce\r\nyour new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b above.\r\n9.3.6\r\n\r\nWhether and How to Distribute Works under This License\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as ‘you’ in this section.\r\n9.3.7\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from\r\nthose in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your\r\nwork under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your\r\nlicense should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the\r\nlppl.\r\nThe document ‘modguide.tex’ in the base LATEX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LATEX under the gnu General Public\r\n100\r\n\r\n\fLicense (gpl) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LATEX, the discussion in\r\n‘modguide.tex’ may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are\r\nencouraged to read it.\r\n9.3.8\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the\r\nabove conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications\r\nwill never be distributed, often this will happen by accident – you may forget that you have modified that\r\ncomponent; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are\r\nthus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications\r\nand, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy\r\nof the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\r\n9.3.9\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including\r\nyour name and the year the work was authored and\/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement\r\nthat the distribution and\/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n%% pig.dtx\r\n%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\r\n%\r\n% This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n% of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n% The latest version of this license is in","risk":3,"spdx":"LPPL-1.3c","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a99f2561-3cd8-494b-9f6c-467fd24622f5"}
