{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-Unspecified","packname":"pspp","patent":0,"pattern":"you want it, that you can change these programs or use pieces of them in\nnew free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of PSPP, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for PSPP.  If these programs are\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know\nthat what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n   The precise conditions of the license for PSPP are found in the GNU\nGeneral Public License.
