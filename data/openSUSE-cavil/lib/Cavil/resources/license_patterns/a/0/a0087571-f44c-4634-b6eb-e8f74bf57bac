{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.3","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"GNU Free Documentation License\r\nVersion 1.3, 3 November 2008\r\nCopyright Â© 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \r\n<http:\/\/fsf.org\/>\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license \r\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n=== 0. PREAMBLE\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional \r\nand useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the \r\neffective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, \r\neither commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for \r\nthe author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being \r\nconsidered responsible for modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the \r\ndocument must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU \r\nGeneral Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, \r\nbecause free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with \r\nmanuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is \r\nnot limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, \r\nregardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We \r\nrecommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or \r\nreference.\r\n\r\n=== 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains \r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the \r\nterms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, \r\nunlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \r\n\"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public \r\nis a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, \r\nmodify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or \r\na portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or \r\ntranslated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the \r\nDocument that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or \r\nauthors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related \r\nmatters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall \r\nsubject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a \r\nSecondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a \r\nmatter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of \r\nlegal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are \r\ndesignated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that \r\nthe Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the \r\nabove definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as \r\nInvariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document \r\ndoes not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as \r\nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the \r\nDocument is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 \r\nwords, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented \r\nin a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is \r\nsuitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors \r\nor (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) \r\nsome widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text \r\nformatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for \r\ninput to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format \r\nwhose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage \r\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not \r\nTransparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \r\n\"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without \r\nmarkup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly \r\navailable DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed \r\nfor human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF \r\nand JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited \r\nonly by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or \r\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, \r\nPostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such \r\nfollowing pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License \r\nrequires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have \r\nany title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent \r\nappearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the \r\nDocument to the public.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title \r\neither is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that \r\ntranslates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section \r\nname mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \r\n\"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when \r\nyou modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" \r\naccording to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states \r\nthat this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are \r\nconsidered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards \r\ndisclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers \r\nmay have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n=== 2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or \r\nnoncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the \r\nlicense notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in \r\nall copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this \r\nLicense. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading \r\nor further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may \r\naccept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough \r\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may \r\npublicly display copies.\r\n\r\n=== 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed \r\ncovers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license \r\nnotice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, \r\nclearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front \r\ncover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly \r\nand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must \r\npresent the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and \r\nvisible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with \r\nchanges limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the \r\nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in \r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you \r\nshould put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual \r\ncover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than \r\n100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with \r\neach Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network \r\nlocation from which the general network-using public has access to download \r\nusing public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the \r\nDocument, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take \r\nreasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in \r\nquantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at \r\nthe stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute \r\nan Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition \r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document \r\nwell before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to \r\nprovide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n=== 4. MODIFICATIONS\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the \r\nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified \r\nVersion under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the \r\nrole of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the \r\nModified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do \r\nthese things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that \r\nof the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there \r\nwere any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the \r\nsame title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version \r\ngives permission. \r\n\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities \r\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, \r\ntogether with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of \r\nits principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from \r\nthis requirement. \r\n\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, \r\nas the publisher. \r\n\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. \r\n\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the \r\nother copyright notices. \r\n\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving \r\nthe public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this \r\nLicense, in the form shown in the Addendum below. \r\n\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and \r\nrequired Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. \r\n\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License. \r\n\r\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it \r\nan item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the \r\nModified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \r\n\"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and \r\npublisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item \r\ndescribing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. \r\n\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public \r\naccess to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network \r\nlocations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These \r\nmay be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a \r\nwork that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if \r\nthe original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. \r\n\r\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the \r\nTitle of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of \r\neach of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein. \r\n\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text \r\nand in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part \r\nof the section titles. \r\n\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be \r\nincluded in the Modified Version. \r\n\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to \r\nconflict in title with any Invariant Section. \r\n\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. \r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that \r\nqualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, \r\nyou may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To \r\ndo this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified \r\nVersion's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section \r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but \r\nendorsements of your Modified Version by various partiesâfor example, \r\nstatements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization \r\nas the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage \r\nof up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts \r\nin the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of \r\nBack-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one \r\nentity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, \r\npreviously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are \r\nacting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, \r\non explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give \r\npermission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply \r\nendorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n=== 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, \r\nunder the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that \r\nyou include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the \r\noriginal documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your \r\ncombined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty \r\nDisclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple \r\nidentical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are \r\nmultiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the \r\ntitle of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, \r\nthe name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else \r\na unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of \r\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the \r\nvarious original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise \r\ncombine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \r\n\"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\r\n\r\n=== 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents \r\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License \r\nin the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, \r\nprovided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each \r\nof the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it \r\nindividually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License \r\ninto the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects \r\nregarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n=== 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and \r\nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution \r\nmedium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the \r\ncompilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users \r\nbeyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an \r\naggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate \r\nwhich are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the \r\nDocument, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, \r\nthe Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document \r\nwithin the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is \r\nin electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket \r\nthe whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n=== 8. TRANSLATION\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute \r\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant \r\nSections with translations requires special permission from their copyright \r\nholders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in \r\naddition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include \r\na translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and \r\nany Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English \r\nversion of this License and the original versions of those notices and \r\ndisclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original \r\nversion of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will \r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \r\n\"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will \r\ntypically require changing the actual title.\r\n\r\n=== 9. TERMINATION\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as \r\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, \r\nsublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your \r\nrights under this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a \r\nparticular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until \r\nthe copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) \r\npermanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by \r\nsome reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \r\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some \r\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation \r\nof this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the \r\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses \r\nof parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If \r\nyour rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a \r\ncopy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n=== 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free \r\nDocumentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in \r\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \r\nor concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the \r\nDocument specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any \r\nlater version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and \r\nconditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has \r\nbeen published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the \r\nDocument does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any \r\nversion ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the \r\nDocument specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this \r\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version \r\npermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\r\n\r\n=== 11. RELICENSING\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide \r\nWeb server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent \r\nfacilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit \r\nis an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \r\n\"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus \r\npublished on the MMC site.\r\n\r\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license \r\npublished by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a \r\nprincipal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future \r\ncopyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.\r\n\r\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as \r\npart of another Document.\r\n\r\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and \r\nif all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than \r\nthis MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) \r\nhad no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior \r\nto November 1, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under \r\nCC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC \r\nis eligible for relicensing","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a0087571-f44c-4634-b6eb-e8f74bf57bac"}
