You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\n     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\n     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\n     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer\n     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\n     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you\n     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to\n     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\n     Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n\n  4.
