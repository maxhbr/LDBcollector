{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-3.0+","packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"7. Additional Terms.\n\n\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n\n    authors of the material; or\n\n\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\n\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n\nthis License.\n\n\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n\npatent against the party.\n\n\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n\nwork and works based on it.\n\n\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n\ncombination as such.\n\n\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\n\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\n\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n\nlater version.\n\n\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n\nHOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS\n\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\n\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n\n\n    {{ project }}  Copyright (C) {{ year }}  {{ organization }}\n\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n\n<http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\n\n\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n\nPublic License instead of this License.
