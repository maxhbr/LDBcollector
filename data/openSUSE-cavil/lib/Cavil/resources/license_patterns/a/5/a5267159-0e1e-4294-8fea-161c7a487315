It also counts<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> the version number 2.1.]<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">                Preamble<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">these things.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">introduced by others.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">libraries into non-free programs.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">special circumstances.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">system.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that program using a modified version of the Library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">be combined with the library in order to run.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and\/or data<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and installation of the library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and what the program that uses the Library does.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">fee.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    in the event an application does not supply such function or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    its purpose remains meaningful.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    root function must still compute square roots.)<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">it.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">collective works based on the Library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the scope of this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">these notices.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Library into a program that is not a library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">medium customarily used for software interchange.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library will still fall under Section 6.)<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">engineering for debugging such modifications.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">of these things:<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and\/or source code, so that the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    to use the modified definitions.)<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    least three years, to give the same user the materials<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    than the cost of performing this distribution.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    specified materials from the same place.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the executable.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    Sections above.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Library or works based on it.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">integrity of the free software distribution system which is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">impose that choice.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">be a consequence of the rest of this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">written in the body of this License.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">the Free Software Foundation.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">and reuse of software generally.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">                NO WARRANTY<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">DAMAGES.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">ordinary General Public License).<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\"> <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"line\">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
