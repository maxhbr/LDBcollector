By contrast, the GNU General Public\n\n17      \n\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n\n18      \n\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n19      \n\n20      \n\n This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n\n21      \n\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n\n22      \n\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n\n23      \n\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n\n24      \n\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n\n25      \n\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n26      \n\n27      \n\n When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n\n28      \n\nnot price.
