This price is for 6 CDs full of free Software,\none DVD which contains the same stuff again for convenience, about\n1000 pages of printed manuals, and 90 days installation support via\ntelephone, e-mail or fax.\n\nI think 56 Dollar is rather cheap for all that, and basically this\nprice is for the support and the printed manuals. So in my point of\nview the CDs actually cost practically nothing apart from a handling\ncharge.  And the price of the whole package won't rise a single penny\nby including the CID-keyed fonts.  And the contents of the CDs can be\ndownloaded freely via ftp, if one has no need for the support or the\nprinted manuals.\n\nMost software on these CDs is free software and can be copied and\nredistributed without limitations. This would of course include\nthe CIDFonts.\n\nThe CDs contain some software which is not completely free, for\nexample shareware. So it is probably not allowed to redistribute\ncopies of the complete set of CDs. But of course all the free software\ncontained can be redistributed.\n\nThe CDs also contain the SuSE installation and administration program\nYaST, which unfortunately does not qualify as completely free\nsoftware. The license of YaST basically says that you are allowed to\nredistribute it, modified or unmodified, but you are not allowed to\ncharge anything for YaST unless you get permission by SuSE to charge\nsomething for YaST. So YaST's license is a little bit weird.\n\nHere is the full license of YaST:\n\n[2. application\/octet-stream; COPYRIGHT.yast]...\n\n\nSo certainly it is no problem to redistribute the CIDFonts from the\nSuSE CDs, although there may be some stuff on the SuSE CDs which\ncannot easily be redistributed. The huge majority of the packages on\nthe SuSE CDs is free software (GPL, BSD, X11 or some other free\nsoftware license). Only very few packages have some shareware or other\nnon free license, but the existence of such non free packages on the\nCDs might cause Problems in redistributing the complete CD set as is,\ni.e. without removing the non free stuff.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the CIDFonts remain free if we include\nthem on the SuSE CDs.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMike","risk":4,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a2017990-2ea5-495d-9170-c865c524f083"}
