notes = '''
There are two versions of this license.  1) Up to 2006, Metasploit was under a
non-free license, originally found at:
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/documentation/LICENSE but that URL is
gone. A copy of that version from archive.org has been preserved here for
reference.  2) At some point in 2006, Metasploit's Framework License switched to
3-clause BSD, which is Free and GPL-compatible. It is noteworthy that the
license text also tracks and includes the licensing for all of the bundled
components within Metasploit. A copy of this license was taken from
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/LICENSE on May 9,
2014.
