# LicenseLynx

In today's software development landscape, managing licenses across various projects can be a daunting task.
Different projects often refer to the same license in multiple ways, leading to confusion and potential legal risks.  
LicenseLynx aims to solve this problem by bridging the gap between unknown or ambiguous license names and their canonical license names.
Additionally, we offer libraries for Python, Java, and TypeScript to streamline the process of mapping licenses to their canonical names,  
typically represented by SPDX IDs.
