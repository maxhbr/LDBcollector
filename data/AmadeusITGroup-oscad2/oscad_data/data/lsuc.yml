        It is a good practice of the open source community to let the copyright message
        that is shown by the running program also state that it contains components
        licensed under the BSD license. Because you are embedding this snimoli into
        a larger software unit, you are developing this larger unit. Hence, you can
        also expand the copyright notice of this larger unit by such a hint to its
        BSD components.

        Arrange your binary distribution so that the licensing elements (particularly,
        the BSD license text, the copyright notice of the original author(s), and
        the BSD disclaimer) clearly refer only to the embedded library and do not
        affect the licensing of your own overarching work. It's a good tradition to
        keep the embedded components like libraries, modules, snippets, or plugins
        in separate directories, which also contains all their licensing elements.

        It is a good practice of the open source community to let the copyright notice,
        which is shown by the running program, also state that the program uses a
        component licensed under the PHP-3.0 license. So, let the copyright screen
        of the enclosing program <em>reproduce</em> the complete PHP-3.0 license including
        the copyright notice, the PHP-3.0 conditions, and the PHP-3.0 disclaimer (as
        it is required for binary distributions.)

        Arrange your source code distribution so that the licensing elements (especially
        the PHP-3.0 license text, the specific copyright notice of the original author(s),
        and the PHP-3.0 disclaimer) clearly refer only to the embedded library and
        do not affect the licensing of your own overarching work. It's a good tradition
        to keep embedded components like libraries, modules, snippets, or plugins
        in separate directories, which contain also all additional licensing elements.
