The Source\nCode version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms\nof this License, and You must include a copy of this License with\nevery copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or\nimpose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts\nthe applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\nhereunder.

Availability of Source Code.\nAny Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source\nCode form under the terms of this License either on the same media as\nan Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4.

Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\nCode, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where\nYou describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You\ncreated one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not\npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\nits structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such\nas a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version does\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source\nCode version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\nevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\nthe code they affect.
