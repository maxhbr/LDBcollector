DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS\n\n3.1. Application of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\n    include an additional document offering the additional rights\n    described in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n    \n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n    via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n    you made an Executable version available and to the Initial\n    Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n    after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n    months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n    ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n    Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n    You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the\n    Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is\n    provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may\n    provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to\n    be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification\n    available and to notify the Initial Developer.\n    (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code\n    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n    that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from\n    Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the\n    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\n    notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n    You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual\n        property right in particular functionality or code (or its\n        utilization under this License), you must include a text file\n        with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes\n        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such\n        knowledge after You make Your Modification available as\n        described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL\n        file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take\n        other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\n        newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n        the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n        You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to\n        implement that API, you must also include this information in\n        the LEGAL file.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered\n    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\n    name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\n    put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as\n    a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\n    such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n    recipients of Covered Code.\n\n    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\n    included in any notice in an Executable version, related\n    documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights\n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n    version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may\n    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for\n    the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\n    terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not\n    by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\n    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that\nprohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\nin the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must\nsubmit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able\nuse the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red\nHat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\nthe notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license\nsuch additional products on different terms from those contained in this\nLicense.\n\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red\nHat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may\nlicense Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in\nthis License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms\navailable.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from\n    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n    number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the\n    terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat.\n    No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms\n    applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and\n    subsequent Licenses.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Red Hat\", \"RHEPL\" or\n    any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your\n    license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the\n    license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public\n    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n    Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not\n    of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\nOR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION\nAND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS\n\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\"\nand \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used\nin 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS\n\n3.1. Application of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\n    include an additional document offering the additional rights\n    described in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n    \n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n    via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n    you made an Executable version available and to the Initial\n    Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n    after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n    months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n    ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n    Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n    You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the\n    Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is\n    provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may\n    provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to\n    be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification\n    available and to notify the Initial Developer.\n    (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code\n    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n    that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from\n    Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the\n    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\n    notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n    You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual\n        property right in particular functionality or code (or its\n        utilization under this License), you must include a text file\n        with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes\n        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such\n        knowledge after You make Your Modification available as\n        described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL\n        file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take\n        other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\n        newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n        the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n        You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to\n        implement that API, you must also include this information in\n        the LEGAL file.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered\n    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\n    name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\n    put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as\n    a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\n    such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n    recipients of Covered Code.\n\n    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\n    included in any notice in an Executable version, related\n    documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights\n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n    version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may\n    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for\n    the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\n    terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not\n    by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\n    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that\nprohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\nin the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must\nsubmit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able\nuse the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red\nHat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\nthe notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license\nsuch additional products on different terms from those contained in this\nLicense.\n\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red\nHat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may\nlicense Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in\nthis License.

New Versions.\n\n    Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from\n    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n    number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the\n    terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat.\n    No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms\n    applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and\n    subsequent Licenses.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Red Hat\", \"RHEPL\" or\n    any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your\n    license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the\n    license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public\n    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n    Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not\n    of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may\n    provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to\n    be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification\n    available and to notify the Initial Developer.\n    (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code\n    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n    that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from\n    Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the\n    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\n    notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n    You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual\n        property right in particular functionality or code (or its\n        utilization under this License), you must include a text file\n        with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes\n        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such\n        knowledge after You make Your Modification available as\n        described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL\n        file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take\n        other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\n        newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n        the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n        You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to\n        implement that API, you must also include this information in\n        the LEGAL file.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered\n    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\n    name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\n    put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as\n    a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\n    such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n    recipients of Covered Code.\n\n    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\n    included in any notice in an Executable version, related\n    documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights\n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n    version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may\n    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for\n    the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\n    terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not\n    by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\n    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that\nprohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\nin the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must\nsubmit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able\nuse the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red\nHat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\nthe notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license\nsuch additional products on different terms from those contained in this\nLicense.\n\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red\nHat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may\nlicense Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in\nthis License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms\navailable.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from\n    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n    number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the\n    terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat.\n    No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms\n    applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and\n    subsequent Licenses.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Red Hat\", \"RHEPL\" or\n    any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your\n    license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the\n    license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public\n    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n    Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not\n    of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.
