For the avoidance of\ndoubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the\nsynchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\n(\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of\nthis License.\n\n\"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\nterms of this License.\n\n\"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n\n\"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the\nterms of this License.\n\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\nwho has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect\nto the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 2.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6.
