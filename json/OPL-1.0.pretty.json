If it is not \npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then \nyou must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a \nuser would be likely to look for such a notice.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such \nParticipant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such \nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such \nParticipant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the \namount or value of any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \nYou or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER \nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE \nINITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF \nCOVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE \nTO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, \nOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT \nLIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, \nCOMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER \nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE \nBEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
