Provisions which, by their nature, should remain\n   in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n   including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and\n   13.  Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation,\n   indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n   this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this\n   License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of\n   either party.\n\n13.  Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Export Law Assurances.

Failure by Apple to enforce any provision\n   of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement\n   of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which\n   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\n   the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.6 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n   jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n   thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be\n   enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n   economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n   this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n   restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n   Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n   those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n   must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n   destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n13.7 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n   between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in\n   the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby\n   consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n   and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n   License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n   excluded.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the\n   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n   matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n   United States and the State of California, except that body of\n   California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les\nparties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents\nconnexes soient rediges en anglais.\n\nEXHIBIT A. \n\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1999 Apple Computer, Inc.  All Rights\nReserved.
