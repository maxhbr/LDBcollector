This Section \n4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.\n\nSection 5.\tTermination of Rights\n\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) \nautomatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with \nrespect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this \nLicense shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming \naware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are \nproperly granted shall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6.\tOther Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of \nthe Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.  You agree not to remove, \nalter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. \n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. \nimport/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other \nsimilar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a \nprovision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any \nthird party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property \ninfringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of \nthis License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot \ndistribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other \nconditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, \nyou could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain \nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already \ndistributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to \ninform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable \nstep to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. \n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of \nany provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.  In \nsubstitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the \noriginal intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended \nlicense will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted.

This License does not apply to portions of an \nAggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of \"Program\" provided in this \nLicense. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program \ncontained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License.  Also, should the Program \nbe extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program \napart from the Aggregate Work.\n\nSection 4.\tLicense Grant\n\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees \nhereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-\nfree, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, \nenhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works \nbased on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section \n4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.\n\nSection 5.\tTermination of Rights\n\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) \nautomatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with \nrespect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this \nLicense shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming \naware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are \nproperly granted shall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6.\tOther Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of \nthe Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.  You agree not to remove, \nalter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. \n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. \nimport/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other \nsimilar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a \nprovision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any \nthird party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property \ninfringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of \nthis License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot \ndistribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other \nconditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, \nyou could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain \nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already \ndistributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to \ninform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable \nstep to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. \n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of \nany provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.  In \nsubstitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the \noriginal intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended \nlicense will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License \ngrants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the \nintellectual property of any Contributor.\n\n\t\tThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the \nparties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of \nthe parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \nOhio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.","__impliedURLs":[["SPDX","http://spdx.org/licenses/OCLC-2.0.json"],[null,"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/software/license/v2final.htm"],[null,"https://opensource.org/licenses/OCLC-2.0"],["Homepage","http://opensource.org/licenses/oclc2.php"],["OSI Page","http://opensource.org/licenses/oclc2.php"],[null,"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/OCLC-2.0"],["OSI Page","https://opensource.org/licenses/OCLC-2.0"]]}
