You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.\n3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.

If you use our work, you ought to\nacknowledge us.\n\nPermission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\nin advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\nit.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's\nsoftware\".\n\nWe specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\ncommercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\nassumed by the product vendor.\n\n\nansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\nsole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\nansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\nby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\nthat you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file\nansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\nof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\nthe foregoing paragraphs do.\n\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\nltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\nby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\n\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\npatents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\nlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\nsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\nHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\nSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\ncode.\n\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\nbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\n\"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\nresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\nGIF decoders.\n\nWe are required to state that\n    \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.\"",
