Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor \nretains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such \nContributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the \nOriginal Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase (\"Sybase \nModifications\"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically \nsubject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to \nlicense such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms \nfrom those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at \nall.\n\n12.

Upon termination, You agree to immediately \nstop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and \ndistribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered \nCode that are in your possession or control.

Provisions which, by their nature, should \nremain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, \nincluding but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No \nparty will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages \nof any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance \nwith its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice \nto any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n13. Miscellaneous.\n\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as \ndefined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the \nCovered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public \nas defined in this License.

Nothing in this License will impair Sybase's \nor any Contributor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop \nfor it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the \nsame or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, \nLarger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market \nor distribute.\n\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce \nany provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future \nenforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which \nprovides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the \ndrafter will not apply to this License.\n\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction \nfinds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be \nunenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum \nextent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the \nparties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and \neffect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or \nrestricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 \nand/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this \nLicense will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any \nuse of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your \npossession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between \nYou and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern \nDistrict of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal \njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that \nDistrict with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations \nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly \nexcluded.\n\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire \nagreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. \nThis License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the \nState of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts \nof law.
