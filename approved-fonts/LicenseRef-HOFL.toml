notes = '''
The Hack Open Font License is a weird mix of the Bitstream Vera and SIL Open
Font licenses. It has the common "must be renamed if modified" and "must not be
sold by itself" clauses that are found in font licenses. These clauses might
make a software license non-free (though, the first one seems to be acceptable
by the FSF in some cases), but they have been considered acceptable for FOSS
font licensing for some time now. It is worth noting that the Hack font upstream
(the origination of this license) feels that the "sold by itself" clause can be
trivially circumvented and has no issue with people doing that (e.g. font comes
with a helloworld binary).
