notes = '''
This license was found on the "ec" component in TeXLive. Originally, it was non-
free, but the copyright holders agreed to drop a clause requiring distribution
of the "unmodified fonts" in the event of modification. Even with this change,
this license is considered to be on the "borderline" of Free, and it is not
recommended for use.
