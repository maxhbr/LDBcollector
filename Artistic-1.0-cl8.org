** Comments on (easy) usability

- *↑* Do note that the Artistic License is considered non-free by the
  FSF. They suggest to use the Clarified Artistic License (also called
  Artistic License 2.0) instead. However, the original Artistic License
  is still considered DFSG-free. (source:
  [[https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses][Debian Free Software
  Guidelines]])

- *↑* Is OSI Approved (source:
  [[https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0-cl8.html][SPDX]])

- *↓* Rating is: Lead (source:
