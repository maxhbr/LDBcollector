(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, 
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original 
Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger 
Work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, 
to make, have made, use and sell (&quot;offer to sell and import&quot;) the Original 
Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is 
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions 
thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further 
Modifications or combinations.

2.2. Contributor Grant.
Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, 
subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, 
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an 
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a 
Larger Work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to 
make, have made, use and sell (&quot;offer to sell and import&quot;) the Contributor 
Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is 
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or 
portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to 
Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the 
terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code 
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a 
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not 
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You 
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in 
Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source 
Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an 
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone 
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) 
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a 
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such 
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of 
the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific 
license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may 
provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made 
available.

3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of 
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, 
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and 
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any 
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the 
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in 
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must 
include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which 
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You 
make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall 
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter 
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) 
above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s 
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this 
License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; 
rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may 
add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not 
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a 
user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge 
a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients 
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of 
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice 
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the 
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice 
in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you 
distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the 
notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the 
product.

3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect 
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) 
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite 
all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this 
license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.
6.1. New Versions.
License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be 
submitted to opensource.org for certification.
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.
If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the 
required Devloper Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do 
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this 
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;OpenPL&quot;, 
&quot;OPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ 
from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be 
deemed to be modifications of this License.)

6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in 
the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

[1] A Developer specific license.

[2] The contents of this file OPL.html, stating the general licensing policy of 
the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-
numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE 
OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY 
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER. 

8. TERMINATION. 
8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail 
to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly 
granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, 
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
8.2. Termination Upon Litigation.
If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or 
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action 
is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

(a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from 
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by 
such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the 
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon 
in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights 
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically 
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights 
granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are 
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or 
had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 
Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license 
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by 
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF 
COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION 
OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial 
computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with 
only those rights set forth herein. 
11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the 
corresponding addendum described above.
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You 
are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of 
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made 
available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer 
responsibility on an equitable basis.
