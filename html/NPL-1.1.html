IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation. 
Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape&#39;s Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making such third party code available under this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be considered &#39;&#39;Modifications&#39;&#39; under this License.

V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.

V.1. In General. 
The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.
V.2. Other Products. 
Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape&#39;s Branded Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following the release date of the Original Code, without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.

V.3. Alternative Licensing. 
Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape&#39;s Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License. 
 

VI. Litigation.

The Source Code version of \n    Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of \n    this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version \n    of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \n\n    3.2. Availability of Source Code. \n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as \n    an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via \n    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months \n    after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version \n    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \n\n    3.3. Description of Modifications. \n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must \n    include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of \n    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of \n    the Covered Code. \n\n    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters \n\n        (a) Third Party Claims. \n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 \n        or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that \n        a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly \n        modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) \n        reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \n\n        (b) Contributor APIs. \n        If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement \n        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \n\n        (c) Representations. \n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) \n        and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n    3.5. Required Notices. \n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, \n    then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more \n    Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code \n    where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or \n    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \n    You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify \n    the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms \n    You offer. \n\n    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that \n    the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of \n    Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights \n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different \n    from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter \n    the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it \n    absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify \n    the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \n\n    3.7. Larger Works. \n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. \n    In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License. \n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License. \n\n    6.1. New Versions. \n    Netscape Communications Corporation (&#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing \n    version number. \n\n    6.2. Effect of New Versions. \n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use \n    such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to \n    Covered Code created under this License. \n\n    6.3. Derivative Works. \n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must \n    (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &#39;&#39;Mozilla&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZILLAPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;, \&quot;MPL\&quot;, &#39;&#39;NPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license \n    (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from \n    the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of \n    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION. \n\n    8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming \n    aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain \n    in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n\n    8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or \n    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that: \n\n        (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under \n        Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: \n       (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw \n        Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement \n        are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 \n        automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \n\n        (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by \n        such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by \n        that Participant. \n\n    8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim \n    is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant \n    under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \n\n    8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \n    You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\nThe Covered Code is a &#39;&#39;commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#39;&#39;commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \n\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \&quot;Multiple-Licensed\&quot;. \&quot;Multiple-Licensed\&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License. \n\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \&quot;License\&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Distribution Obligations. \n\n    3.1. Application of License. \n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of \n    Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of \n    this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version \n    of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \n\n    3.2. Availability of Source Code. \n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as \n    an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via \n    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months \n    after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version \n    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \n\n    3.3. Description of Modifications. \n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must \n    include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of \n    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of \n    the Covered Code. \n\n    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters \n\n        (a) Third Party Claims. \n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 \n        or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \&quot;LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that \n        a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly \n        modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) \n        reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \n\n        (b) Contributor APIs. \n        If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement \n        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \n\n        (c) Representations. \n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) \n        and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n    3.5. Required Notices. \n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, \n    then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more \n    Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code \n    where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or \n    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. \n    You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify \n    the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms \n    You offer. \n\n    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that \n    the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of \n    Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights \n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different \n    from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter \n    the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it \n    absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify \n    the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \n\n    3.7. Larger Works. \n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. \n    In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License. \n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License. \n\n    6.1. New Versions. \n    Netscape Communications Corporation (&#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing \n    version number. \n\n    6.2. Effect of New Versions. \n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use \n    such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to \n    Covered Code created under this License. \n\n    6.3. Derivative Works. \n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must \n    (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &#39;&#39;Mozilla&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZILLAPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;, \&quot;MPL\&quot;, &#39;&#39;NPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license \n    (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from \n    the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of \n    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION. \n\n    8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming \n    aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain \n    in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n\n    8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or \n    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging that: \n\n        (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under \n        Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: \n       (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw \n        Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement \n        are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 \n        automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \n\n        (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by \n        such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by \n        that Participant. \n\n    8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim \n    is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant \n    under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \n\n    8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by \n    You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\nThe Covered Code is a &#39;&#39;commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#39;&#39;commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \n\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \&quot;Multiple-Licensed\&quot;. \&quot;Multiple-Licensed\&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License. \n\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \&quot;License\&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation. \nPrior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape&#39;s Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making such third party code available under this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be considered &#39;&#39;Modifications&#39;&#39; under this License.\n\nV. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.\n\nV.1. In General. \nThe obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.\nV.2. Other Products. \nNetscape may include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape&#39;s Branded Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following the release date of the Original Code, without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.\n\nV.3.
