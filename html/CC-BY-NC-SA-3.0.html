    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made

    modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;

rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(d), as requested.
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (&quot;Applicable License&quot;).
    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
    the exchange of copyrighted works.
 d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by
    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of
        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a
        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
        under Section 4(c).
 f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The\n    original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a\n    modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n    in Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\nother media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\ngranted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the\nrights described in Section 4(e).\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(d), as requested.\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)\n    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;).\n    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You\n    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the\n    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the\n    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this\n    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be\n    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with\n    the exchange of copyrighted works.\n d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by\n    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\n        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\n        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\n        under Section 4(c).\n f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS\nAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE\nWORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY\nBE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\nCONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&quot;The\n    original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a\n    modification could indicate \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n    in Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(d), as requested.\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)\n    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;).\n    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You\n    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the\n    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the\n    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this\n    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be\n    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with\n    the exchange of copyrighted works.\n d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by\n    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\n        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\n        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\n        under Section 4(c).\n f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS\nAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE\nWORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

License Grant.\r\n\r\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\n    a.to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce\r\n     the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\r\n\r\n    b.to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation\r\n     in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that\r\n     changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked\r\n     \&quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&quot; or a modification could indicate\r\n     \&quot;The original work has been modified.\&quot;;\r\n\r\n    c.to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\r\n\r\n    d.to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\r\n\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions.\r\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n    a.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must\r\n     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of\r\n     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work\r\n     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise\r\n     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense\r\n     the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\r\n     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You\r\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures\r\n     on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\r\n     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work\r\n     as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work\r\n     itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice\r\n     from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\r\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\r\n     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as\r\n     required by Section 4(d), as requested.\r\n\r\n    b.You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this\r\n     License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License;\r\n     (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\r\n     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\r\n     3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\r\n     every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\r\n     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\r\n     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\r\n     the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\r\n     Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included\r\n     in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform\r\n     the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that\r\n     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted\r\n     to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to\r\n     the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\r\n     from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\r\n\r\n    c.You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner\r\n     that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary\r\n     compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\r\n     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial\r\n     advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\r\n     compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n    d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,\r\n     You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\r\n     notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) \r\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\r\n     Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,\r\n     publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright\r\n     notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)\r\n     the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,\r\n     if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\r\n     the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),\r\n     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\r\n     \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original\r\n     Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\r\n     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\r\n     minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\r\n     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\r\n     as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\r\n     above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert\r\n     or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\r\n     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\r\n     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\n    e.For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n        i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\r\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\r\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\n         of the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\n        ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\r\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,\r\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\r\n         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\r\n         a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\r\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\n         licensing scheme; and,\r\n\r\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether\r\n         individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\r\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\r\n         rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\r\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\r\n\r\n    f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by\r\n     applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\r\n     or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\r\n     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\r\n     Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\r\n     in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\r\n     Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\r\n     action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will\r\n     waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by\r\n     the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\r\n      Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability.\r\n\r\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n    a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach\r\n     by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\r\n     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\r\n     provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\r\n     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n    b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\r\n     of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\r\n     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\r\n     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any\r\n     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\r\n     this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n    a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers\r\n     to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\r\n     to You under this License.\r\n\r\n    b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient\r\n     a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\r\n     under this License.\r\n\r\n    c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall\r\n     not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\r\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n    d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless\r\n     such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\r\n     waiver or consent.\r\n\r\n    e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work\r\n     licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\r\n     the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\n     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\r\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\n    f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing\r\n     the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\r\n     (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of\r\n     1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\r\n     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect\r\n     in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\r\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\r\n     in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\r\n     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\r\n     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\n     license of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\r\n\r\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

(You may not use this license for any purpose other than to create a derivative work, except with the written consent of the licensor or where legally permitted. Where, in some jurisdictions (such as Japan), the exercise of the right to create a derivative work would be deemed to be materially defamatory to the original author, the licensor may, to the extent that the person exercising the right to create the derivative work can exercise to the fullest extent permitted by national law, provide the licensee with a copy of the copyrighted work as required by this License.

The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital\r\n     file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial\r\n     advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary\r\n     compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n    d.If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,\r\n     You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\r\n     notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) \r\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\r\n     Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,\r\n     publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright\r\n     notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)\r\n     the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,\r\n     if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\r\n     the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b),\r\n     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\r\n     \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original\r\n     Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any\r\n     reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a\r\n     minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\r\n     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\r\n     as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out\r\n     above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert\r\n     or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\r\n     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\r\n     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\n    e.For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n        i.Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\r\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\r\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\n         of the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\n        ii.Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right\r\n         to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,\r\n         the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\r\n         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\r\n         a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)\r\n         and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\n         licensing scheme; and,\r\n\r\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether\r\n         individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\r\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\r\n         rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\r\n         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\r\n\r\n    f.Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by\r\n     applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\r\n     or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\r\n     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\r\n     Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\r\n     in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\r\n     Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\r\n     action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will\r\n     waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by\r\n     the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\r\n      Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability.\r\n\r\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n    a.This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach\r\n     by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\r\n     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\r\n     provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\r\n     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n    b.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\r\n     of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\r\n     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\r\n     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any\r\n     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\r\n     this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n    a.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers\r\n     to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\r\n     to You under this License.\r\n\r\n    b.Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient\r\n     a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\r\n     under this License.\r\n\r\n    c.If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall\r\n     not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\r\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n    d.No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless\r\n     such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\r\n     waiver or consent.\r\n\r\n    e.This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work\r\n     licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\r\n     the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\n     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\r\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\n    f.The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing\r\n     the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\r\n     (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of\r\n     1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\r\n     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect\r\n     in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\r\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\r\n     in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\r\n     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\r\n     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\n     license of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(d), as requested.\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)\n    the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (\&quot;Applicable License\&quot;).\n    You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with\n    every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You\n    may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the\n    terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the\n    Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of\n    the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this\n    does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be\n    made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n    or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n    there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with\n    the exchange of copyrighted works.\n d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). The credit required by\n    this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\n        You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\n        such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\n        noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\n        purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\n        under Section 4(c).\n f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS\nAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE\nWORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in\n    compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage\n    guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made\n    available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt,\n    this trademark restriction does not form part of this License.\n\n    Creative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.\n&quot;,
