<pre><code>Lucent Public License Version 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE
(&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

&quot;Contribution&quot; means:

   1. in the case of &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; (&quot;&lt;OWNER&gt;&quot;), the Original Program, and
   2. in the case of each Contributor,
         1. changes to the Program, and

         2. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the
         Program originate from and are &quot;Contributed&quot; by that particular
         Contributor.
     
      A Contribution is &quot;Contributed&quot; by a Contributor only (i) if it was added
      to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
      Contributor&#39;s behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in
      accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or
      additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the
      Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
      conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
      are not derivative works of the Program.

&quot;Contributor&quot; means &lt;OWNER&gt; and any other entity that has Contributed a
Contribution to the Program.

&quot;Distributor&quot; means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to
the Program, or any part thereof.

&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

&quot;Original Program&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this
Agreement as released by &lt;OWNER&gt;, including source code, object code and
documentation, if any.

&quot;Program&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof

&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
   such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

   2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
   Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
   transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
   object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also
   apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the
   Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
   Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply
   to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii)
   Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed
   hereunder.

   3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
   to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
   intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
   any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
   infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
   needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
   allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility
   to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

   4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
   copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
   set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this
Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

   1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

   2. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a
   copy of this Agreement or Distributor&#39;s own license agreement is included
   with each copy of the Program; and

   3. if distributed under Distributor&#39;s own license agreement, such license
   agreement:
   
         1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
         of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits; and

         3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program:

    Copyright (C) &lt;YEAR&gt;, &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; and others. All Rights Reserved. 

C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its
additions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once
consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a
Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Distributor (&quot;Commercial Distributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that
Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Distributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

&lt;OWNER&gt; may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. No one other than &lt;OWNER&gt; has the right to modify this Agreement.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of &lt;STATE&gt; and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.</code></pre>

Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this\nAgreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n   1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n\n   2. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a\n   copy of this Agreement or Distributor&#39;s own license agreement is included\n   with each copy of the Program; and\n\n   3. if distributed under Distributor&#39;s own license agreement, such license\n   agreement:\n   \n         1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions\n         of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of\n         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n         2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n         consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\n\n         3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\n\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the\nProgram:\n\n    Copyright (C) &lt;YEAR&gt;, &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; and others. All Rights Reserved. \n\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its\nadditions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once\nconsent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a\nDistributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nDistributor (\&quot;Commercial Distributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nDistributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to\ncontrol, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\nany such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that\nCommercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\nCommercial Distributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors\nrelated to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\nrights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\nprogram errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\nOUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\na patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\nunder this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\naddition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\nsurvive.\n\n&lt;OWNER&gt; may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from\ntime to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed\nsubject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In\naddition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\nelect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\nversion. No one other than &lt;OWNER&gt; has the right to modify this Agreement.\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\nAgreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights\nin the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of &lt;STATE&gt; and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\nany resulting litigation.&quot;,

DEFINITIONS\n\n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n\n   1. in the case of &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; (\&quot;&lt;OWNER&gt;\&quot;), the Original Program, and\n   2. in the case of each Contributor,\n         1. changes to the Program, and\n\n         2. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the\n         Program originate from and are \&quot;Contributed\&quot; by that particular\n         Contributor.\n     \n      A Contribution is \&quot;Contributed\&quot; by a Contributor only (i) if it was added\n      to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n      Contributor&#39;s behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in\n      accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or\n      additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the\n      Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n      conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)\n      are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means &lt;OWNER&gt; and any other entity that has Contributed a\nContribution to the Program.\n\n\&quot;Distributor\&quot; means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to\nthe Program, or any part thereof.\n\n\&quot;Licensed Patents\&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this\nAgreement as released by &lt;OWNER&gt;, including source code, object code and\ndocumentation, if any.\n\n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof\n\n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n   1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\n   such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n   2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n   Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n   transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n   object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also\n   apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the\n   Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n   Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply\n   to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii)\n   Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed\n   hereunder.\n\n   3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n   to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n   intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\n   any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\n   infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n   needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\n   allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility\n   to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n   4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n   copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\n   set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3.

    &quot;__impliedText&quot;: &quot;Lucent Public License Version 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE\n(\&quot;AGREEMENT\&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES\nRECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\&quot;Contribution\&quot; means:\n\n   1. in the case of &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; (\&quot;&lt;OWNER&gt;\&quot;), the Original Program, and\n   2. in the case of each Contributor,\n         1. changes to the Program, and\n\n         2. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the\n         Program originate from and are \&quot;Contributed\&quot; by that particular\n         Contributor.\n     \n      A Contribution is \&quot;Contributed\&quot; by a Contributor only (i) if it was added\n      to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n      Contributor&#39;s behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in\n      accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or\n      additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the\n      Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n      conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)\n      are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\&quot;Contributor\&quot; means &lt;OWNER&gt; and any other entity that has Contributed a\nContribution to the Program.\n\n\&quot;Distributor\&quot; means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to\nthe Program, or any part thereof.\n\n\&quot;Licensed Patents\&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\&quot;Original Program\&quot; means the original version of the software accompanying this\nAgreement as released by &lt;OWNER&gt;, including source code, object code and\ndocumentation, if any.\n\n\&quot;Program\&quot; means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof\n\n\&quot;Recipient\&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n   1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\n   such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n   2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n   Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n   transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n   object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also\n   apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the\n   Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n   Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply\n   to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii)\n   Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed\n   hereunder.\n\n   3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n   to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n   intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\n   any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\n   infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n   needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\n   allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility\n   to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n   4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n   copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\n   set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this\nAgreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n   1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n\n   2. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a\n   copy of this Agreement or Distributor&#39;s own license agreement is included\n   with each copy of the Program; and\n\n   3. if distributed under Distributor&#39;s own license agreement, such license\n   agreement:\n   \n         1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions\n         of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of\n         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n         2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n         consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\n\n         3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\n\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the\nProgram:\n\n    Copyright (C) &lt;YEAR&gt;, &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; and others. All Rights Reserved. \n\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its\nadditions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once\nconsent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a\nDistributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nDistributor (\&quot;Commercial Distributor\&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery Contributor (\&quot;Indemnified Contributor\&quot;) against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively \&quot;Losses\&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nDistributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to\ncontrol, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\nany such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that\nCommercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\nCommercial Distributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors\nrelated to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\nrights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\nprogram errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\nOUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\na patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\nunder this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\naddition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\nsurvive.\n\n&lt;OWNER&gt; may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from\ntime to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed\nsubject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In\naddition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\nelect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\nversion. No one other than &lt;OWNER&gt; has the right to modify this Agreement.\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\nAgreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights\nin the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of &lt;STATE&gt; and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\nany resulting litigation.&quot;,
