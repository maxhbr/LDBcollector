<pre><code>Copyright Status for SAX

SAX is free!

In fact, it&#39;s not possible to own a license to SAX, since it&#39;s been placed in
the public domain.

No Warranty

Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty for the
design or for the software implementation, to the extent permitted by applicable
law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other
parties provide SAX &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind, either expressed or
implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any
copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute SAX, be
liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any
other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

Copyright Disclaimers

This page includes statements to that effect by David Megginson, who would have
been able to claim copyright for the original work.

SAX 1.0

Version 1.0 of the Simple API for XML (SAX), created collectively by the

applications, bundle it with your software distribution, include it on a CD-ROM,
list the source code in a book, mirror the documentation at your own web site,
or use it in any other way you see fit.

SAX 2.0

I hereby abandon any property rights to SAX 2.0 (the Simple API for XML), and
release all of the SAX 2.0 source code, compiled code, and documentation
