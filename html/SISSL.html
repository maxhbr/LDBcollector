   non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
   claims:
   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
       trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
       modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
       Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or

       effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original
       Code under the terms of this License.
   (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
       granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
       separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused
       by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
       combination of the Original Code with other software or devices,
       including but not limited to Modifications.

   3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

   3.1 Application of License.
   The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
   the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
   under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
   every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
   impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
   the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights
   hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is
   conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The
   Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set
   out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days
   before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
   Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish
   either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from
   implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of
   Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and
   to make any such deviation and reference implementation or
   Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as
   this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your
   first customer shipment of Your Modifications.

   3.2 Required Notices.
   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
   Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
   Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
   to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
   You may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
   Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
   for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership
   rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to
   charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
   obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code.
   However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
   the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
   alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any
   liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.
   You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if
   the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that
   Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
   Code version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this
   License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
   Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in
   which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Original Code.
   You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version
   of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which
   may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
   in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the
   Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make
   it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
   offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree
   to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the
   Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

   3.4 Larger Works.
   You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other
   code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.

   4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
   must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must
   be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set
   out in Section 3.1.

   6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

   6.1 New Versions.
   Sun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
   to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   6.2 Effect of New Versions.
   Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of
   the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms
   of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one
   other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to
   Original Code.

   7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
