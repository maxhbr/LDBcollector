Version 1.2 - January 4, 2001

Please read this License carefully before downloading this software. By downloading or using this
software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to
the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software.

1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Computer, Inc. (&quot;Apple&quot;)
makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as &quot;Original
Code&quot; and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 1.2 (or subsequent version
thereof) (&quot;License&quot;). As used in this License:

1.1 &quot;Applicable Patent Rights&quot; mean: (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are
now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original
Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b)
in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or
assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original
Code.

1.2 &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.

1.3 &quot;Covered Code&quot; means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications,
and/or any respective portions thereof.

1.4 &quot;Deploy&quot; means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for Your internal research and development
(R&amp;D) and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code
within Your business or organization except for R&amp;D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing
or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.

1.5 &quot;Larger Work&quot; means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the
terms of this License.

1.6 &quot;Modifications&quot; mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original
Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any
respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion
from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

1.7 &quot;Original Code&quot; means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under
this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple
under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the
object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License.

1.8 &quot;Personal Use&quot; means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for his or her personal, private and
non-commercial purposes. An individual&#39;s use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member,
independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not
qualify as Personal Use.

1.9 &quot;Source Code&quot; means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications
to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation
and installation of an executable (object code).

1.10 &quot;You&quot; or &quot;Your&quot; means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot;
or &quot;Your&quot; includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where &quot;control&quot;
means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such
entity.

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions &amp; Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby
grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple&#39;s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do
the following:

2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely
for Your internal research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance:

       (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary
       notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
       Original Code that refer to this License; and

       (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and
       documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that
       alter or restrict this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.

2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance:

       (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered
       Code;

       (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
       Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that You changed the files and the date of any change;

       (c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms
       of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the
       Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You
       should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g.
       download from a web site); and

       (d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
       notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered
       Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
       Source Code.

2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective
portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor
disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
the Covered Code.

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License:

       (a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your
       Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by
       You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same
       scope and extent as Apple&#39;s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

       (b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual
       and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other
       than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify or have modified
       (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through
       multiple tiers of distribution.

4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied,
are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple
which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and
not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient&#39;s agreement that any such Additional Terms are
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version
of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original
Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not
fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete
or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY,
UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE&#39;S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY
REFERRED TO AS &quot;APPLE&quot; FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET
ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR
DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE,
THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR
THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY
CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use
in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which
case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY
OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR
OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple&#39;s
total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the
amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apple
Computer&quot;, &quot;Mac OS X&quot;, &quot;Mac OS X Server&quot;, &quot;QuickTime&quot;, &quot;QuickTime Streaming Server&quot; or any other trademarks or
trade names belonging to Apple (collectively &quot;Apple Marks&quot;) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any
Contributor. No Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple&#39;s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in
and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code
and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (&quot;Apple Modifications&quot;), and such Apple Modifications will not be
automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under
this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

12. Termination.

12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

       (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and
       fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;

       (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or

       (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License,
       commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.

12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,
sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your
possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to
any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance
with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

13. Miscellaneous.

13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software
and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in
this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR
252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or
Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
those rights set forth herein.

13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any
other form of legal association between or amongYou, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the
contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple&#39;s right to acquire, license, develop, have others
develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise
compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be
deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.

13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion
thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to
effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and
effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically
complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it
that are in your possession or control.

13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall
take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and
venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California,
except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that
they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exig  que le pr sent
contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r dig s en anglais.

No party will be liable to\nany other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance\nwith its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n13.

(a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\nthereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to\neffect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and\neffect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically\ncomplying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will\nimmediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it\nthat are in your possession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution.

Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination\nof this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to\nany other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance\nwith its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n13.

(a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\nthereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to\neffect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and\neffect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically\ncomplying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will\nimmediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it\nthat are in your possession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution.

In each such instance, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.\n\n5. Limitations on Patent License.

No party will be liable to\nany other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance\nwith its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n13.

(a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\nthereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to\neffect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and\neffect.
