<h2>Comments on (easy) usability</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>↑</strong>“Note that a 2-clause form of the BSD license, removing the third condition, is also in use. This is because even a generous copyright license does not implicitly forfeit the copyright holder's "right of publicity". In other words, even if a license does not forbid you from claiming that the copyright holder or other parties endorses or promotes your work, the law generally does. We're not aware of any exceptions.” (source: <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses" title="Debian Free Software Guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> (NOASSERTION))</p></li>
