<li><p>“The QPL is not GPL-compatible, which, regardless of one's opinion about the license's DFSG-freeness, poses a major practical problem for any code licensed under the QPL that is reused elsewhere in conjunction with code under the GNU GPL. This makes the QPL alone a particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license. Trolltech's website describes how their dual-license approach is intended to be "open source-friendly" (see http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a dual-licensing policy?” (source: <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses" title="Debian Free Software Guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> (NOASSERTION))</p></li>

2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer of the Software, is distributed.

3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

    a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in the Software.

    b. When modifications to the Software are released under this license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of the initial developer.

4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software, provided that you meet these restrictions:

    a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

    b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent notices in the distribution explaining this.

    c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this license.

5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you or by others.

This makes the QPL alone a particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license. Trolltech&#39;s website describes how their dual-license approach is intended to be \&quot;open source-friendly\&quot; (see http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a dual-licensing policy?&quot;
