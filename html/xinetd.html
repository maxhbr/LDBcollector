Sensor Addition Version: 2.1.8.9pre14a Copyright 2001 by Steve Grubb

This is an exerpt from an email I recieved from the original author, allowing
xinetd as maintained by me, to use the higher version numbers:

I appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified in the
copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N &gt;= 3) version string for future xinetd
versions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that
would only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the
confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.</code></pre>

But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.\n\nSo, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N &gt;= 3) version string for future xinetd\nversions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that\nwould only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the\nconfusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.&quot;,
