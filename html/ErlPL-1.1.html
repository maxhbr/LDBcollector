    to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but
    solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary
    to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
    thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to
    Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of
this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with
every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights
hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 

3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source
Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.
    If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
    right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
    under this License), you must include a text file with the source
    code distribution titled ``LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and
    the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
    will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
    make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
    shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
    available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
    inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
    been obtained. 

(b) Contributor APIs.
    If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
    You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
    implement that API, you must also include this information in the
    LEGAL file. 

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You
created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own

Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\nCode, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where\nYou describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You\ncreated one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not\npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\nits structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such\nas a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version does\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source\nCode version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\nevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\nthe code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL\nfile described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6.
