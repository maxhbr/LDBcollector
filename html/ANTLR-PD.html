<h2>Description from open-license</h2>
<ul>
<li><pre><code>Description: We hope that somewhere in the documentation of commercial products, research projects, etc., it will be noted in the credits that ANTLR or ANTLR-generated code is being used. I would like to see the header description of the source code of the software in question remain intact.
Actions:
- Use the obtained source code without modification (Use the fetched code as it is.)
- Modify the obtained source code.
- Using Modified Source Code
- Use the retrieved object code (Use the fetched code as it is.)
- Use the retrieved binaries (Use the fetched binary as it is.)
- Use the object code generated from the modified source code
- Use binaries generated from modified source code
- Distribute the obtained source code without modification (Redistribute the code as it was obtained)
- Distribute the obtained object code (Redistribute the code as it was obtained)
- Distribute the fetched binaries (Redistribute the fetched binaries as they are)
- Distribution of Modified Source Code
- Distribute the object code generated from the modified source code
- Distribute the generated binaries from modified source code

<pre><code>ANTLR SOFTWARE RIGHTS

ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
Partially supported by University of San Francisco &amp; jGuru.com

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean that if you use ANTLR or
incorporate any source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.
