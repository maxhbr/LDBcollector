<pre><code>  CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Version 2.1 dated 2013-06-21


    Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
the two main principles guiding its drafting:

  * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
    of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
  * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
    is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
    property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
    holders of the economic rights over software.

The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre]) 
license are: 

Commissariat à l&#39;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives - CEA, a
public scientific, technical and industrial research establishment,
having its principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le
Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
and technological establishment, having its principal place of business
at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique -
Inria, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its
principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP
105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.


    Preamble

The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
license within the framework of an open source distribution model.

The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the software&#39;s author, the holder of the
economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
the user&#39;s attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the
CeCILL licenses family (http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html) for any 
necessary clarification.

and all measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual
property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors.


    Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES

7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.

However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
shall incur liability therefor.

7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
and the Licensee.


    Article 8 - LIABILITY

8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.

8.2 The Licensor&#39;s liability is limited to the commitments made under
this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
(i) loss due the Licensee&#39;s total or partial failure to fulfill its
obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
any or all compensation from the Licensor.


    Article 9 - WARRANTY

9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee&#39;s
attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
reserved for experienced users.

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
or properties.

9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
rights set forth in Article 5 &lt;#scope&gt;).

9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by
the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
that provided for in Article 9.2 &lt;#good-faith&gt; and, in particular,
without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
innovative or relevant nature.

Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
be compatible with the Licensee&#39;s own equipment and software
configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee&#39;s requirements.

9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
expertise for its defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be
decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee&#39;s use of the
name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
of a trademark.


    Article 10 - TERMINATION

10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
remained ineffective.

10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
with the terms and conditions hereof.


    Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS


      11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS

Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to
perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force
majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective
functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications
networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by
government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be
interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to
invoke said provision(s) subsequently.

11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
representatives.

11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.


      11.5 LANGUAGE

The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions
are deemed authentic.


    Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT

12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this
Agreement.

12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is
protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who
reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the
Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may
address new issues encountered by Free Software.

12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may
only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement
or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of Article 5.3.4
&lt;#compatibility&gt;.


    Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to
endeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes
that may arise during the performance of the Agreement.

13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their
occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the
disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having
jurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.

Cette garantie et les modalitÃÂ©s\nfinanciÃÂ¨res de son application feront l&#39;objet d&#39;un acte sÃÂ©parÃÂ© entre le\nConcÃÂ©dant et le LicenciÃÂ©.\n\n\n    Article 8 - RESPONSABILITE\n\n8.1 Sous rÃÂ©serve des dispositions de l&#39;article 8.2\n&lt;#limite-responsabilite&gt;, le LicenciÃÂ© a la facultÃÂ©, sous rÃÂ©serve de\nprouver la faute du ConcÃÂ©dant concernÃÂ©, de solliciter la rÃÂ©paration du\nprÃÂ©judice direct qu&#39;il subirait du fait du Logiciel et dont il apportera\nla preuve.\n\n8.2 La responsabilitÃÂ© du ConcÃÂ©dant est limitÃÂ©e aux engagements pris en\napplication du Contrat et ne saurait ÃÂªtre engagÃÂ©e en raison notamment:\n(i) des dommages dus ÃÂ  l&#39;inexÃÂ©cution, totale ou partielle, de ses\nobligations par le LicenciÃÂ©, (ii) des dommages directs ou indirects\ndÃÂ©coulant de l&#39;utilisation ou des performances du Logiciel subis par le\nLicenciÃÂ© et (iii) plus gÃÂ©nÃÂ©ralement d&#39;un quelconque dommage indirect. En\nparticulier, les Parties conviennent expressÃÂ©ment que tout prÃÂ©judice\nfinancier ou commercial (par exemple perte de donnÃÂ©es, perte de\nbÃÂ©nÃÂ©fices, perte d&#39;exploitation, perte de clientÃÂ¨le ou de commandes,\nmanque ÃÂ  gagner, trouble commercial quelconque) ou toute action dirigÃÂ©e\ncontre le LicenciÃÂ© par un tiers, constitue un dommage indirect et\nn&#39;ouvre pas droit ÃÂ  rÃÂ©paration par le ConcÃÂ©dant.\n\n\n    Article 9 - GARANTIE\n\n9.1 Le LicenciÃÂ© reconnaÃÂ®t que l&#39;ÃÂ©tat actuel des connaissances\nscientifiques et techniques au moment de la mise en circulation du\nLogiciel ne permet pas d&#39;en tester et d&#39;en vÃÂ©rifier toutes les\nutilisations ni de dÃÂ©tecter l&#39;existence d&#39;ÃÂ©ventuels dÃÂ©fauts. L&#39;attention\ndu LicenciÃÂ© a ÃÂ©tÃÂ© attirÃÂ©e sur ce point sur les risques associÃÂ©s au\nchargement, ÃÂ  l&#39;utilisation, la modification et/ou au dÃÂ©veloppement et ÃÂ \nla reproduction du Logiciel qui sont rÃÂ©servÃÂ©s ÃÂ  des utilisateurs avertis.\n\nIl relÃÂ¨ve de la responsabilitÃÂ© du LicenciÃÂ© de contrÃÂ´ler, par tous\nmoyens, l&#39;adÃÂ©quation du produit ÃÂ  ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et\nde s&#39;assurer qu&#39;il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux biens.\n\n9.2 Le ConcÃÂ©dant dÃÂ©clare de bonne foi ÃÂªtre en droit de concÃÂ©der\nl&#39;ensemble des droits attachÃÂ©s au Logiciel (comprenant notamment les\ndroits visÃÂ©s ÃÂ  l&#39;article 5 &lt;#etendue&gt;).\n\n9.3 Le LicenciÃÂ© reconnaÃÂ®t que le Logiciel est fourni \&quot;en l&#39;ÃÂ©tat\&quot; par le\nConcÃÂ©dant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prÃÂ©vue ÃÂ \nl&#39;article 9.2 &lt;#bonne-foi&gt; et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa\nvaleur commerciale, son caractÃÂ¨re sÃÂ©curisÃÂ©, innovant ou pertinent.\n\nEn particulier, le ConcÃÂ©dant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt\nd&#39;erreur, qu&#39;il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu&#39;il sera compatible\navec l&#39;ÃÂ©quipement du LicenciÃÂ© et sa configuration logicielle ni qu&#39;il\nremplira les besoins du LicenciÃÂ©.\n\n9.4 Le ConcÃÂ©dant ne garantit pas, de maniÃÂ¨re expresse ou tacite, que le\nLogiciel ne porte pas atteinte ÃÂ  un quelconque droit de propriÃÂ©tÃÂ©\nintellectuelle d&#39;un tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout\nautre droit de propriÃÂ©tÃÂ©. Ainsi, le ConcÃÂ©dant exclut toute garantie au\nprofit du LicenciÃÂ© contre les actions en contrefaÃÂ§on qui pourraient ÃÂªtre\ndiligentÃÂ©es au titre de l&#39;utilisation, de la modification, et de la\nredistribution du Logiciel. NÃÂ©anmoins, si de telles actions sont\nexercÃÂ©es contre le LicenciÃÂ©, le ConcÃÂ©dant lui apportera son expertise\ntechnique et juridique pour sa dÃÂ©fense. Cette expertise technique et\njuridique est dÃÂ©terminÃÂ©e au cas par cas entre le ConcÃÂ©dant concernÃÂ© et\nle LicenciÃÂ© dans le cadre d&#39;un protocole d&#39;accord. Le ConcÃÂ©dant dÃÂ©gage\ntoute responsabilitÃÂ© quant ÃÂ  l&#39;utilisation de la dÃÂ©nomination du\nLogiciel par le LicenciÃÂ©. Aucune garantie n&#39;est apportÃÂ©e quant ÃÂ \nl&#39;existence de droits antÃÂ©rieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur\nl&#39;existence d&#39;une marque.\n\n\n    Article 10 - RESILIATION\n\n10.1 En cas de manquement par le LicenciÃÂ© aux obligations mises ÃÂ  sa\ncharge par le Contrat, le ConcÃÂ©dant pourra rÃÂ©silier de plein droit le\nContrat trente (30) jours aprÃÂ¨s notification adressÃÂ©e au LicenciÃÂ© et\nrestÃÂ©e sans effet.\n\n10.2 Le LicenciÃÂ© dont le Contrat est rÃÂ©siliÃÂ© n&#39;est plus autorisÃÂ© ÃÂ \nutiliser, modifier ou distribuer le Logiciel. Cependant, toutes les\nlicences qu&#39;il aura concÃÂ©dÃÂ©es antÃÂ©rieurement ÃÂ  la rÃÂ©siliation du Contrat\nresteront valides sous rÃÂ©serve qu&#39;elles aient ÃÂ©tÃÂ© effectuÃÂ©es en\nconformitÃÂ© avec le Contrat.\n\n\n    Article 11 - DISPOSITIONS DIVERSES\n\n\n      11.1 CAUSE EXTERIEURE\n\nAucune des Parties ne sera responsable d&#39;un retard ou d&#39;une dÃÂ©faillance\nd&#39;exÃÂ©cution du Contrat qui serait dÃÂ» ÃÂ  un cas de force majeure, un cas\nfortuit ou une cause extÃÂ©rieure, telle que, notamment, le mauvais\nfonctionnement ou les interruptions du rÃÂ©seau ÃÂ©lectrique ou de\ntÃÂ©lÃÂ©communication, la paralysie du rÃÂ©seau liÃÂ©e ÃÂ  une attaque\ninformatique, l&#39;intervention des autoritÃÂ©s gouvernementales, les\ncatastrophes naturelles, les dÃÂ©gÃÂ¢ts des eaux, les tremblements de terre,\nle feu, les explosions, les grÃÂ¨ves et les conflits sociaux, l&#39;ÃÂ©tat de\nguerre...\n\n11.2 Le fait, par l&#39;une ou l&#39;autre des Parties, d&#39;omettre en une ou\nplusieurs occasions de se prÃÂ©valoir d&#39;une ou plusieurs dispositions du\nContrat, ne pourra en aucun cas impliquer renonciation par la Partie\nintÃÂ©ressÃÂ©e ÃÂ  s&#39;en prÃÂ©valoir ultÃÂ©rieurement.\n\n11.3 Le Contrat annule et remplace toute convention antÃÂ©rieure, ÃÂ©crite\nou orale, entre les Parties sur le mÃÂªme objet et constitue l&#39;accord\nentier entre les Parties sur cet objet. Aucune addition ou modification\naux termes du Contrat n&#39;aura d&#39;effet ÃÂ  l&#39;ÃÂ©gard des Parties ÃÂ  moins\nd&#39;ÃÂªtre faite par ÃÂ©crit et signÃÂ©e par leurs reprÃÂ©sentants dÃÂ»ment habilitÃÂ©s.\n\n11.4 Dans l&#39;hypothÃÂ¨se oÃÂ¹ une ou plusieurs des dispositions du Contrat\ns&#39;avÃÂ¨rerait contraire ÃÂ  une loi ou ÃÂ  un texte applicable, existants ou\nfuturs, cette loi ou ce texte prÃÂ©vaudrait, et les Parties feraient les\namendements nÃÂ©cessaires pour se conformer ÃÂ  cette loi ou ÃÂ  ce texte.\nToutes les autres dispositions resteront en vigueur.
