        claims:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify,

        sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions
        thereof).

        (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
        on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under
        the terms of this License.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
        granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
        separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused

            basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a
            Larger Work; and

            b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
            Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
            combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
            otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or

            (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
            on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered
            Code.

            granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
            Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for
            infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor
            Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that

            Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by
            Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
            Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Application of License.

        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
        of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
        copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
        distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
        version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
        License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include
        an additional document offering the additional rights described in
        Section 3.5.

        3.2. Availability of Source Code.

        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
        made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
        either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
        Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
        months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
        (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
        has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
        ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

        3.3. Description of Modifications.

        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
        file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
        the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
        the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
        Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
        Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
        origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

            (a) Third Party Claims.

            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s
            intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
            granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
            must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
            &quot;../LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
            sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
            Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
            available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
            modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
            thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
            mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
            received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs.

            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming
            interface (&quot;API&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
            which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
            also include this information in the LEGAL file.

            (c) Representations.

            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
            3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications
            are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
            sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
            License

            .

        3.5. Required Notices.

        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
        Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
        Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
        to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
        Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
        for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership
        rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
        any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
        offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
        support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
        and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
        the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
        in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
        collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the
        Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
        Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
        compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s
        rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
        License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
        from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
        the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
        terms You offer.

        3.7. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
        code
        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
        Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

        6.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. (&quot;Sun&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.

        6.2. Effect of New Versions.

        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
        the
        License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
        version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
        of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one
        other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
        Code created under this License.

        6.3. Derivative Works.

        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
        may
        only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
        governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that
        the phrases &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Sun Public License,&quot; or &quot;SPL&quot;../ or any confusingly
        similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your
        license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
        that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
        Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
        License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;../AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

        8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
        sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
        survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
        shall survive.

        8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
        claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
        or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
        You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging
        that:

            (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
            infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
            Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
            shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
            unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
            agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
            royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
            Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
            the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days
            of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
            mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
            is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
            the 60 day notice period specified above.

            (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s
            Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
            any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
            and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
            sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
            Participant.

        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
        alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
        license.

        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
        all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in
    48
    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot;
    and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot;../ as such terms are
    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights
    set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and
    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
    License.

    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
    ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial
    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
    Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the

You are responsible for\n        ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n        3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n        file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n        the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n        the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n        Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n        Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n        origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n            (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s\n            intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n            granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\n            must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\n            \&quot;../LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n            sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\n            Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n            available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\n            modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n            thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\n            mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\n            received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n            (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming\n            interface (\&quot;API\&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses\n            which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n            also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n            (c) Representations.\n\n            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\n            3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications\n            are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has\n            sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\n            License\n\n            .\n\n        3.5. Required Notices.\n\n        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n        Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n        Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n        to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\n        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n        Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n        for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership\n        rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\n        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n        any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n        offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n        support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n        and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n        the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n        in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n        collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the\n        Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n        Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n        compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s\n        rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n        License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n        from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n        the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n        terms You offer.\n\n        3.7. Larger Works.\n\n        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n        code\n        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n        Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n    5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n    6. Versions of the License.\n\n        6.1. New Versions.\n\n        Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\&quot;Sun\&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions\n        of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a\n        distinguishing version number.\n\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n        the\n        License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n        version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n        of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one\n        other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n        Code created under this License.\n\n        6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n        may\n        only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n        governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that\n        the phrases \&quot;Sun,\&quot; \&quot;Sun Public License,\&quot; or \&quot;SPL\&quot;../ or any confusingly\n        similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your\n        license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear\n        that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n        Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\n        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n        License.)\n\n    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;../AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n    DISCLAIMER.\n\n    8. TERMINATION.\n\n        8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n        sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n        survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n        shall survive.\n\n        8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n        claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n        or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n        You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging\n        that:\n\n            (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n            infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n            Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n            shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n            unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n            agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n            royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n            Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n            the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\n            of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n            mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n            is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n            the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n            (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s\n            Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n            any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n            and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n            sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n            Participant.\n\n        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n        alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or\n        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n        license.\n\n        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n        all\n        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n        prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in\n    48\n    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot;\n    and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot;../ as such terms are\n    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.\n    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights\n    set forth herein.\n\n    11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and\n    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n    License.\n\n    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n    Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the\n    Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\n    Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.\n\n        The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License\n\n        Version 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in\n\n        compliance with the License.

Contributor Grant.\n\n        Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n        hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent\n            or\n            trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n            display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created\n            by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified\n            basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a\n            Larger Work; and\n\n            b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of\n            Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in\n            combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n            otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\n            portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by\n            that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n            combination).\n\n            (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n            on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered\n            Code.\n\n            (d) notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n            granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n            Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for\n            infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor\n            Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that\n            Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor\n            Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by\n            Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that\n            Contributor.\n\n    3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n        3.1. Application of License.\n\n        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n        of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n        copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n        distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n        version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n        License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include\n        an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n        Section 3.5.\n\n        3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n        made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n        either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n        Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n        Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n        months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n        (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n        has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n        ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n        3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n        file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n        the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n        the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n        Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n        Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n        origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n            (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s\n            intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n            granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\n            must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\n            \&quot;../LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n            sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\n            Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n            available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\n            modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n            thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\n            mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\n            received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n            (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming\n            interface (\&quot;API\&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses\n            which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n            also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n            (c) Representations.\n\n            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\n            3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications\n            are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has\n            sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\n            License\n\n            .\n\n        3.5. Required Notices.\n\n        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n        Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n        Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n        to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\n        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n        Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n        for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership\n        rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\n        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n        any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n        offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n        support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n        and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n        the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n        in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n        collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the\n        Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n        Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n        compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s\n        rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n        License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n        from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n        the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n        terms You offer.\n\n        3.7. Larger Works.\n\n        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n        code\n        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n        Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n    5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n    6. Versions of the License.\n\n        6.1. New Versions.\n\n        Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\&quot;Sun\&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions\n        of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a\n        distinguishing version number.\n\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n        the\n        License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n        version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n        of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one\n        other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n        Code created under this License.\n\n        6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n        may\n        only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n        governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that\n        the phrases \&quot;Sun,\&quot; \&quot;Sun Public License,\&quot; or \&quot;SPL\&quot;../ or any confusingly\n        similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your\n        license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear\n        that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n        Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\n        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n        License.)\n\n    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;../AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n    DISCLAIMER.\n\n    8. TERMINATION.\n\n        8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n        sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n        survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n        shall survive.\n\n        8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n        claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n        or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n        You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging\n        that:\n\n            (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n            infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n            Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n            shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n            unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n            agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n            royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n            Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n            the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\n            of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n            mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n            is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n            the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n            (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s\n            Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n            any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n            and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n            sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n            Participant.\n\n        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n        alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or\n        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n        license.\n\n        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n        all\n        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n        prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in\n    48\n    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot;\n    and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot;../ as such terms are\n    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.\n    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights\n    set forth herein.\n\n    11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and\n    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n    License.\n\n    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n    Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the\n    Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\n    Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.\n\n        The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License\n\n        Version 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in\n\n        compliance with the License.

You may choose to offer, and to \r\n\tcharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability \r\n\tobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You \r\n\tmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial \r\n\tDeveloper or any Contributor.

The notice must be conspicuously included \r\n\tin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \r\n\tcollateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the \r\n\tCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \r\n\tCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may \r\n\tcontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in \r\n\tcompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the \r\n\tExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s \r\n\trights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \r\n\tLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different \r\n\tlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ \r\n\tfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial \r\n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the \r\n\tInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \r\n\tthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such \r\n\tterms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.7.

Except to the \r\n\textent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be \r\n\tsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to \r\n\tunderstand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License. \r\n\r\n\tThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has \r\n\tattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6.

In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all \r\n\tend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) \r\n\twhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder \r\n\tprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9.

If You created one or more Modification(s) \r\n\tYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \r\n\tExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \r\n\tfor the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership \r\n\trights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to \r\n\tcharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability \r\n\tobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You \r\n\tmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial \r\n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than \r\n\tany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is \r\n\toffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial \r\n\tDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \r\n\tInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, \r\n\tsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n\tYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the \r\n\trequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, \r\n\tand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of \r\n\tthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, \r\n\tincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \r\n\tobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included \r\n\tin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \r\n\tcollateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the \r\n\tCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \r\n\tCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may \r\n\tcontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in \r\n\tcompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the \r\n\tExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s \r\n\trights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \r\n\tLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different \r\n\tlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ \r\n\tfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial \r\n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the \r\n\tInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \r\n\tthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such \r\n\tterms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n\tYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code \r\n\tnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger \r\n\tWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \r\n\trequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \r\n\r\n\tIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \r\n\tLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to \r\n\tstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with \r\n\tthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) \r\n\tdescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description \r\n\tmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must \r\n\tbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the \r\n\textent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be \r\n\tsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to \r\n\tunderstand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License. \r\n\r\n\tThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has \r\n\tattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6.

In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all \r\n\tend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) \r\n\twhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder \r\n\tprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9.

Contributor Grant.\n\n        Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n        hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent\n            or\n            trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n            display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created\n            by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified\n            basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a\n            Larger Work; and\n\n            b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of\n            Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in\n            combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n            otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\n            portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by\n            that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n            combination).\n\n            (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n            on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered\n            Code.\n\n            (d) notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n            granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n            Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for\n            infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor\n            Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that\n            Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor\n            Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by\n            Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that\n            Contributor.\n\n    3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n        3.1. Application of License.\n\n        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n        of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n        copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n        distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n        version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n        License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include\n        an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n        Section 3.5.\n\n        3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n        made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n        either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n        Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n        Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n        months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n        (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n        has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n        ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n        3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n        file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n        the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n        the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n        Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n        Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n        origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n            (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s\n            intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n            granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\n            must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\n            \&quot;../LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n            sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\n            Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\n            available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\n            modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n            thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\n            mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\n            received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n            (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming\n            interface (\&quot;API\&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses\n            which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n            also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n            (c) Representations.\n\n            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\n            3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications\n            are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has\n            sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\n            License\n\n            .\n\n        3.5. Required Notices.\n\n        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n        Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n        Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n        to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\n        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n        Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n        for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership\n        rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\n        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n        any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n        offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n        support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n        and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n        the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n        in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n        collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the\n        Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n        Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n        compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s\n        rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n        License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n        from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n        the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n        terms You offer.\n\n        3.7. Larger Works.\n\n        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n        code\n        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n        Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n    5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n    6. Versions of the License.\n\n        6.1. New Versions.\n\n        Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\&quot;Sun\&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions\n        of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a\n        distinguishing version number.\n\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n        the\n        License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n        version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n        of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one\n        other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n        Code created under this License.\n\n        6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n        may\n        only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n        governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that\n        the phrases \&quot;Sun,\&quot; \&quot;Sun Public License,\&quot; or \&quot;SPL\&quot;../ or any confusingly\n        similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your\n        license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear\n        that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n        Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\n        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n        License.)\n\n    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \&quot;../AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n    DISCLAIMER.\n\n    8. TERMINATION.\n\n        8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n        sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n        survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n        shall survive.\n\n        8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n        claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n        or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n        You file such action is referred to as \&quot;Participant\&quot;) alleging\n        that:\n\n            (a) such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n            infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n            Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n            shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n            unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n            agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n            royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n            Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n            the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\n            of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n            mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n            is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n            the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n            (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s\n            Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n            any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n            and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n            sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n            Participant.\n\n        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n        alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or\n        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n        license.\n\n        8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n        all\n        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n        prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a \&quot;commercial item,\&quot; as that term is defined in\n    48\n    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \&quot;commercial computer software\&quot;\n    and \&quot;commercial computer software documentation,\&quot;../ as such terms are\n    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.\n    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights\n    set forth herein.\n\n    11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and\n    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n    License.\n\n    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n    Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the\n    Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\n    Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.\n\n        The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License\n\n        Version 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in\n\n        compliance with the License.
