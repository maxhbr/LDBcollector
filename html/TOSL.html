<h2>General Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>“Per Fedora, the Trusster Open Source License (TOSL) is a derivation of the Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where the Sleepycat License says The source code must either be included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific The source code must either be included in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license, TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the "no more restrictive" language. ” (source: <a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/src/licensedcode/data/licenses/tosl.yml" title="Scancode">Scancode</a> (CC0-1.0))</p></li>
