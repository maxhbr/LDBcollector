<li><p>“Per Fedora, this is an Apache 1.1 derived license. Unfortunately, clause 4 is too broad, making it Free but GPL-incompatible. It does also replace the deprecated keys classworlds and apache-due-credit that were the same licenses. Plexus Classworlds was started in 2002 and dom4j in 2000/2001 hence it has precedence. Other projects such as Exolab/Intalio/Castor and JCharts have used the same license. Castor is actually the first to use this but dom4j is still commonly used and castor less so. ” (source: <a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/src/licensedcode/data/licenses/dom4j.yml" title="Scancode">Scancode</a> (CC0-1.0))</p></li>
