Terms &amp; Conditions Of Use
May, 2002
Copyright (C) 2002. OCLC Research. All Rights Reserved
 
PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE CODE BASE 
AND/OR DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE (THE &quot;License&quot;), YOU AGREE TO 
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. 

Section 1.	Your Rights

	Subject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of Research (the 
&quot;Original Contributor&quot;) and each subsequent contributor (collectively with the Original Contributor, the 
&quot;Contributors&quot;) hereby grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute, 
prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial 
purposes, the original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called 
the &quot;Program&quot;).

Section 2.	Definitions 

A &quot;Modification&quot; to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents of any file of 
the Program and any new file that contains any part of the Program. If you make a Modification and 
distribute the Program externally you are a &quot;Contributor.&quot; The distribution of the Program must be under 
the terms of this license including those in Section 3 below. 

A &quot;Combined Work&quot; results from combining and integrating all or parts of the Program with 
other code. A Combined Work may be thought of as having multiple parents or being result of multiple 
lines of code development. 

Section 3.	Distribution Licensing Terms 

A.	General Requirements

Except as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction (see 
below), a distribution of the Program in any of the forms listed below must not put any 
further restrictions on the recipient&#39;s exercise of the rights granted herein.

As a Contributor, you represent that your Modification(s) are your original creation(s) 
and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not 
limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modification(s). You represent 
that each of your Modifications includes complete details of any third-party right or 
other third-party restriction associated with any part of your Modification (including a 
copy of any applicable license agreement).

The Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically 
transferring the files to the recipient.

This Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be prominently displayed with 
every distribution of the Program in any form:

YOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED).  ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES 
NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR 
GUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO:  
(A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY 
MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE 
RESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING THE PROGRAM, ANY 
MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK.   IN NO EVENT 
SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE 
GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE 
PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU 
HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AGAINST 
CONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM.

B.	Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code 

If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications 
(e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient. In addition, each 
source and data file of the Program and any Modification you distribute must contain 
the following notice: 

&quot;Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, 
Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.  The contents of this file, as updated 
from time to time by the OCLC Office of Research, are subject to OCLC Research 
Public License Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in 
compliance with the License. You may obtain a current copy of the License at 
http://purl.oclc.org/oclc/research/ORPL/.  Software distributed under the License is 
distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express 
or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations 
under the License.  This software consists of voluntary contributions made by many 
individuals on behalf of OCLC Research. For more information on OCLC Research, 
please see http://www.oclc.org/oclc/research/.  The Original Code is 
 .  The Initial Developer of the Original Code is 
 . Portions created by   are 
Copyright (C)    . All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s): 
 .&quot;

C.	Requirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code 

If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make Modifications 
(e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient and you must 
include the following statement in appropriate and conspicuous locations:

&quot;Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, 
Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.&quot;

In addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution or the 
distributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request.

D.	Requirements for a Combined Work Distribution

Distributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be 
made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files 
to recipient.

A Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable code. The 
requirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions.

An &quot;Aggregate Work&quot; is when the Program exists, without integration, with other 
programs on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an 
Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of &quot;Program&quot; provided in this 
License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program 
contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License.  Also, should the Program 
be extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program 
apart from the Aggregate Work.

Section 4.	License Grant

For purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees 
hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-
free, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, 
enhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works 
based on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 
4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.

Section 5.	Termination of Rights

This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) 
automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with 
respect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.

If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this 
License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming 
aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are 
properly granted shall survive such termination.

Section 6.	Other Terms

Except for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of 
the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.  You agree not to remove, 
alter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. 

All transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. 
import/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other 
similar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.

Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a 
provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any 
third party.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property 
infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of 
this License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot 
distribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other 
conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
you could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already 
distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to 
inform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable 
step to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. 

The provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of 
any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.  In 
substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the 
original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.

The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended 
license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License 
grants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the 
intellectual property of any Contributor.

		This License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the 
parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of 
the parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of 
Ohio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.</code></pre>

All rights reserved.\&quot;\n\nIn addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution or the \ndistributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request.\n\nD.\tRequirements for a Combined Work Distribution\n\nDistributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be \nmade at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files \nto recipient.\n\nA Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable code. The \nrequirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions.\n\nAn \&quot;Aggregate Work\&quot; is when the Program exists, without integration, with other \nprograms on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an \nAggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of \&quot;Program\&quot; provided in this \nLicense. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program \ncontained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License.  Also, should the Program \nbe extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program \napart from the Aggregate Work.\n\nSection 4.\tLicense Grant\n\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees \nhereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-\nfree, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, \nenhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works \nbased on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section \n4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.\n\nSection 5.\tTermination of Rights\n\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) \nautomatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with \nrespect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this \nLicense shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming \naware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are \nproperly granted shall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6.\tOther Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of \nthe Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.  You agree not to remove, \nalter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. \n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. \nimport/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other \nsimilar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a \nprovision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any \nthird party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property \ninfringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of \nthis License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot \ndistribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other \nconditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, \nyou could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain \nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already \ndistributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to \ninform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable \nstep to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. \n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of \nany provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.  In \nsubstitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the \noriginal intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended \nlicense will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License \ngrants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the \nintellectual property of any Contributor.\n\n\t\tThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the \nparties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of \nthe parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \nOhio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.&quot;,

You represent \nthat each of your Modifications includes complete details of any third-party right or \nother third-party restriction associated with any part of your Modification (including a \ncopy of any applicable license agreement).\n\nThe Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically \ntransferring the files to the recipient.\n\nThis Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be prominently displayed with \nevery distribution of the Program in any form:\n\nYOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY \nOF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED).  ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES \nNO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS \nOR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR \nGUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES \nOF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO:  \n(A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY \nMODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE \nRESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING THE PROGRAM, ANY \nMODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK.   IN NO EVENT \nSHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, \nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER \nDAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE \nGOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS \nINTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, \nWHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING \nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE \nPROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU \nHEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AGAINST \nCONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM.\n\nB.\tRequirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code \n\nIf you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications \n(e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient. In addition, each \nsource and data file of the Program and any Modification you distribute must contain \nthe following notice: \n\n\&quot;Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, \nInc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.

See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations \nunder the License.  This software consists of voluntary contributions made by many \nindividuals on behalf of OCLC Research. For more information on OCLC Research, \nplease see http://www.oclc.org/oclc/research/.  The Original Code is \n .  The Initial Developer of the Original Code is \n . Portions created by   are \nCopyright (C)    . All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s): \n .\&quot;\n\nC.\tRequirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code \n\nIf you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make Modifications \n(e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient and you must \ninclude the following statement in appropriate and conspicuous locations:\n\n\&quot;Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, \nInc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.\&quot;\n\nIn addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution or the \ndistributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request.\n\nD.\tRequirements for a Combined Work Distribution\n\nDistributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be \nmade at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files \nto recipient.\n\nA Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable code. The \nrequirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions.\n\nAn \&quot;Aggregate Work\&quot; is when the Program exists, without integration, with other \nprograms on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an \nAggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of \&quot;Program\&quot; provided in this \nLicense. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program \ncontained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License.  Also, should the Program \nbe extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program \napart from the Aggregate Work.\n\nSection 4.\tLicense Grant\n\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees \nhereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-\nfree, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, \nenhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works \nbased on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section \n4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.\n\nSection 5.\tTermination of Rights\n\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) \nautomatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with \nrespect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this \nLicense shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming \naware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are \nproperly granted shall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6.\tOther Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of \nthe Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor.  You agree not to remove, \nalter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. \n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. \nimport/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other \nsimilar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a \nprovision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any \nthird party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property \ninfringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of \nthis License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot \ndistribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other \nconditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, \nyou could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain \nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already \ndistributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to \ninform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable \nstep to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. \n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of \nany provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.  In \nsubstitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the \noriginal intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended \nlicense will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License \ngrants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the \nintellectual property of any Contributor.\n\n\t\tThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the \nparties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of \nthe parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \nOhio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.&quot;,
