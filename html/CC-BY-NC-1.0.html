CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DRAFT LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

&quot;Collective Work&quot; means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
&quot;Derivative Work&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
&quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
&quot;Original Author&quot; means the individual or entity who created the Work.
&quot;Work&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
&quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor&#39;s knowledge after reasonable inquiry:
Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark &quot;Creative Commons&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\nto reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\nto create and reproduce Derivative Works;\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\nYou may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nBy offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor&#39;s knowledge after reasonable inquiry:\nLicensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\nThe Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.\n6.

Termination\n\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n8. Miscellaneous\n\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. \n\n1. Definitions\n\n    a. \&quot;Collective Work\&quot; means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which \n       the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting \n       separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that \n       constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) \n       for the purposes of this License.\n    b. \&quot;Derivative Work\&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, \n       such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, \n       sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be \n       recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not \n       be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n    c. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n    d. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n    e. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n    f. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously \n       violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission \n       from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce \n       the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly \n       by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly \n       by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work \n       only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource \n       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly \n       display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms \n       on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights \n       granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to \n       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly \n       perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access \n       or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies \n       to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work \n       apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective \n       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective \n       Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative \n       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative \n       Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n    b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that \n       is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. \n       The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise \n       shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary \n       compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange \n       of copyrighted works.\n    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work \n       or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work \n       and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying \n       the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work \n       if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work \n       in the Derivative Work (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay \n       based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; \n       provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit \n       will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent \n       as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n    a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, \n       to the best of Licensor&#39;s knowledge after reasonable inquiry:\n         i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder \n            and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having \n            any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\n        ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights \n            or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy \n            or other tortious injury to any third party.\n    b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE \n       LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS \n       OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF \n       THE WORK.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You \n       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective \n       Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided \n       such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, \n       and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration \n       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right \n       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; \n       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license \n       that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will \n       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor \n       offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted \n       to You under this License.\n    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to \n       the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted \n       to You under this License.\n    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect \n       the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further \n       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent \n       necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \n       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver \n       or consent.\n    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed \n       here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified \n       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication \n       from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor \n       and You.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.&quot;,

A collective work is an unmodified assembly of independent works, such as periodicals, poetry collections and encyclopedias. The works comprising a collective work shall not be considered derivative works under this license. A work that constitutes a collective work shall not be considered a derivative work under this license. The original author is the person or entity that created the work. A person or entity exercising rights under this License who has never previously violated the terms of this License with respect to his or her work, or who has expressly granted Licensor permission to exercise his or her rights in the past, even if he or she has previously violated the License.\nActions:\n- Reproduce the work.\n- Creating a derivative work\n- Incorporate a work into one or more collective works\n- Reproduce a work incorporated into a collective work\n- Reproduce a derivative work\n- Distribute copies of the work (including works incorporated into a collective work)\n- Distributing a medium on which a recording of a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work) is made\n- Public display of a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work)\n- Publicly perform a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work)\n- Public performance of a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work) by digital audio transmission\n\nConditions:\nAND\n  RESTRICTION: Exercise rights in all current and future media and formats\n  RESTRICTION: Make technical changes for use in other media or formats, if necessary\n  OBLIGATION: Include a copy of this license or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) identifying this license\n  RESTRICTION: Does not present or impose conditions that alter or limit the rights of the recipient to exercise under this license\n  RESTRICTION: No sublicensing of copyrighted material.

Fair Use Rights.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work \n       only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource \n       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly \n       display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms \n       on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights \n       granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to \n       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly \n       perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access \n       or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies \n       to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work \n       apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective \n       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective \n       Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative \n       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative \n       Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n    b.

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work \n       or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work \n       and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying \n       the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work \n       if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work \n       in the Derivative Work (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay \n       based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; \n       provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit \n       will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent \n       as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n    a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, \n       to the best of Licensor&#39;s knowledge after reasonable inquiry:\n         i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder \n            and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having \n            any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\n        ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights \n            or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy \n            or other tortious injury to any third party.\n    b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE \n       LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS \n       OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF \n       THE WORK.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You \n       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective \n       Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided \n       such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, \n       and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration \n       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right \n       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; \n       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license \n       that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will \n       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor \n       offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted \n       to You under this License.\n    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to \n       the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted \n       to You under this License.\n    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect \n       the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further \n       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent \n       necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \n       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver \n       or consent.\n    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed \n       here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified \n       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication \n       from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor \n       and You.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.&quot;,

A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\&quot;Derivative Work\&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n\&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n\&quot;Original Author\&quot; means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n\&quot;Work\&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n\&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n2.

Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\nto reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\nto create and reproduce Derivative Works;\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\nYou may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\nIf you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \&quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\&quot; or \&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nBy offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor&#39;s knowledge after reasonable inquiry:\nLicensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\nThe Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \&quot;AS IS\&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.\n6.

Termination\n\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n8. Miscellaneous\n\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.&quot;,
