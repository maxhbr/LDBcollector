On on July 22 1999, per notice reproduced below, the advertising clause (clause
3) of this license was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of
Technology Licensing of the University of California.

This applies only to BSD Unix files copyrighted by the Regents of the University
of California under this license.

From: ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change :

&quot;July 22, 1999

To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution (&quot;BSD&quot;) source
code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
contributors.

Specifically, the provision reads:

&quot;     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
      *    must display the following acknowledgement:
      *    This product includes software developed by the University of
      *    California, Berkeley and its contributors.&quot;

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
in its entirety.

William Hoskins
Director, Office of Technology Licensing
University of California, Berkeley&quot;

Note also that in many variants of this original BSD license, both occurrences
of the phrase &quot;REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS&quot; is replaced in the disclaimer section
by &quot;COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS&quot;.</code></pre>
