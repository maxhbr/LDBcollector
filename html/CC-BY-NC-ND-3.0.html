       Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in 
       timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose 
       of this License.

       anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other 
       than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of 
       their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety 
       in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and 
       independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
       constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes 
       of this License.

       producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other

       considered a literary or artistic work.

    g. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously 
       violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express 
       permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    h. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the 
       public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the 
       Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

    b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.

    c. For the avoidance of doubt:
          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to 
             collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the 
             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of 
             the rights granted under this License;

         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
             royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor 
             waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights 
             granted under this License; and,

        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether 
             individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that 
             administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the 
             rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must 
       include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of 
       the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work 
       that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise 
       the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the 
       Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of 
       warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or 
       Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work 
       that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to 
       that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as 
       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself 
       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any 
       Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by 
       Section 4(b), as requested.

    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has 
       been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or 
       pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate 
       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution 
       (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable 
       means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the 
       extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the 
       Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the 
       Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; 
       provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a 
       credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and 
       in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the 
       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of 
       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may 
       not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by 
       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of 
       the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor 
       and/or Attribution Parties.

    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by 
       applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as 
       part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in 
       relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You 
       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under 
       this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or 
       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive 
       any termination of this License.

    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration 
       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right 
       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other 
       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this 
       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the 
       recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You 
       under this License.

    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not 
       affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without 
       further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
       extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such 
       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or 
       consent.

    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work 
       licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work 
       not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in 
       any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement 
       of the Licensor and You.

    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted 
       utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic 
       Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty 
       of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright 
       Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the 
       relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the 
       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable 
       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes 
       additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included 
       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under 
       applicable law.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the \n       Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,\n\n    b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\n\n    c. For the avoidance of doubt:\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to \n             collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the \n             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of \n             the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect \n             royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor \n             waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights \n             granted under this License; and,\n\n        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether \n             individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that \n             administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the \n             rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must \n       include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of \n       the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work \n       that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise \n       the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the \n       Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of \n       warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or \n       Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work \n       that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to \n       that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as \n       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself \n       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any \n       Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by \n       Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has \n       been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, \n       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or \n       pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate \n       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution \n       (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable \n       means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the \n       extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the \n       Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the \n       Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; \n       provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a \n       credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and \n       in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the \n       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of \n       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may \n       not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by \n       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of \n       the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor \n       and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by \n       applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as \n       part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in \n       relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You \n       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under \n       this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or \n       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive \n       any termination of this License.\n\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration \n       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right \n       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; \n       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other \n       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this \n       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the \n       recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You \n       under this License.\n\n    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not \n       affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without \n       further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \n       extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \n       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or \n       consent.\n\n    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work \n       licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work \n       not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in \n       any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement \n       of the Licensor and You.\n\n    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted \n       utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic \n       Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty \n       of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright \n       Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the \n       relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the \n       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable \n       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes \n       additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included \n       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under \n       applicable law.\n\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

                    &quot;_str&quot;: &quot;Description: A work is a literary or artistic work offered under this licence in any form, including digital forms of expression, including, but not limited to, creations in the fields of literature, science and the arts. Works of authorship are works of creation in the fields of literature, science and the arts, including, but not limited to, books, pamphlets, other written works, and other works of authorship in digital form. This license includes, but is not limited to: books, pamphlets, and other written works; lectures, speeches, and sermons of the same nature as lectures, speeches, and sermons; plays, musical productions, choreography, and silent plays; musical works with or without lyrics; cinematographic and similarly expressed works in motion pictures; sketches, paintings, architecture, sculptures, and prints. The work of photography, lithography, photographic works, works of applied art, illustrations, maps, blueprints, sketches, or other three-dimensional works related to geography, topography, architecture, or science, demonstrations, broadcasts, sound recordings, and the compilation of copyrighted data. A work performed by a variety or circus performer, to the extent that it is not considered an object, a literary work, or a work of art, including, but not limited to, the recording of sound and visual information, rights to fixation, and copies of works. Reproduction means the reproduction of a work by means of any means, including, but not limited to, the right to record or fix audio or visual information, or copies of a work, including, but not limited to, protected performance or sound recording storage devices in digital form or other electronic media. A collective work is a collection of works, such as encyclopedias, books of poetry, and other literary, artistic, performing, sound recording, or broadcast works, or other works other than those enumerated in the definition of works in this license, each of which consists of independent works assembled without modification, and which by their selection and arrangement constitute an intellectual creation. A work is a work. A work that constitutes a collective work is not considered a derivative work for the purposes of this license. A derivative work is a work that is based on a work or on another work that previously existed with the work. Examples include translations, adaptations, derivatives, arrangements of musical works, other alterations of literary or artistic works, sound recordings, performances, alterations to a motion picture work, and all other forms of alteration of a work, including alterations in a form recognizable as being derived from the original work. However, works that constitute a collective work shall not be considered derivative works for the purposes of this license. For the avoidance of doubt, musical works, performances and sound recordings that are synchronized with the motion picture shall be considered derivative works for the purposes of this license. For the avoidance of doubt, synchronized musical works, performances and recordings are derivative works under this license. Public performance is defined as: the public recitation of a work and its transmission to the public by any means or procedure, including wire, radio or public digital performance; making the work available to the public in such a way as to enable the public to access the work where it exists, at a place of their choosing. Includes digital performances in public and refers to the public performance of a work by any means or procedure, and to the broadcasting or rebroadcasting of a work by any means or procedure, including signals, sounds or images.\nActions:\n- Reproduce the work.\n- Incorporate a work into one or more collective works\n- Reproduce a work incorporated into a collective work\n- Distribute copies of the work (including works incorporated into a collective work)\n- Distributing a medium on which a recording of a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work) is made\n- Publicly perform a work (including a work incorporated into a collective work)\n\nConditions:\nAND\n  RESTRICTION: Exercise rights in all current and future media and formats\n  RESTRICTION: Make technical changes for use in other media or formats, if necessary\n  OBLIGATION: Include a copy of this license or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) identifying this license\n  RESTRICTION: Does not present or impose conditions that alter or limit the rights of the recipient to exercise under this license\n  RESTRICTION: No sublicensing of copyrighted material.

For the avoidance of doubt:\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to \n             collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the \n             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of \n             the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect \n             royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor \n             waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights \n             granted under this License; and,\n\n        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether \n             individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that \n             administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the \n             rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must \n       include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of \n       the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work \n       that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise \n       the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the \n       Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of \n       warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or \n       Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work \n       that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to \n       that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as \n       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself \n       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any \n       Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by \n       Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has \n       been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, \n       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or \n       pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate \n       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution \n       (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable \n       means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the \n       extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the \n       Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the \n       Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; \n       provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a \n       credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and \n       in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the \n       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of \n       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may \n       not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by \n       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of \n       the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor \n       and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by \n       applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as \n       part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in \n       relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You \n       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under \n       this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or \n       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive \n       any termination of this License.\n\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration \n       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right \n       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; \n       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other \n       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this \n       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the \n       recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You \n       under this License.\n\n    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not \n       affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without \n       further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \n       extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \n       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or \n       consent.\n\n    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work \n       licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work \n       not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in \n       any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement \n       of the Licensor and You.\n\n    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted \n       utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic \n       Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty \n       of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright \n       Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the \n       relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the \n       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable \n       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes \n       additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included \n       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under \n       applicable law.\n\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. \n\nLicense\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\&quot;CCPL\&quot; OR \&quot;LICENSE\&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n    a. \&quot;Adaptation\&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such \n       as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a \n       literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or \n       any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form \n       recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not \n       be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the \n       Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in \n       timed-relation with a moving image (\&quot;synching\&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose \n       of this License.\n\n    b. \&quot;Collection\&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and \n       anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other \n       than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of \n       their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety \n       in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and \n       independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that \n       constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes \n       of this License.\n\n    c. \&quot;Distribute\&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through \n       sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n    d. \&quot;Licensor\&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the \n       terms of this License.\n\n    e. \&quot;Original Author\&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, \n       entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the \n       publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, \n       dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise \n       perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the \n       producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other \n       sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n    f. \&quot;Work\&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including \n       without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be \n       the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other \n       writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or \n       dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition \n       with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a \n       process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, \n       engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a \n       process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or \n       three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; \n       a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable \n       work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise \n       considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n    g. \&quot;You\&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously \n       violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express \n       permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n    h. \&quot;Publicly Perform\&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the \n       public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or \n       public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of \n       the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to \n       perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the \n       performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast \n       the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n    i. \&quot;Reproduce\&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or \n       visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including \n       storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the \n       Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,\n\n    b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\n\n    c. For the avoidance of doubt:\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to \n             collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the \n             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of \n             the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect \n             royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor \n             waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights \n             granted under this License; and,\n\n        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether \n             individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that \n             administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the \n             rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must \n       include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of \n       the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work \n       that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise \n       the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the \n       Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of \n       warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or \n       Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work \n       that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to \n       that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as \n       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself \n       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any \n       Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by \n       Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has \n       been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, \n       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or \n       pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate \n       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution \n       (\&quot;Attribution Parties\&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable \n       means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the \n       extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the \n       Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the \n       Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; \n       provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a \n       credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and \n       in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the \n       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of \n       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may \n       not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by \n       the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of \n       the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor \n       and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by \n       applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as \n       part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in \n       relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You \n       of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under \n       this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or \n       entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive \n       any termination of this License.\n\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration \n       of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right \n       to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; \n       provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other \n       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this \n       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the \n       recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You \n       under this License.\n\n    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not \n       affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without \n       further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \n       extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \n       waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or \n       consent.\n\n    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work \n       licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work \n       not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in \n       any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement \n       of the Licensor and You.\n\n    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted \n       utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic \n       Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty \n       of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright \n       Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the \n       relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the \n       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable \n       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes \n       additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included \n       in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under \n       applicable law.\n\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \&quot;Creative Commons\&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons&#39; then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this License.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.&quot;,
