Article 2 (Grant of License)

The Licensor grants to the Recipient a license to use the Licensed Program in any and all countries in accordance with each of the provisions set forth in this Agreement. However, any and all rights underlying in the Licensed Program shall be held by the Licensor. In no sense is this Agreement intended to transfer any right relating to the Licensed Program held by the Licensor except as specifically set forth herein or any right relating to any trademark, trade name, or service mark to the Recipient.

6.         The Recipient may reproduce the Licensed Program as is without modification and transfer such copies, publicly transmit or otherwise redistribute the Licensed Program to a third party for commercial or non-commercial purposes (&quot;Redistribute&quot;), in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 3 Paragraph 2.

(2)                It is required to also Redistribute means to enable recipients of the Derived Program to replace the Derived Program with the Licensed Program first released under this License (the &quot;Original Program&quot;).  Such means may be to provide a difference file from the Original Program, or instructions setting out a method to replace the Derived Program with the Original Program.

(3)                The Recipient must license the Derived Program under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(4)                No one may use or include the name of the Licensed Program as a program name, font name or file name of the Derived Program.

4.         The Licensor is under no obligation to respond to any technical questions or inquiries, or provide any other user support in connection with the installation, use or the Reproduction and Other Exploitation of the Licensed Program or Derived Programs thereof.
