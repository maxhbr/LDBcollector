These *.tsv files are the original source files used to create the
TOML files with the license data.  They came from a Google Spreadsheet
over the course of a year of discussions and meetings combing through
Fedora's license information on the wiki and various documentation
sources.

Here's how these files map to the TOML collections:

bad.tsv                -> not-approved/
good-content.tsv       -> approved-content/
good-documentation.tsv -> approved-documentation/
good-fonts.tsv         -> approved-fonts/
good.tsv               -> approved/
